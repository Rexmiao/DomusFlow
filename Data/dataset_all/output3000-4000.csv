Title,Abstract
States,"In 1998, Barbara Ehrenreich, a journalist and activist then in her late 50s, sets out to document the daily struggles of America’s working poor. Having trained as a biologist, she decides to do fieldwork: in three different U.S. cities, she takes minimum-wage jobs and looks for affordable places to live. She leaves her Ph.D. and most of her skills off of her applications, to ensure that she is given the lowest-level positions available to a white, native-English speaking woman. However, she will use outside cash, if necessary, to ensure that she will never be without a car, she will not have to skip meals to save money, and she will never be homeless.
Ehrenreich’s first experiences are in Key West, Florida. Her most affordable living option, cheaper than a trailer in town, is a shabby efficiency apartment thirty miles away. Although she expects to earn $7 per hour, the first job she lands, as a diner waitress, pays much less, because she will also earn tips. The job requires not only serving tables but also additional work, like cleaning and restocking. Although Ehrenreich gets along well with her coworkers, she struggles as a waitress, because of her lack of experience. Realizing that she will not be able to stay in her apartment on what she is earning, she tries takes a second waitressing job, at another diner. She quickly realizes she will be physically unable to work both jobs, quits the first job, and takes a hotel housekeeping job next door to the second diner, instead. However, when her supervisor at the second diner yells at her, Ehrenreich has had enough and walks out.
Ehrenreich’s next location is Portland, Maine. There, after much searching, she finds a small apartment she will be able to afford. She takes two jobs. The first is with a maid service that cleans the homes of affluent clients where she works on a cleaning team with several other women. The work is back-breaking, and Ehrenreich develops a skin rash of unknown origin. She sees the other women continue to work even when they are injured or feeling sick. She notices that the cleaning techniques the team is taught to use are more about making homes look cleaner than about actually cleaning them. She learns that her employer charges customers $25 per person-hour, while she will earn $6.65 an hour. Ehrenreich’s other job is at a nursing home, where she helps serve food to residents with Alzheimer’s. The interactions with the residents are pleasant, but the cleanup work after meals is overwhelming, partly because one of the automatic dishwashers is broken.
In Minneapolis, Minnesota, finally, Ehrenreich has a very hard time finding safe, sanitary housing she can afford. A charity worker suggests that she check into a shelter while saving up first month’s rent. She has two job applications accepted, but backs out of one job, at a hardware store, when her very first shift is scheduled to last eleven hours without overtime pay. The other job is in women’s clothing at Wal-Mart. The day-long orientation for new employees includes criticism of labor unions, while the pay is less than typical for the area. The store layout is constantly changing, and customers make extra work for her by leaving unbought merchandise in other departments. The job makes Ehrenreich, by her own account, callous and spiteful. Meanwhile, she has been unable to secure a long-term rental situation. Fed up, at one of the employee meetings she starts talking about the need for a union. By now, she has already decided to quit.
Reviewing her experiences in light of the data from many different studies, Ehrenreich comes to several conclusions. She finds that workers cannot support themselves on minimum wage in America unless they work multiple jobs, and only so long as there are no unexpected expenses, such as for medical care. Ehrenreich also finds that employers try to keep information about the wages they pay from becoming general knowledge among workers. Additionally, she finds that the ways in which workers are supervised, including random urine tests for drug use, encourage the workers to accept being dehumanized. Ehrenreich adds that the attitudes found in managers of low-wage employees are based on class or racial prejudice. Finally, she states that medical benefits and child care are too expensive even for middle-class workers, let alone ones on minimum wage. She notes that perhaps someday the working poor will refuse to stop accepting their situation and will demand that things change—and concludes that the country will be a better place when they do."
Temptation,"The Bottom is a mostly Black community in Ohio, situated in the hills above the mostly white, wealthier community of Medallion. The Bottom first became a community when a master gave it to his former slave. This ""gift"" was in fact a trick: the master gave the former slave a poor stretch of hilly land, convincing the slave the land was worthwhile by claiming that because it was hilly, it was closer to heaven. The trick, though, led to the growth of a vibrant community. Now the community faces a new threat; wealthy whites have taken a liking to the land, and would like to destroy much of the town in order to build a golf course.
Shadrack, a resident of the Bottom, fought in WWI. He returns a shattered man, unable to accept the complexities of the world; he lives on the outskirts of town, attempting to create order in his life. One of his methods involves compartmentalizing his fear of death in a ritual he invents and names National Suicide Day. The town is at first wary of him and his ritual, then, over time, unthinkingly accepts him.
Meanwhile, the families of the children Nel and Sula are contrasted. Nel is the product of a family that believes deeply in social conventions; hers is a stable home, though some might characterize it as rigid. Nel is uncertain of the conventional life her mother, Helene, wants for her; these doubts are hammered home when she meets Rochelle, her grandmother and a former prostitute, the only unconventional woman in her family line. Sula's family is very different: she lives with her grandmother, Eva, and her mother, Hannah, both of whom are seen by the town as eccentric and loose. Their house also serves as a home for three informally adopted boys and a steady stream of borders.
Despite their differences, Sula and Nel become fiercely attached to each other during adolescence. However, a traumatic accident changes everything. One day, Sula playfully swings a neighborhood boy, Chicken Little, around by his hands. When she loses her grip, the boy falls into a nearby river and drowns. They never tell anyone about the accident even though they did not intend to harm the boy. The two girls begin to grow apart. One day, in an accident, Sula's mother's dress catches fire and she dies of the burns.
After high school, Nel chooses to marry and settles into the conventional role of wife and mother. Sula follows a wildly divergent path and lives a life of fierce independence and total disregard for social conventions. Shortly after Nel's wedding, Sula leaves the Bottom for a period of 10 years. She has many affairs, some with white men. However, she finds people following the same boring routines elsewhere, so she returns to the Bottom and to Nel.
Upon her return, the town regards Sula as the very personification of evil for her blatant disregard of social conventions. Their hatred in part rests upon Sula's interracial relationships, but is crystallized when Sula has an affair with Nel's husband, Jude, who subsequently abandons Nel. Ironically, the community's labeling of Sula as evil actually improves their own lives. Her presence in the community gives them the impetus to live harmoniously with one another. Nel breaks off her friendship with Sula. Just before Sula dies in 1940, they achieve a half-hearted reconciliation. With Sula's death, the harmony that had reigned in the town quickly dissolves.
In 1965, with the Bottom facing the prospect of the white golf course, Nel visits Eva in the nursing home. Eva accuses her of sharing the guilt for Chicken Little's death. Her accusation forces Nel to confront the unfairness of her judgment against Sula. Nel admits to herself that she had blamed his death entirely on Sula and set herself up as the ""good"" half of the relationship. Nel comes to realize that in the aftermath of Chicken Little's death she had too quickly clung to social convention in an effort to define herself as ""good."" Nel goes to the cemetery and mourns at Sula's grave, calling out Sula's name in sadness.
Sula is a novel about ambiguity. It questions and examines the terms ""good"" and ""evil,"" often demonstrating that the two often resemble one another. The novel addresses the confusing mysteries of human emotions and relationships, ultimately concluding that social conventions are inadequate as a foundation for living one's life. The novel tempts the reader to apply the diametrically opposed terms of ""good and evil,"" ""right and wrong"" to the characters and their actions, and yet simultaneously shows why it is necessary to resist such temptation. While exploring the ways in which people try to make meaning of lives filled with conflicts over race, gender, and simple idiosyncratic points of views, Sula resists easy answers, demonstrating the ambiguity, beauty, and terror of life, in both its triumphs and horrors."
Public,"The full title of Swift's pamphlet is ""A Modest Proposal for Preventing the Children of Poor People from Being a Burthen to their Parents, or the Country, and for Making them Beneficial to the Publick."" The tract is an ironically conceived attempt to ""find out a fair, cheap, and easy Method"" for converting the starving children of Ireland into ""sound and useful members of the Commonwealth."" Across the country poor children, predominantly Catholics, are living in squalor because their families are too poor to keep them fed and clothed.
The author argues, by hard-edged economic reasoning as well as from a self-righteous moral stance, for a way to turn this problem into its own solution. His proposal, in effect, is to fatten up these undernourished children and feed them to Ireland's rich land-owners. Children of the poor could be sold into a meat market at the age of one, he argues, thus combating overpopulation and unemployment, sparing families the expense of child-bearing while providing them with a little extra income, improving the culinary experience of the wealthy, and contributing to the overall economic well-being of the nation.
The author offers statistical support for his assertions and gives specific data about the number of children to be sold, their weight and price, and the projected consumption patterns. He suggests some recipes for preparing this delicious new meat, and he feels sure that innovative cooks will be quick to generate more. He also anticipates that the practice of selling and eating children will have positive effects on family morality: husbands will treat their wives with more respect, and parents will value their children in ways hitherto unknown. His conclusion is that the implementation of this project will do more to solve Ireland's complex social, political, and economic problems than any other measure that has been proposed."
Animated,Video SparkNotes: A Summary of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
Understand,"Lawyer Bryan Stevenson gives a first-person account of his decades helping marginalized Americans who have been unfairly and harshly punished by the U.S. criminal justice system, which disproportionately targets people of color and poor people. At the heart of Just Mercy is the story of Walter McMillian, a Black man who was framed for the murder of a girl named Ronda Morrison, convicted, and sent to death row. 
Stevenson alternates chapters about Walter with his personal reflections on our country’s history with racial disparity and issues around incarceration. Stevenson highlights other groups of vulnerable people who have been victimized by the criminal justice system and shares the stories of the prisoners he has helped over the years. The book also follows the growth of Stevenson’s nonprofit law project, the Alabama-based Equal Justice Initiative (EJI), through its expansion from focusing on death row prisoners to helping people sentenced to life without parole. Stevenson chronicles how EJI becomes a significant force in criminal justice reform.
In 1983 as a law student, Stevenson discovers his life’s passion when he interns with the Georgia-based Southern Prisoners Defense Committee and meets his first death row prisoner. After graduation Stevenson accepts a job with the organization to represent poor prisoners, including those in Alabama who lack any public defender. He meets Walter McMillian on Alabama’s death row. Walter owns a successful business but also transgresses racial boundaries when he has an affair with a white woman. Soon after the affair becomes public, the woman’s friend, Ralph Myers, accuses Walter of committing the unsolved murder of Ronda Morrison, which has outraged the community. Law enforcement, including a racist sheriff and the district attorney, eagerly pounces on this accusation, overlooking Walter’s alibi and a lack of evidence. Instead, they actively force Ralph to stick with his story even when he tries to recant. They coerce other false witness testimonies, and—as revealed years later—actively suppress evidence.
After Stevenson and the team at EJI unsuccessfully appeal Walter’s conviction, they launch their own investigation of the crime and uncover new evidence. They find witnesses who can prove the witnesses against Walter lied as well as financial records that indicate that one of these witnesses was paid to give false testimony. Stevenson and his team also petition for and receive all records from Walter’s trial. However, their big break comes when they receive a phone call from Ralph, who now wants to make amends. Ralph admits to lying about Walter and says he was threatened by law enforcement. Stevenson wins a hearing for Walter where he can present his new evidence: Ralph’s testimony, which is confirmed by health care workers and other inmates, as well as recordings of the law enforcement team threatening Ralph if he doesn’t frame Walter. 
While the judge refuses to grant Walter relief, Stevenson continues the appeal process through the Alabama courts. The district attorney asks outside agents to investigate the murder for which Walter was convicted, and the investigators determine that Walter had nothing to do with the crime. Six weeks later, the court invalidates Walter’s conviction. Stevenson and the State file a joint motion to dismiss the charges, and Walter is set free.
Throughout the process, Stevenson and Walter become close friends, and Stevenson helps Walter upon his release, including filing a civil suit on his behalf and offering him a place to stay. Walter works with Stevenson to share his story, giving interviews and speaking at legal conferences, and Walter is even featured in a documentary. Unfortunately, Walter is diagnosed with advancing dementia and is forced to rely on family and eventually a nursing facility for his care. He dies in 2013. Stevenson gives a eulogy at his funeral and shares all he learned from Walter, particularly that we must extend mercy to everyone, even those who have not earned it.
Interspersed with chapters chronicling Walter’s narrative are stories of Stevenson’s other clients and work. His closeness with these prisoners and their horrifying circumstances makes Stevenson more determined to help and causes him to reflect on abstract issues that nevertheless imbue the criminal justice system, like humanity and mercy. Stevenson focuses on several categories of vulnerable people who become trapped in the system, including mentally ill prisoners, disabled prisoners, and poor women who give birth to stillborn babies. 
Stevenson and his team at EJI also become increasingly focused on juvenile offenders who are sometimes tried as adults despite their young age. These offenders may be given de facto death sentences by being sentenced to life without parole and face perilous circumstances when they are housed in adult prisons. Stevenson illustrates how these prisoners retain their own humanity while being forced to live under inhumane conditions. He also discusses some of the qualities common among these types of prisoners: They are generally poor and disproportionately people of color, and most of them lack adequate legal counsel. The juveniles have horrific backgrounds of abuse and neglect.
Stevenson and his team at EJI also work to change the legal system to offer more protection to marginalized people. Several of his cases end up before the U.S. Supreme Court, and he succeeds in winning rulings that ban as unconstitutional the conviction of children to life without parole and the execution of people deemed incompetent from dementia or neurological disease. EJI works to raise public awareness of issues surrounding unfair incarceration, produces groundbreaking reports on racial issues, and sets up programs to help formerly incarcerated people adjust to life on the outside.
Stevenson also reflects on the issues that surround the criminal justice system. His time spent with prisoners awaiting their execution makes him realize how inhumane it is to prepare another human to die. After decades of work, when Stevenson fails to prevent the execution of a man who suffers from an intellectual disability, he momentarily feels unable to continue his work. However, he realizes that he cannot help but be broken by his experiences and comes to understand that it is his own brokenness that allows him to more fully understand the need for mercy and to bring compassion to others. The book ends with Stevenson’s renewed commitment to helping others."
Keeping,"In “moon,” the first of the four parts of feed, an American teenager named Titus travels to the lunar surface with his high-school friends for spring break, hoping to escape the boredom they feel on Earth. No specific date is revealed, though it’s sometime in a dystopic future, where the moon is fully commercialized and people suffer from red sores called lesions. As Titus and his fellow upper-class friends Link, Marty, Calista, Loga, and Quendy arrive on the moon, readers also get their first glimpse of “the feed.” Although Titus doesn’t initially reveal exact details about the feed or how it works, he says it sends the friends ads and images for where to stay and shop. 
After failing to get into college-age parties, the group visits the Ricochet Lounge, where Titus becomes infatuated with a girl named Violet. She is beautiful and, he soon finds, visiting the moon by herself and is very unlike his friends: She doesn’t make pointless purchases at a mall they all soon visit and isn’t interested in malfunctioning, or falling into a drug-like stupor, via their connections to the feed. Later, when they all visit a dance club called the Rumble Spot, an old man from a dissenter group called the Coalition of Pity hacks into people’s individual feeds, causing them to broadcast the signal, “we enter a time of calamity” over the feed’s network. Police beat the man and “shut off” those hacked, including Titus and Violet, who hold hands as they collapse.
Part 2, “eden,” occurs in a lunar hospital where Violet, Titus, and his friends remain disconnected from the feed until their systems can be scanned for viruses. There, Titus provides additional details about what the feed is and how it works. Feeds are implanted inside the body and connect to a global network that provides news, entertainment, and a means to purchase every kind of product, he says while singing its praises. The feed even anticipates and creates users’ wants from individual profiles based on purchasing decisions, thoughts, and feelings. Titus and Violet grow closer during the stay. Violet, who’s home-schooled and smarter than Titus and his friends, says she hoped to enjoy herself like normal kids but now has a problem, though she remains vague about what this problem is. When doctors finally restore the friends’ feeds, they rejoice. Promotions begin to flow through their minds again, though there’s also ominous news concerning protests over America’s annexation of the moon and resulting anger from a group called the Global Alliance. Still, Titus says, the friends exalt in the return of their feeds.
In Part 3, “Utopia,” Titus and his friends return to Earth and life returns to normal for them: “upcars” travel in tubes past vertically stacked suburbs, the friends party, and U.S. President Trumbull scoffs at reports that claim toxic industries cause lesions. In defiance of rampant consumerism and a loss of individuality, Violet determines to resist the feed by creating a completely random customer profile and asks Titus to join her. Violet, who didn’t receive her feed until she was seven, voices deep concern about the decline of the world and destruction of Earth, and laments how those who’ve had the feed their entire lives are ignorant and self-centered. Titus soon has nightmares that are more likely hacks from the Coalition of Pity. In them, he sees disturbing images of eco destruction and human suffering around the world, but after Violet chats him, saying she has seen the images too, he only wants to go back to sleep.
Before long, Violet’s problem becomes clear: Her body begins to fail and she’s told by doctors that the damage to her feedware can be fatal. The prognosis makes Violet realize how much she wants to do. She starts by going to the seashore with Titus, though they need to dress in protective suits due to its toxicity. Meanwhile, feed chatter reveals that all of Earth’s forests have fallen and there is a growing rift between the U.S. and the Global Alliance. At a party where Quendy shows off her artificial lesions, Violet becomes outraged and her body falters. She chastises Titus and his friends for living in ignorance as the world dies, then collapses and is brought to the hospital. 
Violet’s condition declines further in Part 4, “slumberland,” whose chapter titles track her feed efficiency from a high of 87.3 percent to a low of 4.6 percent, 98 percent being optimal. Aware that she doesn’t have much time, Violet messages Titus a list of twenty-two things she wants to do in life, though he grows increasingly distant, and doesn’t message back. When they do reconnect, Violet sends Titus a recent memory where she falls down a staircase and receives a response from the corporation FeedTech, denying her petition to pay for her system repairs because she wasn’t deemed to be worthy due to her random customer profile. Violet later sends Titus childhood memories to preserve her history, though he deletes them. And when Violet convinces him to visit the mountains with her, one of her life goals, Titus breaks up with her, saying he was only interested in a short relationship while she wanted something eternal. 
Time passes and Titus eventually hears from Violet’s father. At Violet’s home, Titus sees her lying on a floating bed, completely pale, fully incapacitated, and covered in discs. Her father details her final, painful days and how her body failed. He then berates Titus for how badly he treated Violet and for willfully living in ignorance. Titus later visits Violet’s home a second time. Although she appears dead, her feed efficiency is at 4.6 percent and a screen shows that her heart is beating slightly. Nevertheless, Titus tells Violet a story he plans to keep telling her, he says, so she will remember herself. The story is about Violet, the end of America, and their relationship, where they learn something important about love and how to resist the feed. The book ends with a promotion on the feed for Blue-Jean Warehouse’s Final Sales Event and a recurring, fading message that “Everything must go.”"
Gaul,"All Quiet on the Western Front is narrated by Paul Bäumer, a young man of nineteen who fights in the German army on the French front in World War I. Paul and several of his friends from school joined the army voluntarily after listening to the stirring patriotic speeches of their teacher, Kantorek. But after experiencing ten weeks of brutal training at the hands of the petty, cruel Corporal Himmelstoss and the unimaginable brutality of life on the front, Paul and his friends have realized that the ideals of nationalism and patriotism for which they enlisted are simply empty clichés. They no longer believe that war is glorious or honorable, and they live in constant physical terror.
When Paul’s company receives a short reprieve after two weeks of fighting, only eighty men of the original 150-man company return from the front. The cook doesn’t want to give the survivors the rations that were meant for the dead men but eventually agrees to do so; the men thus enjoy a large meal. Paul and his friends visit Kemmerich, a former classmate who has recently had a leg amputated after contracting gangrene. Kemmerich is slowly dying, and Müller, another former classmate, wants Kemmerich’s boots for himself. Paul doesn’t consider Müller insensitive; like the other soldiers, Müller simply realizes pragmatically that Kemmerich no longer needs his boots. Surviving the agony of war, Paul observes, forces one to learn to disconnect oneself from emotions like grief, sympathy, and fear. Not long after this encounter, Paul returns to Kemmerich’s bedside just as the young man dies. At Kemmerich’s request, Paul takes his boots to Müller.
A group of new recruits comes to reinforce the company, and Paul’s friend Kat produces a beef and bean stew that impresses them. Kat says that if all the men in an army, including the officers, were paid the same wage and given the same food, wars would be over immediately. Kropp, another of Paul’s former classmates, says that there should be no armies; he argues that a nation’s leaders should instead fight out their disagreements with clubs. They discuss the fact that petty, insignificant people become powerful and arrogant during war, and Tjaden, a member of Paul’s company, announces that the cruel Corporal Himmelstoss has come to fight at the front.
At night, the men go on a harrowing mission to lay barbed wire at the front. Pounded by artillery, they hide in a graveyard, where the force of the shelling causes the buried corpses to emerge from their graves, as groups of living men fall dead around them. After this gruesome event, the surviving soldiers return to their camp, where they kill lice and think about what they will do at the end of the war. Some of the men have tentative plans, but all of them seem to feel that the war will never end. Paul fears that if the war did end, he wouldn’t know what to do with himself. Himmelstoss arrives at the front; when the men see him, Tjaden insults him. The men’s lieutenant gives them light punishment but also lectures Himmelstoss about the futility of saluting at the front. Paul and Kat find a house with a goose and roast the goose for supper, enjoying a rare good meal.
The company is caught in a bloody battle with a charging group of Allied infantrymen. Men are blown apart, limbs are severed from torsos, and giant rats pick at the dead and the wounded. Paul feels that he must become an animal in battle, trusting only his instincts to keep him alive. After the battle, only thirty-two of eighty men are still alive. The men are given a short reprieve at a field depot. Paul and some of his friends go for a swim, which ends in a rendezvous with a group of French girls. Paul desperately wishes to recapture his innocence with a girl, but he feels that it is impossible to do so.
Paul receives seventeen days of leave and goes home to see his family. He feels awkward and oppressed in his hometown, unable to discuss his traumatic experiences with anyone. He learns that his mother is dying of cancer and that Kantorek has been conscripted as a soldier, from which he derives a certain cold satisfaction. He visits Kemmerich’s mother and tells her, untruthfully, that her son’s death was instant and painless. At the end of his leave, Paul spends some time at a training camp near a group of Russian prisoners-of-war. Paul feels that the Russians are people just like him, not subhuman enemies, and wonders how war can make enemies of people who have no grudge against one another.
Paul is sent back to his company and is reunited with his friends. The kaiser, the German emperor, pays a visit to the front, and the men are disappointed to see that he is merely a short man with a weak voice. In battle, Paul is separated from his company and forced to hide in a shell hole. A French soldier jumps into the shell hole with him, and Paul instinctively stabs him. As the man dies a slow, painful death, Paul is overcome with remorse for having hurt him. He feels again that this enemy soldier is no enemy at all but rather a victim of war just like himself. Paul looks through the soldier’s things and finds that his name was Gérard Duval and learns that Duval had a wife and child at home. When he returns to his company, Paul recounts the incident to his friends, who try to console him.
Paul and his friends are given an easy assignment: for three weeks, they are to guard a supply depot away from the fighting. When the next battle takes place, Paul and Kropp are wounded and forced to bribe a sergeant-major with cigars in order to be placed on the hospital train together. At the hospital, Paul undergoes surgery. Kropp’s leg is amputated, and he becomes extremely depressed. After his surgery, Paul has a short leave at home before he returns to his company.
As the German army begins to give in to the unrelenting pressure of the Allied forces, Paul’s friends are killed in combat one by one. Detering, one of Paul’s close friends, attempts to desert but is caught and court-martialed. Kat is killed when a piece of shrapnel slices his head open while Paul is carrying him to safety. By the fall of 1918, Paul is the only one of his circle of friends who is still alive. Soldiers everywhere whisper that the Germans will soon surrender and that peace will come. Paul is poisoned in a gas attack and given a short leave. He reflects that, when the war ends, he will be ruined for peacetime; all he knows is the war. In October 1918, on a day with very little fighting, Paul is killed. The army report for that day reads simply: “All quiet on the Western Front.” Paul’s corpse wears a calm expression, as though relieved that the end has come at last."
Charged,"The year is 1775, and social ills plague both France and England. Jerry Cruncher, an odd-job man who works for Tellson’s Bank, stops the Dover mail-coach with an urgent message for Jarvis Lorry. The message instructs Lorry to wait at Dover for a young woman, and Lorry responds with the cryptic words, “Recalled to Life.” At Dover, Lorry is met by Lucie Manette, a young orphan whose father, a once-eminent doctor whom she supposed dead, has been discovered in France. Lorry escorts Lucie to Paris, where they meet Defarge, a former servant of Doctor Manette, who has kept Manette safe in a garret. Driven mad by eighteen years in the Bastille, Manette spends all of his time making shoes, a hobby he learned while in prison. Lorry assures Lucie that her love and devotion can recall her father to life, and indeed they do.
The year is now 1780. Charles Darnay stands accused of treason against the English crown. A bombastic lawyer named Stryver pleads Darnay’s case, but it is not until his drunk, good-for-nothing colleague, Sydney Carton, assists him that the court acquits Darnay. Carton clinches his argument by pointing out that he himself bears an uncanny resemblance to the defendant, which undermines the prosecution’s case for unmistakably identifying Darnay as the spy the authorities spotted. Lucie and Doctor Manette watched the court proceedings, and that night, Carton escorts Darnay to a tavern and asks how it feels to receive the sympathy of a woman like Lucie. Carton despises and resents Darnay because he reminds him of all that he himself has given up and might have been.
In France, the cruel Marquis Evrémonde runs down a plebian child with his carriage. Manifesting an attitude typical of the aristocracy in regard to the poor at that time, the Marquis shows no regret, but instead curses the peasantry and hurries home to his chateau, where he awaits the arrival of his nephew, Darnay, from England. Arriving later that night, Darnay curses his uncle and the French aristocracy for its abominable treatment of the people. He renounces his identity as an Evrémonde and announces his intention to return to England. That night, the Marquis is murdered; the murderer has left a note signed with the nickname adopted by French revolutionaries: “Jacques.”
A year passes, and Darnay asks Manette for permission to marry Lucie. He says that, if Lucie accepts, he will reveal his true identity to Manette. Carton, meanwhile, also pledges his love to Lucie, admitting that, though his life is worthless, she has helped him dream of a better, more valuable existence. On the streets of London, Jerry Cruncher gets swept up in the funeral procession for a spy named Roger Cly. Later that night, he demonstrates his talents as a “Resurrection-Man,” sneaking into the cemetery to steal and sell Cly’s body. In Paris, meanwhile, another English spy known as John Barsad drops into Defarge’s wine shop. Barsad hopes to turn up evidence concerning the mounting revolution, which is still in its covert stages. Madame Defarge sits in the shop knitting a secret registry of those whom the revolution seeks to execute. Back in London, Darnay, on the morning of his wedding, keeps his promise to Manette; he reveals his true identity and, that night, Manette relapses into his old prison habit of making shoes. After nine days, Manette regains his presence of mind, and soon joins the newlyweds on their honeymoon. Upon Darnay’s return, Carton pays him a visit and asks for his friendship. Darnay assures Carton that he is always welcome in their home.
The year is now 1789. The peasants in Paris storm the Bastille and the French Revolution begins. The revolutionaries murder aristocrats in the streets, and Gabelle, a man charged with the maintenance of the Evrémonde estate, is imprisoned. Three years later, he writes to Darnay, asking to be rescued. Despite the threat of great danger to his person, Darnay departs immediately for France.
As soon as Darnay arrives in Paris, the French revolutionaries arrest him as an emigrant. Lucie and Manette make their way to Paris in hopes of saving him. Darnay remains in prison for a year and three months before receiving a trial. In order to help free him, Manette uses his considerable influence with the revolutionaries, who sympathize with him for having served time in the Bastille. Darnay receives an acquittal, but that same night he is arrested again. The charges, this time, come from Defarge and his vengeful wife. Carton arrives in Paris with a plan to rescue Darnay and obtains the help of John Barsad, who turns out to be Solomon Pross, the long-lost brother of Miss Pross, Lucie’s loyal servant.
At Darnay’s trial, Defarge produces a letter that he discovered in Manette’s old jail cell in the Bastille. The letter explains the cause of Manette’s imprisonment. Years ago, the brothers Evrémonde (Darnay’s father and uncle) enlisted Manette’s medical assistance. They asked him to tend to a woman, whom one of the brothers had raped, and her brother, whom the same brother had stabbed fatally. Fearing that Manette might report their misdeeds, the Evrémondes had him arrested. Upon hearing this story, the jury condemns Darnay for the crimes of his ancestors and sentences him to die within twenty-four hours. That night, at the Defarge’s wine shop, Carton overhears Madame Defarge plotting to have Lucie and her daughter (also Darnay’s daughter) executed as well; Madame Defarge, it turns out, is the surviving sibling of the man and woman killed by the Evrémondes. Carton arranges for the Manettes’ immediate departure from France. He then visits Darnay in prison, tricks him into changing clothes with him, and, after dictating a letter of explanation, drugs his friend unconscious. Barsad carries Darnay, now disguised as Carton, to an awaiting coach, while Carton, disguised as Darnay, awaits execution. As Darnay, Lucie, their child, and Dr. Manette speed away from Paris, Madame Defarge arrives at Lucie’s apartment, hoping to arrest her. There she finds the supremely protective Miss Pross. A scuffle ensues, and Madame Defarge dies by the bullet of her own gun. Sydney Carton meets his death at the guillotine, and the narrator confidently asserts that Carton dies with the knowledge that he has finally imbued his life with meaning."
Executing,"In the midst of a raging war, a plane evacuating a group of schoolboys from Britain is shot down over a deserted tropical island. Two of the boys, Ralph and Piggy, discover a conch shell on the beach, and Piggy realizes it could be used as a horn to summon the other boys. Once assembled, the boys set about electing a leader and devising a way to be rescued. They choose Ralph as their leader, and Ralph appoints another boy, Jack, to be in charge of the boys who will hunt food for the entire group.
Ralph, Jack, and another boy, Simon, set off on an expedition to explore the island. When they return, Ralph declares that they must light a signal fire to attract the attention of passing ships. The boys succeed in igniting some dead wood by focusing sunlight through the lenses of Piggy’s eyeglasses. However, the boys pay more attention to playing than to monitoring the fire, and the flames quickly engulf the forest. A large swath of dead wood burns out of control, and one of the youngest boys in the group disappears, presumably having burned to death.
At first, the boys enjoy their life without grown-ups and spend much of their time splashing in the water and playing games. Ralph, however, complains that they should be maintaining the signal fire and building huts for shelter. The hunters fail in their attempt to catch a wild pig, but their leader, Jack, becomes increasingly preoccupied with the act of hunting.
When a ship passes by on the horizon one day, Ralph and Piggy notice, to their horror, that the signal fire—which had been the hunters’ responsibility to maintain—has burned out. Furious, Ralph accosts Jack, but the hunter has just returned with his first kill, and all the hunters seem gripped with a strange frenzy, reenacting the chase in a kind of wild dance. Piggy criticizes Jack, who hits Piggy across the face. Ralph blows the conch shell and reprimands the boys in a speech intended to restore order. At the meeting, it quickly becomes clear that some of the boys have started to become afraid. The littlest boys, known as “littluns,” have been troubled by nightmares from the beginning, and more and more boys now believe that there is some sort of beast or monster lurking on the island. The older boys try to convince the others at the meeting to think rationally, asking where such a monster could possibly hide during the daytime. One of the littluns suggests that it hides in the sea—a proposition that terrifies the entire group.
Not long after the meeting, some military planes engage in a battle high above the island. The boys, asleep below, do not notice the flashing lights and explosions in the clouds. A parachutist drifts to earth on the signal-fire mountain, dead. Sam and Eric, the twins responsible for watching the fire at night, are asleep and do not see the parachutist land. When the twins wake up, they see the enormous silhouette of his parachute and hear the strange flapping noises it makes. Thinking the island beast is at hand, they rush back to the camp in terror and report that the beast has attacked them.
The boys organize a hunting expedition to search for the monster. Jack and Ralph, who are increasingly at odds, travel up the mountain. They see the silhouette of the parachute from a distance and think that it looks like a huge, deformed ape. The group holds a meeting at which Jack and Ralph tell the others of the sighting. Jack says that Ralph is a coward and that he should be removed from office, but the other boys refuse to vote Ralph out of power. Jack angrily runs away down the beach, calling all the hunters to join him. Ralph rallies the remaining boys to build a new signal fire, this time on the beach rather than on the mountain. They obey, but before they have finished the task, most of them have slipped away to join Jack.
Jack declares himself the leader of the new tribe of hunters and organizes a hunt and a violent, ritual slaughter of a sow to solemnize the occasion. The hunters then decapitate the sow and place its head on a sharpened stake in the jungle as an offering to the beast. Later, encountering the bloody, fly-covered head, Simon has a terrible vision, during which it seems to him that the head is speaking. The voice, which he imagines as belonging to the Lord of the Flies, says that Simon will never escape him, for he exists within all men. Simon faints. When he wakes up, he goes to the mountain, where he sees the dead parachutist. Understanding then that the beast does not exist externally but rather within each individual boy, Simon travels to the beach to tell the others what he has seen. But the others are in the midst of a chaotic revelry—even Ralph and Piggy have joined Jack’s feast—and when they see Simon’s shadowy figure emerge from the jungle, they fall upon him and kill him with their bare hands and teeth.
The following morning, Ralph and Piggy discuss what they have done. Jack’s hunters attack them and their few followers and steal Piggy’s glasses in the process. Ralph’s group travels to Jack’s stronghold in an attempt to make Jack see reason, but Jack orders Sam and Eric tied up and fights with Ralph. In the ensuing battle, one boy, Roger, rolls a boulder down the mountain, killing Piggy and shattering the conch shell. Ralph barely manages to escape a torrent of spears.
Ralph hides for the rest of the night and the following day, while the others hunt him like an animal. Jack has the other boys ignite the forest in order to smoke Ralph out of his hiding place. Ralph stays in the forest, where he discovers and destroys the sow’s head, but eventually, he is forced out onto the beach, where he knows the other boys will soon arrive to kill him. Ralph collapses in exhaustion, but when he looks up, he sees a British naval officer standing over him. The officer’s ship noticed the fire raging in the jungle. The other boys reach the beach and stop in their tracks at the sight of the officer. Amazed at the spectacle of this group of bloodthirsty, savage children, the officer asks Ralph to explain. Ralph is overwhelmed by the knowledge that he is safe but, thinking about what has happened on the island, he begins to weep. The other boys begin to sob as well. The officer turns his back so that the boys may regain their composure."
She,"Speak, by Laurie Halse Anderson, chronicles the struggles of thirteen-year-old Melinda Sordino after she is a raped by at a party the summer before her freshman year of high school by another student. Melinda tells her story in first person narrative. She describes events within the framework of the four marking periods of the school year.
In the opening part of Speak, “First Marking Period,” Melinda begins high school, and we learn that former friends now hate her. She experiences humiliation in the cafeteria and Mr. Neck, a social studies teacher, further embarrasses her by giving her demerits on the first day of school. Ostracized by her former friends, she befriends Heather, a new girl at the school. Heather seeks popularity, and she badgers Melinda to join various clubs. Rachel, Melinda’s ex-best friend, hasn’t tried to find out the truth about what really happened to Melinda that night at the party over the summer.
Melinda describes her classes, activities, and thoughts. Her project in Mr. Freeman’s art class is to create a work of art based on a “tree,” which is the object named on the piece of paper she randomly chooses. In biology, Melinda thinks that David Petrakis, her lab partner, might be cute without the braces. And in algebra, when Mr. Stetman has Rachel come to the board to help Melinda with a problem, Melinda is humiliated. 
Melinda often skips class using stolen late passes and doesn’t complete her homework. She finds refuge at school in a vacant janitor’s closet, which she turns into her “burrow.” At the Homecoming Rally, students bully her for being the one who called the cops that night at the party.
At home, Melinda and her parents communicate with each other by leaving notes on the refrigerator. In her bedroom, she no longer wants to look in the mirror and puts it in the back of her closet. Toward the end of the marking period, Melinda’s parents hear from the school about her missing work, and she remains silent while they berate her for failing. Through it all, Melinda sees “IT” everywhere, the nightmare from which she cannot awaken.
In “Second Marking Period,” school is a grind for Melinda. At her parents’ insistence, she stays after to finish her homework, but she goes to her burrow and naps instead. In social studies, David Petrakis stands up against Mr. Neck’s racist rant about immigration. In biology, she finds that a seed within the apple she has cut is already growing. Heather gives her an early Christmas present, and Melinda decides she’ll give Heather a friendship necklace. 
On Christmas, Melinda nearly tells her parents what happened that night last summer but can’t. Winter break is miserable. Her parents keep her busy working for them, and she is relieved when school starts again. 
In gym class, Melinda impresses the basketball coaches with skills but has no interest in being on the team. She reluctantly helps Heather in her attempts to become an initiated member of a do-good club. And in biology, when she and David dissect a frog, she faints when preparing to slice it open. 
Melinda’s parents receive another call from the guidance counselor about her grades. After their verbal assault, Melinda goes to her room and uses an open paper clip to scrape at her wrist. 
“IT”, who we learn is Andy Evans, harasses Melinda in the cafeteria, and she runs to the bathroom to vomit. She has yet to tell anyone, even the reader, about what happened that summer night.
In “Third Marking Period,” Melinda continues to skip school and avoid Andy Evans. Heather ends their friendship suddenly, and later returns the friendship necklace Melinda had given her for Christmas. No one, Melinda is sure, “would like the inside girl I think I am.” 
The school counselors hold another meeting with Melinda’s parents, who berate and threaten her. She refuses to talk or defend herself. She receives In-School Suspension, and IT is there. He sits next to her and blows in her ear when Mr. Neck isn’t looking. 
In art class, Mr. Freeman gives Melinda a book about Picasso to help her “paralyzed” imagination. Picasso’s art inspires her, and she begins to draw. Mr. Freeman recognizes that she has a lot to say.
Melinda works to meet the expectations set for her. Yet, with “no friends in the known universe,” Melinda sits alone at lunch, wondering if everyone is talking and laughing about her. 
One afternoon, after a basketball game, David Petrakis invites her to his house for pizza to celebrate the team’s one-point win. She declines, torn between getting a life, and the fact that the world is a dangerous place.
At last, Melinda reveals that she was attacked at a party last summer, though she does not use the word “rape.” At this point, we (the readers) are the only ones besides Melinda who know what happened.
In “Fourth Marking Period,” Melinda takes her ex-friend Ivy’s advice and tries drawing a tree instead of carving one from linoleum block. She also learns that Rachel is dating Andy Evans. Compelled to do something, she writes a note to Rachel warning her about Andy. In the note, she admits for the first time (but without divulging her identity), that she was raped. 
Springtime arrives, and Melinda finds solace working in the garden. She and David plan a protest in social studies class over an oral report she is supposed to present, and she stands up to Heather by refusing to help her decorate for the Senior Prom. She writes on a stall in the bathroom, “Guys to Stay Away From: Andy Evans.” Andy Evans continues to bully her. 
Melinda feels compelled to tell Rachel the truth about Andy and what happened that night. But, when Rachel learns that Andy Evans was Melinda’s attacker, she accuses Melinda of being jealous and calls her a “twisted little freak.” Later, Ivy brings Melinda into the bathroom stall. Other girls have added words like “creep” and “bastard” under Andy Evan’s name. Seeing that, Melinda feels like she can fly.
Melinda realizes she doesn’t need her burrow anymore. When she is clearing her items out of the closet, Andy Evans barges in, attacks Melinda, and tries to rape her again. She finds her voice and screams “NNNOOO!!” He does not back off, so Melinda breaks a mirror, takes a shard of glass, and holds it to his neck. “I said no,” she tells him. People who had heard her scream run for help.
With hours left in the school year, Melinda finds herself a sort of hero. She finishes her tree project, receiving an A+ from Mr. Freeman."
Advances,"Anne’s diary begins on her thirteenth birthday, June 12, 1942, and ends shortly after her fifteenth. At the start of her diary, Anne describes fairly typical girlhood experiences, writing about her friendships with other girls, her crushes on boys, and her academic performance at school. Because anti-Semitic laws forced Jews into separate schools, Anne and her older sister, Margot, attended the Jewish Lyceum in Amsterdam.
	The Franks had moved to the Netherlands in the years leading up to World War II to escape persecution in Germany. After the Germans invaded the Netherlands in 1940, the Franks were forced into hiding. With another family, the van Daans, and an acquaintance, Mr. Dussel, they moved into a small secret annex above Otto Frank’s office where they had stockpiled food and supplies. The employees from Otto’s firm helped hide the Franks and kept them supplied with food, medicine, and information about the outside world.
	The residents of the annex pay close attention to every development of the war by listening to the radio. Some bits of news catch Anne’s attention and make their way into her diary, providing a vivid historical context for her personal thoughts. The adults make optimistic bets about when the war will end, and their mood is severely affected by Allied setbacks or German advances. Amsterdam is devastated by the war during the two years the Franks are in hiding. All of the city’s residents suffer, since food becomes scarce and robberies more frequent.
	Anne often writes about her feelings of isolation and loneliness. She has a tumultuous relationship with the adults in the annex, particularly her mother, whom she considers lacking in love and affection. She adores her father, but she is frequently scolded and criticized by Mr. and Mrs. van Daan and Mr. Dussel. Anne thinks that her sister, Margot, is smart, pretty, and agreeable, but she does not feel close to her and does not write much about her. Anne eventually develops a close friendship with Peter van Daan, the teenage boy in the annex. Mr. Frank does not approve, however, and the intensity of Anne’s infatuation begins to lessen.
	Anne matures considerably throughout the course of her diary entries, moving from detailed accounts of basic activities to deeper, more profound thoughts about humanity and her own personal nature. She finds it difficult to understand why the Jews are being singled out and persecuted. Anne also confronts her own identity. Though she considers herself to be German, her German citizenship has been revoked, and though she calls Holland her home, many of the Dutch have turned against the Jews. Anne feels a tremendous solidarity with her aggrieved people, and yet at the same time she wants to be seen as an individual rather than a member of a persecuted group.
During the two years recorded in her diary, Anne deals with confinement and deprivation, as well as the complicated and difficult issues of growing up in the brutal circumstances of the Holocaust. Her diary describes a struggle to define herself within this climate of oppression. Anne’s diary ends without comment on August 1, 1944, the end of a seemingly normal day that leaves us with the expectation of seeing another entry on the next page. However, the Frank family is betrayed to the Nazis and arrested on August 4, 1944. Anne’s diary, the observations of an imaginative, friendly, sometimes petty, and rather normal teenage girl, comes to an abrupt and silent end. 
Otto Frank is the family’s sole survivor, and he recovers Anne’s diary from Miep. He decides to fulfill Anne’s wishes by publishing the diary. Anne’s diary becomes a condemnation of the unimaginable horror of the Holocaust, and one of the few accounts that describe it from a young person’s perspective.
	Since Anne’s diary is a true personal account of a life in hiding, it is inappropriate to analyze it as a novel or other work of fiction. Parts of the diary were intended for public view, but others clearly were not. To appreciate and interpret the diary, it is necessary to consider its horrible context, World War II and the Holocaust, before any discussion of plot development or thematic content."
Long,"The Giver is written from the point of view of Jonas, an eleven-year-old boy living in a futuristic society that has eliminated all pain, fear, war, and hatred. There is no prejudice, since everyone looks and acts basically the same, and there is very little competition. Everyone is unfailingly polite. The society has also eliminated choice: at age twelve every member of the community is assigned a job based on his or her abilities and interests. Citizens can apply for and be assigned compatible spouses, and each couple is assigned exactly two children each. The children are born to Birthmothers, who never see them, and spend their first year in a Nurturing Center with other babies, or “newchildren,” born that year. When their children are grown, family units dissolve and adults live together with Childless Adults until they are too old to function in the society. Then they spend their last years being cared for in the House of the Old until they are finally “released” from the society. In the community, release is death, but it is never described that way; most people think that after release, flawed newchildren and joyful elderly people are welcomed into the vast expanse of Elsewhere that surrounds the communities. Citizens who break rules or fail to adapt properly to the society’s codes of behavior are also released, though in their cases it is an occasion of great shame. Everything is planned and organized so that life is as convenient and pleasant as possible.
Jonas lives with his father, a Nurturer of new children, his mother, who works at the Department of Justice, and his seven-year-old sister Lily. At the beginning of the novel, he is apprehensive about the upcoming Ceremony of Twelve, when he will be given his official Assignment as a new adult member of the community. He does not have a distinct career preference, although he enjoys volunteering at a variety of different jobs. Though he is a well-behaved citizen and a good student, Jonas is different: he has pale eyes, while most people in his community have dark eyes, and he has unusual powers of perception. Sometimes objects “change” when he looks at them. He does not know it yet, but he alone in his community can perceive flashes of color; for everyone else, the world is as devoid of color as it is of pain, hunger, and inconvenience.
At the Ceremony of Twelve, Jonas is given the highly honored Assignment of Receiver of Memory. The Receiver is the sole keeper of the community’s collective memory. When the community went over to Sameness—its painless, warless, and mostly emotionless state of tranquility and harmony—it abandoned all memories of pain, war, and emotion, but the memories cannot disappear totally. Someone must keep them so that the community can avoid making the mistakes of the past, even though no one but the Receiver can bear the pain. Jonas receives the memories of the past, good and bad, from the current Receiver, a wise old man who tells Jonas to call him the Giver.
The Giver transmits memories by placing his hands on Jonas’s bare back. The first memory he receives is of an exhilarating sled ride. As Jonas receives memories from the Giver—memories of pleasure and pain, of bright colors and extreme cold and warm sun, of excitement and terror and hunger and love—he realizes how bland and empty life in his community really is. The memories make Jonas’s life richer and more meaningful, and he wishes that he could give that richness and meaning to the people he loves. But in exchange for their peaceful existence, the people of Jonas’s community have lost the capacity to love him back or to feel deep passion about anything. Since they have never experienced real suffering, they also cannot appreciate the real joy of life, and the life of individual people seems less precious to them. In addition, no one in Jonas’s community has ever made a choice of his or her own. Jonas grows more and more frustrated with the members of his community, and the Giver, who has felt the same way for many years, encourages him. The two grow very close, like a grandfather and a grandchild might have in the days before Sameness, when family members stayed in contact long after their children were grown.
Meanwhile, Jonas is helping his family take care of a problem newchild, Gabriel, who has trouble sleeping through the night at the Nurturing Center. Jonas helps the child to sleep by transmitting soothing memories to him every night, and he begins to develop a relationship with Gabriel that mirrors the family relationships he has experienced through the memories. When Gabriel is in danger of being released, the Giver reveals to Jonas that release is the same as death. Jonas’s rage and horror at this revelation inspire the Giver to help Jonas devise a plan to change things in the community forever. The Giver tells Jonas about the girl who had been designated the new Receiver ten years before. She had been the Giver’s own daughter, but the sadness of some of the memories had been too much for her and she had asked to be released. When she died, all of the memories she had accumulated were released into the community, and the community members could not handle the sudden influx of emotion and sensation. The Giver and Jonas plan for Jonas to escape the community and to actually enter Elsewhere. Once he has done that, his larger supply of memories will disperse, and the Giver will help the community to come to terms with the new feelings and thoughts, changing the society forever.
However, Jonas is forced to leave earlier than planned when his father tells him that Gabriel will be released the next day. Desperate to save Gabriel, Jonas steals his father’s bicycle and a supply of food and sets off for Elsewhere. Gradually, he enters a landscape full of color, animals, and changing weather, but also hunger, danger, and exhaustion. Avoiding search planes, Jonas and Gabriel travel for a long time until heavy snow makes bike travel impossible. Half-frozen, but comforting Gabriel with memories of sunshine and friendship, Jonas mounts a high hill. There he finds a sled—the sled from his first transmitted memory—waiting for him at the top. Jonas and Gabriel experience a glorious downhill ride on the sled. Ahead of them, they see—or think they see—the twinkling lights of a friendly village at Christmas, and they hear music. Jonas is sure that someone is waiting for them there."
Weight,"The Unbearable Lightness of Being opens with a philosophical discussion of lightness versus heaviness. Kundera contrasts Nietzsche's philosophy of eternal return, or of heaviness, with Parmenides's understanding of life as light. Kundera wonders if any meaning or weight can be attributed to life, since there is no eternal return: if man only has the opportunity to try one path, to make one decision, he cannot return to take a different path, and then compare the two lives. Without the ability to co mpare lives, Kundera argues, we cannot find meaning; where meaning should exist we find only an unbearable weightlessness. The uncertain existence of meaning, and the opposition of lightness and heaviness, the key dichotomy of The Unbearable Lightness of Being, sets the stage for the entire novel.
The year is 1968. The protagonist, Tomas, a brilliant Prague surgeon, pursues a philosophy of lightness in his erotic adventures and exploits. Briefly married in the past, he neither sees nor wishes to see his ex-wife or young son and is comfortably established as a perpetual bachelor. He meets Tereza, a café waitress in a town he visits, and realizes when she follows him to Prague that she intends to ""offer him up her life."" A determined libertine, he momentarily resists his budding roma ntic feelings for her, then gives in to his love.
Tereza had been living a frustrated life as a waitress in a small town, and dreamed of escaping, especially from her vulgar mother. She recognizes in Tomas an intellectual and dreamer, and falls in love with him instantly. The two live together, but Tomas is unable to give up his mistresses. For a while he hides his infidelity from Teresa. Eventually he admits to it, but claims that his sexuality is entirely separate from his love for her. Tereza, unable to accept his behavior or adopt a light attitud e towards sex, suffers increasingly from nightmares, and contemplates suicide.
To keep Tereza happy, Tomas marries her. He keeps his mistresses, however, including his closest friend and long-term lover Sabina, a beautiful, reckless, and talented painter. In spite of herself, Tereza is charmed by Sabina's openness and light-heartedness, and the two women grow friendly. Sabina finds Tereza a job in Prague as a photographer. Despite her friendship with Sabina, however, Tereza's jealousy of Tomas does not slacken.
The events of the Prague Spring result in the Soviet military occupation of the city. Tomas, who in the past wrote an article condemning the Czech Communists, is warned to leave. Sabina flees first, and later Tomas and Tereza join her in Switzerland. Tereza, who found some fulfillment in her job as photographer in Prague, realizes that in Zurich she is jobless and must sit at home while Tomas continues having affairs. She decides that ""when the strong were too weak to hurt the weak, the weak had to be strong enough to leave,"" and returns to Prague. Tomas attempts to enjoy his newly recovered freedom for a few days, then gives up and returns to Prague and Tereza. The return truly means giving up freedom—there is no chance that the couple will be allo wed to leave again. In Prague, Tomas's political troubles escalate. He loses his position as surgeon for refusing to sign a denunciation of his anti-Communist article. Both the Communist regime and underground dissidents attempt to seduce him to their side. His own son reappears as a young dissident and preaches to Tomas with no success, for Tomas hates the idea of being used politically in the same way Sabina hates artistic kitsch. In the end, Tomas seeks obscurity in a job washing windows. His fame persists, however, and he continues seducing the women he works for.
Tereza, now a bartender, in a moment of desperation has an affair with a tall engineer who comes to her bar. She does so in hopes of coming closer to Tomas's way of life; instead she grows more miserable and becomes convinced the man was a police agent hired to gather potential blackmailing material. After many scenes and nightmares, she convinces Tomas to move with her to the country. This means giving up their way of life entirely, and an end to Tomas's erotic adventures.
After living peacefully in the country for some time, Tomas and Tereza are killed one night in a driving accident; they die instantly and together.
In Geneva, Sabina has a love affair with Franz, a university professor and idealistic intellectual who has more in common emotionally with Tereza than Sabina—he imbues his life with heavy meaning. He views Sabina as a romantic and courageous Czech dissident, and is tortured that he must betray his wife Marie-Claude in order to see her. Sabina loves Franz but their views on betrayal differ dramatically; whereas he hates the idea of betrayal, she views betrayal as the first step towards ""going off into the unknown,"" the most glorious thing she can think of.
When Franz leaves his wife and expects to move in with her, Sabina abruptly leaves Switzerland. Sabina leaves Geneva for Paris and then Paris for America; she learns of Tomas and Tereza's deaths from a letter and understands her last link to the past has been broken. She ends up living with an elderly American couple and wondering if she has reached the end of her perpetual flight.
Franz remains separated from his wife. After Sabina's betrayal, he finds consolation with a young student, a girl in over-sized glasses who loves him simply. Franz never accepts that he clearly misunderstood Sabina, but continues to hold her image as in ideal in his head, (wrongly) thinking his decisions in life would have made her proud. At his death, his wife reclaims Franz's body and orders the words ""A return after long wanderings"" written on his tombstone."
General,"Jack Worthing, the play’s protagonist, is a pillar of the community in Hertfordshire, where he is guardian to Cecily Cardew, the pretty, eighteen-year-old granddaughter of the late Thomas Cardew, who found and adopted Jack when he was a baby. In Hertfordshire, Jack has responsibilities: he is a major landowner and justice of the peace, with tenants, farmers, and a number of servants and other employees all dependent on him. For years, he has also pretended to have an irresponsible black-sheep brother named Ernest who leads a scandalous life in pursuit of pleasure and is always getting into trouble of a sort that requires Jack to rush grimly off to his assistance. In fact, Ernest is merely Jack’s alibi, a phantom that allows him to disappear for days at a time and do as he likes. No one but Jack knows that he himself is Ernest. Ernest is the name Jack goes by in London, which is where he really goes on these occasions—probably to pursue the very sort of behavior he pretends to disapprove of in his imaginary brother.
Jack is in love with Gwendolen Fairfax, the cousin of his best friend, Algernon Moncrieff. When the play opens, Algernon, who knows Jack as Ernest, has begun to suspect something, having found an inscription inside Jack’s cigarette case addressed to “Uncle Jack” from someone who refers to herself as “little Cecily.” Algernon suspects that Jack may be leading a double life, a practice he seems to regard as commonplace and indispensable to modern life. He calls a person who leads a double life a “Bunburyist,” after a nonexistent friend he pretends to have, a chronic invalid named Bunbury, to whose deathbed he is forever being summoned whenever he wants to get out of some tiresome social obligation.
At the beginning of Act 1, Jack drops in unexpectedly on Algernon and announces that he intends to propose to Gwendolen. Algernon confronts him with the cigarette case and forces him to come clean, demanding to know who “Jack” and “Cecily” are. Jack confesses that his name isn’t really Ernest and that Cecily is his ward, a responsibility imposed on him by his adoptive father’s will. Jack also tells Algernon about his fictional brother. Jack says he’s been thinking of killing off this fake brother, since Cecily has been showing too active an interest in him. Without meaning to, Jack describes Cecily in terms that catch Algernon’s attention and make him even more interested in her than he is already.
Gwendolen and her mother, Lady Bracknell, arrive, which gives Jack an opportunity to propose to Gwendolen. Jack is delighted to discover that Gwendolen returns his affections, but he is alarmed to learn that Gwendolen is fixated on the name Ernest, which she says “inspires absolute confidence.” Gwendolen makes clear that she would not consider marrying a man who was not named Ernest.
Lady Bracknell interviews Jack to determine his eligibility as a possible son-in-law, and during this interview she asks about his family background. When Jack explains that he has no idea who his parents were and that he was found, by the man who adopted him, in a handbag in the cloakroom at Victoria Station, Lady Bracknell is scandalized. She forbids the match between Jack and Gwendolen and sweeps out of the house.
In Act 2, Algernon shows up at Jack’s country estate posing as Jack’s brother Ernest. Meanwhile, Jack, having decided that Ernest has outlived his usefulness, arrives home in deep mourning, full of a story about Ernest having died suddenly in Paris. He is enraged to find Algernon there masquerading as Ernest but has to go along with the charade. If he doesn’t, his own lies and deceptions will be revealed.
While Jack changes out of his mourning clothes, Algernon, who has fallen hopelessly in love with Cecily, asks her to marry him. He is surprised to discover that Cecily already considers that they are engaged, and he is charmed when she reveals that her fascination with “Uncle Jack’s brother” led her to invent an elaborate romance between herself and him several months ago. Algernon is less enchanted to learn that part of Cecily’s interest in him derives from the name Ernest, which, unconsciously echoing Gwendolen, she says “inspires absolute confidence.”
Algernon goes off in search of Dr. Chasuble, the local rector, to see about getting himself christened Ernest. Meanwhile, Gwendolen arrives, having decided to pay Jack an unexpected visit. Gwendolen is shown into the garden, where Cecily orders tea and attempts to play hostess. Cecily has no idea how Gwendolen figures into Jack’s life, and Gwendolen, for her part, has no idea who Cecily is. Gwendolen initially thinks Cecily is a visitor to the Manor House and is disconcerted to learn that Cecily is “Mr. Worthing’s ward.” She notes that Ernest has never mentioned having a ward, and Cecily explains that it is not Ernest Worthing who is her guardian but his brother Jack and, in fact, that she is engaged to be married to Ernest Worthing. Gwendolen points out that this is impossible as she herself is engaged to Ernest Worthing. The tea party degenerates into a war of manners.
Jack and Algernon arrive toward the climax of this confrontation, each having separately made arrangements with Dr. Chasuble to be christened Ernest later that day. Each of the young ladies points out that the other has been deceived: Cecily informs Gwendolen that her fiancé is really named Jack and Gwendolen informs Cecily that hers is really called Algernon. The two women demand to know where Jack’s brother Ernest is, since both of them are engaged to be married to him. Jack is forced to admit that he has no brother and that Ernest is a complete fiction. Both women are shocked and furious, and they retire to the house arm in arm.
Act 3 takes place in the drawing room of the Manor House, where Cecily and Gwendolen have retired. When Jack and Algernon enter from the garden, the two women confront them. Cecily asks Algernon why he pretended to be her guardian’s brother. Algernon tells her he did it in order to meet her. Gwendolen asks Jack whether he pretended to have a brother in order to come into London to see her as often as possible, and she interprets his evasive reply as an affirmation. The women are somewhat appeased but still concerned over the issue of the name. However, when Jack and Algernon tell Gwendolen and Cecily that they have both made arrangements to be christened Ernest that afternoon, all is forgiven and the two pairs of lovers embrace. At this moment, Lady Bracknell’s arrival is announced.
Lady Bracknell has followed Gwendolen from London, having bribed Gwendolen’s maid to reveal her destination. She demands to know what is going on. Gwendolen again informs Lady Bracknell of her engagement to Jack, and Lady Bracknell reiterates that a union between them is out of the question. Algernon tells Lady Bracknell of his engagement to Cecily, prompting her to inspect Cecily and inquire into her social connections, which she does in a routine and patronizing manner that infuriates Jack. He replies to all her questions with a mixture of civility and sarcasm, withholding until the last possible moment the information that Cecily is actually worth a great deal of money and stands to inherit still more when she comes of age. At this, Lady Bracknell becomes genuinely interested.
Jack informs Lady Bracknell that, as Cecily’s legal guardian, he refuses to give his consent to her union with Algernon. Lady Bracknell suggests that the two young people simply wait until Cecily comes of age, and Jack points out that under the terms of her grandfather’s will, Cecily does not legally come of age until she is thirty-five. Lady Bracknell asks Jack to reconsider, and he points out that the matter is entirely in her own hands. As soon as she consents to his marriage to Gwendolen, Cecily can have his consent to marry Algernon. However, Lady Bracknell refuses to entertain the notion. She and Gwendolen are on the point of leaving when Dr. Chasuble arrives and happens to mention Cecily’s governess, Miss Prism. At this, Lady Bracknell starts and asks that Miss Prism be sent for.
When the governess arrives and catches sight of Lady Bracknell, she begins to look guilty and furtive. Lady Bracknell accuses her of having left her sister’s house twenty-eight years before with a baby and never returned. She demands to know where the baby is. Miss Prism confesses she doesn’t know, explaining that she lost the baby, having absentmindedly placed it in a handbag in which she had meant to place the manuscript for a novel she had written. Jack asks what happened to the bag, and Miss Prism says she left it in the cloakroom of a railway station. Jack presses her for further details and goes racing offstage, returning a few moments later with a large handbag. When Miss Prism confirms that the bag is hers, Jack throws himself on her with a cry of “Mother!” It takes a while before the situation is sorted out, but before too long we understand that Jack is not the illegitimate child of Miss Prism but the legitimate child of Lady Bracknell’s sister and, therefore, Algernon’s older brother. Furthermore, Jack had been originally christened “Ernest John.” All these years Jack has unwittingly been telling the truth: Ernest is his name, as is Jack, and he does have an unprincipled younger brother—Algernon. Again the couples embrace, Miss Prism and Dr. Chasuble follow suit, and Jack acknowledges that he now understands “the vital Importance of Being Earnest.”"
Looked,"Julian West, the narrator of Looking Backward, was born into an aristocratic family in the late nineteenth century. The gap between the rich and poor was vast and seemingly impossible to remedy through any means. Like other members of his class, Julian thought himself superior to the toiling masses, and he regarded their frequent strikes with anger and contempt. Julian was engaged to Edith Bartlett, a beautiful, graceful Boston aristocrat. They planned to marry when the construction of their new home was completed, but the frequent strikes by the building trades had delayed their marriage for over a year.
Julian, a sufferer of insomnia, had secretly built an underground sleeping chamber to shield himself from street noises. He also enlisted the aid of Doctor Pillsbury, a skilled mesmerist, who never failed to leave Julian in a deep sleep. Pillsbury trained Julian's servant, Sawyer, to revive Julian from a mesmerized sleep. The night before Pillsbury left Boston for a new job in New Orleans, Julian enlisted his help one last time. After Pillsbury left, Julian's home was destroyed by a fire; Julian was protected by his underground chamber. Because no one knew of his chamber, Julian was assumed dead.
Over one hundred years later, Julian's secret chamber is discovered by Doctor Leete, who was preparing the site for the construction of a new laboratory. Julian has not aged a day because he has been in a state of suspended animation. Doctor Leete revives him and takes him into his home. Julian quickly learns that twentieth-century society is vastly different from that of the nineteenth century. The economy is based on publicly owned capital rather than private, as was the case in Julian's day. The government controls the means of production and divides the national product equally between all citizens. Every citizen receives a college-level education. Individuals are given a great deal of freedom in choosing a career, and everyone retires at the age of forty-five. Society is based on an ideal of the brotherhood of man, and it is unthinkable that any individual should suffer the evils of poverty or hunger. With Doctor Leete's guidance, Julian comes to understand and appreciate the twentieth-century society. Meanwhile, Julian learns that Doctor Leete's daughter, Edith is the great-granddaughter of Edith Bartlett. Julian and Edith become engaged, much to Doctor Leete's pleasure.
Julian has a terrible nightmare, in which he dreams that his transportation to the twentieth century was nothing but a dream. He finds himself trapped again in the cruel and inhumane world of the nineteenth century. To his great distress, he now sees all of the horrendous faults of nineteenth-century society. He tries to explain to his friends--Edith Bartlett and her family-- why their society is so awful and cruel, and how it can be transformed into something much better. However, they are only frightened and angered, so they expel Julian from their company. When Julian wakes from this nightmare to discover that his trip to the twentieth century was not just a dream, he is greatly relieved."
Applies,"The Other Wes Moore: One Name, Two Fates tells the story of two Black men with the same name: Wes Moore. Both men grew up enduring similar hardships, but Moore, the author and narrator, was encouraged to overcome these difficulties and became successful, while Wes, his counterpart, found himself sentenced to life in prison for murder. Moore learns about Wes and, fascinated, writes him a letter, hoping to find out more about what led Wes to a life of incarceration. Moore receives a response from Wes and begins to visit him in prison, where the two share their stories.
In the first section of the book, the two men discuss the impact that the absence of their fathers had on their lives, and their stories alternate in each chapter. Moore introduces his mother, Joy; father, Westley; and sisters, Nikki and Shani. He details how his parents met and describes his father’s job as a radio journalist. When Moore was three years old, he watched his father become sick and die in front of him. 
Meanwhile, young Wes has never met his father, Bernard, who was an alcoholic, but loved spending time with his father’s mother, Mamie. One day, Wes’s mother, Mary, learns that her funding to go to college has been taken away, and her dream to get her degree crumbles. That night, Mary has plans with friends, so she drops young Wes off at Mamie’s for the night. When Wes arrives at Mamie’s, he sees a drunk man—Bernard—on Mamie’s couch. When Bernard asks Mary who the kid is, Mary introduces Wes to his father.
Several years later, Wes and his friend Woody go the park, where they meet up with a group of boys to play football. The game turns aggressive, and another boy punches Wes. Wes runs home and grabs a knife. He returns to the park and runs after the boy, but the police arrive and arrest Wes. He is eight years old. 
Around this time, Moore’s widowed mother, Joy, unable to raise her children alone any longer, has moved her family to the Bronx to live with her parents. To keep Moore off the street, she sends Moore to Riverdale, a private school. She works three jobs to pay the tuition. Moore feels alienated. He doesn’t fit in at Riverdale, and the neighborhood kids tease him for attending a white school. When Moore’s grades slip, Joy threatens to send him to military school. 
Wes admires and envies his older brother Tony. Tony is very protective of Wes. Tony deals drugs, has a formidable reputation, and always seems to wear expensive, stylish clothes. Hoping to earn money like Tony, Wes becomes a lookout for a local drug dealer. He later starts dealing drugs himself.
In the next section of the book, Moore and Wes discuss maturity and second chances. Once again, their stories alternate in each chapter. At age fifteen, Wes makes his money selling drugs. When Tony asks Wes how he can afford so many pairs of sneakers, Wes lies and says he works as a DJ. Tony knows he’s being dishonest, attacks him, and then tells Mary that Wes sells drugs. Mary finds drugs in Wes’s room and flushes them down the toilet. Wes feels angry about the situation but vows to make up the $4,000 he lost. 
In the Bronx, Moore continues to do poorly in school. The police catch him tagging a building with his friend Shea, who has started running drugs. Shea is obstinate toward the police, but Moore feels terrified. The police let the boys off with a warning. A year later, Moore finds himself on academic probation at Riverdale, so Joy sends him to military school. At first, Moore displays an attitude and defies his commander, Sergeant Anderson. At one point, Anderson gives Moore a map with directions to the nearest bus station, encouraging Moore to leave. The directions are fake, however, and Moore becomes lost in the woods. When Anderson finds Moore in the woods, he brings him to Colonel Batt, who allows Moore to call home for five minutes. The next day, Moore is impressed by the discipline of F Company, and Colonel Batt suggests he talks to its commander, Cadet Captain Ty Hill.
In Maryland, Wes meets Alicia, who quickly becomes pregnant. Wes soon begins dating a new girl, however, and one night, as the girl leaves Wes’s apartment, her boyfriend, Ray, is waiting outside. Ray yells at the girl and attacks Wes, who runs inside and grabs a gun. Wes and some of his crew chase Ray and shoot him. Wes is arrested soon after. He spends six months in juvenile detention for the crime.
Three years later, Wes has dropped out of school and is selling drugs full-time. One day, a suspicious man approaches Wes, asking for drugs. Wes turns the man away at first but then decides to take a chance. However, the man is an undercover cop, and Wes is arrested again. 
Meanwhile, Moore thrives in military school, where he wins academic and athletic scholarships. One day, Moore and a friend walk into town for food. While they are walking, a group of boys in a car accost them, shout racial slurs, and hit Moore in the head with a bottle. Moore and his friend find their way back to campus through the same woods where Moore once got lost. He reflects on how much has changed for him over the past few years.
In the third section of the book, Moore and Wes discuss how other people’s expectations have shaped their lives. While in a plane during his paratrooper training, Moore contemplates how much his life has changed and considers how he now sees every moment of life as precious. 
In Baltimore, Wes, now the father of four, tries to change his life and goes to Job Corps for vocational training. There, he is encouraged by his teachers and peers and finds success. However, after graduating, Wes struggles to pay his bills and turns to selling drugs again.
Three years later, Wes and Tony rob a jewelry store. As they escape, one of them shoots and kills the security guard, Sergeant Prothero. The police find and arrest them in Philadelphia. Tony pleads guilty and receives a life sentence. Wes pleads innocent and goes to trial, where he is convicted and also sentenced to life in prison. 
During this time, Moore works as an intern for Baltimore’s Mayor Schmoke, who encourages Moore to apply for a Rhodes Scholarship. Moore receives a grant and spends a semester in South Africa, where he witnesses true poverty and the impact of apartheid. At the same time, Moore learns how young Black men in South Africa are encouraged and celebrated, rather than feared, and decides to dedicate himself to a life of service."
Recollected,"As A Clash of Kings begins, the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros are locked in a bloody civil war. Joff Lannister, who is still a young boy, has recently become king, but Stannis Baratheon and Renly Baratheon both want the crown for themselves. Robb Stark, meanwhile, has recently taken the title of King of the North. Far to the north of this action, the men of the Night’s Watch leave the safety of the Wall to investigate the disappearance of the wilding people, enemies who live in primitive bands and villages in the vast wilderness north of the Wall. Meanwhile, across the narrow sea, Daenerys Targaryen leads her beleaguered band of Dothrakis in search of enough wealth and soldiers to return to Westeros and capture the Iron Throne. Simultaneous developments within these three plots constitute the major action of the novel.
Robb Stark, King of the North, tries to secure an alliance with the Greyjoys of the Iron Islands by sending Theon Greyjoy, a ward of the Stark family who has been like a brother to Robb, to negotiate. Theon, however, turns against the Starks, who kept him at Winterfell against his will, and the Greyjoys not only rebuff Robb’s offer but attack the west coast of the North. At Winterfell, young Bran Stark chafes as he is left in charge. In his dreams, he inhabits the body of his direwolf, Summer. Jojen and Meera Reed arrive at Winterfell, and the three bond over Jojen and Bran’s supernatural powers. Vainglorious Theon then attacks Winterfell, seizing Bran and Rickon as hostages. He pretends to kill Bran and Rickon, which disgusts everyone. Theon lacks men and enters into an alliance with a group led by Ramsay Bolton. This group turns on Theon, takes him captive, and decimates Winterfell. Bran, Hodor, and the Reeds escape Winterfell and head to the Wall, where Jojen will continue Bran’s mystical training. Osha takes Rickon south.
Stannis Baratheon, older brother of Robert, declares himself the rightful heir to the Iron Throne. With the support of Melisandre, a red priestess, he attacks his brother Renly, who has also declared himself king. Catelyn Stark arrives at Storm’s End to broker a truce between Stannis and Renly, but instead she witnesses the death of Renly at the hands of a mysterious shadow. She flees with Brienne of Tarth, a female knight who was part of Renly's guard. Storm’s End finally falls after Ser Davos takes Melisandre below the castle at night, where he watches her give birth to a shadow assassin much like the one Catelyn saw. Catelyn returns to Riverrun to tend to her dying father, Lord Hoster Tully. Hearing of the supposed deaths of Bran and Rickon, Catelyn goes to the dungeon to question Jaime Lannister, a skilled knight whom Robb Stark captured in battle in the previous novel.
Tyrion arrives at King’s Landing to act as Hand on behalf of his father, Lord Tywin Lannister. Against his father’s wishes, he has brought his prostitute lover, Shae. While Tyrion feels some loyalty to House Lannister, he mistrusts his sister, Cersei, and wants to see justice prevail. He fortifies the city, forging alliances with two powerful members of the royal council, Littlefinger and Varys, and banishing, killing, or imprisoning those who have committed crimes, even if said crimes were committed at Cersei’s behest. Stannis leads a massive attack against King's Landing and the Lannisters by land and sea in an effort to take the throne by force. He loses, thanks to Tyrion’s cunning and foresight and the surprise arrival of Tywin’s army. During this battle, Ser Mandon Moore attempts to assassinate Tyrion, who is saved by his squire, Podrick Payne.
Posing as a boy, Arya Stark travels north to the Wall with Yoren, a recruiter for the Night’s Watch. A vicious attack kills Yoren, but Arya escapes with her friends Gendry, Hot Pie, and Lommy Greenhands. In the process, she saves the lives of three criminals, including a man from Braavos named Jaqen H’ghar. Neither Arya nor Gendry knows, but Gendry is actually the bastard son of Robert Baratheon, who was king before Joff Lannister. Arya and her friends are captured and taken to Harrenhal to work as servants. Jaqen arrives at Harrenhal as part of a group called the Brave Companions. When he spots Arya, he promises to kill any three people Arya names in return for her saving his life and the lives of his friends. Arya has Jaqen kill two people, then forces Jaqen to help her free a group of Northmen who she believes will help her return to Winterfell. Impressed by her cunning, Jaqen gives her a coin and tells her she can always get help from a Braavosi fighter if she repeats a certain phrase he teaches her. Arya again escapes with Gendry and Hot Pie.
Meanwhile, a group of men from the Night’s Watch leave the Wall and travel into the mysterious woods to the north. They spend the night at Craster’s Keep, where Craster reveals that Mance Rayder is gathering all the wildings. They continue moving north, camping at the Fist of the First Men. Jeor Mormont sends Jon Snow and Qhorin Halfhand as reconnaissance scouts. The pair discover that the wildings are moving. Jon has a dream in which he becomes Ghost, his direwolf. Later, the events of the dream come true, implying that Jon, like his half-brother Bran, is a warg (skinchanger). Qhorin commands Jon to pretend to give up the Night's Watch and join the wildlings if they are captured, but to secretly keep gathering information. When the wildlings take Jon and Qhorin, they make the two fight to the death, and deliberately allows Jon to kill him to convince the wildlings that Jon truly means to abandon the Watch.
In the lands across the narrow sea, Daenerys Targaryen struggles. After the death of her Dothraki husband, a powerful warlord, her Dothraki following dwindled. She roams the Red Waste with a small, loyal band, including her handmaids, her bloodriders, and Ser Jorah Mormont. Her three dragons continue to grow. For a time, they camp at an abandoned city, but eventually they continue to Qarth. Although the Qartheen are intrigued by her dragons, they will not help Daenerys raise an army to capture her rightful throne or fund her crossing of the narrow sea. She is told to seek answers at the House of the Undying Ones, where she is beset by disturbing visions. One of her dragons burns it down, which angers the Qartheen. Daenerys is saved from an assassination attempt by two strangers, Strong Belwas and Arstan Whitebeard. Acting on behalf of Illyrio Mopatis, they have arrived to take Daenerys back to Pentos. She agrees."
Sing,"The body of Chase Andrews is found by two boys next to an abandoned fire tower in the swamp on October 30, 1969.
In 1952, six-year-old Kya watches her mother leave their shack in the marsh. Before long, her siblings, including her beloved 12-year-old brother Jodie, depart too, leaving Kya alone with Pa, a drunken, disabled World War II vet prone to violent rages. Pa gives Kya a dollar a week for food. In town, older boys, including Chase Andrews, pass her on their bikes. Kya spends most of her time in the marsh with the gulls.
Mrs. Culpepper, a truant officer, takes Kya to school, where she is humiliated and never returns. Over the years, townspeople call her “dirty,” “the Marsh Girl,” “Missing Link,” and “marsh trash.”
Kya takes Pa’s fishing boat exploring. When she gets lost, one of Jodie’s friends, Tate Walker, guides her back to her channel. Tate lives alone in town with his dad, Scupper, a fisherman. 
For a while, Kya and Pa fish together and enjoy each other’s company. Pa introduces Kya to Jumpin’, an older Black man who sells gas and supplies. Kya’s mother sends a letter, but Pa burns it and returns to drinking. Pa finally disappears when Kya is ten years old. Kya supports herself selling mussels to Jumpin’, whose wife Mabel collects clothes for Kya from Colored Town. Kya continues watching Tate as well as Chase and his friends.
When she is 14 years old, Kya finds a series of special feathers left in a tree stump in the marsh. One day, she leaves a special feather in return. After that, Tate appears at the stump and offers to teach her to read. Tate and Kya begin to meet at a secret cabin in the marsh where he teaches her to read. As Kya matures, Tate brings her a biology textbook and Mabel gives her a bra. One day Tate finds Kya sick on Point Beach. He explains to her that she is having her period. Kya and Tate continue their lessons and she invites him inside her shack and shows him her collection of natural objects. One day, Tate kisses Kya and they begin a romantic relationship. Their desire grows but they avoid having sex. Tate leaves early for college and tells Kya he will visit on the 4th of July. However, he doesn’t return. Kya, devastated, returns to studying nature.
When Kya is 19 years old, Chase catches her eye on Point Beach. He is a popular, good looking, confident, former high school quarterback. Chase approaches Kya on Jumpin’s wharf and invites her on a picnic. 
At the picnic, Chase gives Kya a rare scallop shell. He is sexually aggressive and she runs away. When Kya and Chase meet ten days later, he apologizes and takes her to see the abandoned fire tower. Kya gives Chase a necklace made from the scallop shell. Chase says he won’t approach her sexually unless she wants him to.
Kya gets closer to Chase. Tate, who is home from college, wants to apologize to Kya, but sees her kissing Chase and turns away. Chase starts talking about marriage and invites Kya on an overnight trip. She joins him and they have unsatisfying sex in a cheap motel room. Still, their relationship continues. However, Chase won’t introduce Kya to his parents or friends and disappears for a week over Christmas. 
Tate comes to the lagoon to warn Kya that Chase is seeing other women, but she throws rocks at him. Still, she invites him into the shack and he offers to find a publisher for a book of her nature paintings. 
Kya sees the engagement announcement in the newspaper for Chase and Pearl, a girl she recognizes from Point Beach. She recites poems by Amanda Hamilton, who publishes in the local newspaper, to soothe herself. She determines to live her life alone.
A year later, Kya receives a copy of her first book. She uses the advance money to improve and modernize the shack. She gives Tate a copy of her book. 
Kya’s brother Jodie visits the shack. He tells her that Ma has died and promises to keep in touch. He encourages her to reconcile with Tate.
In August of 1969, Chase sneaks up on Kya on a remote beach, attacks and tries to rape her. She fights him off and sees two fishermen watching from their boat as she leaves. Tate and Jumpin’ see her bruises, but she begs them not to tell anyone. Chase continues to come to her shack, but she hides from him. Kya gets a letter from her publisher, Robert Foster, to meet him in Greenville. She finds out from Tate how to buy a bus ticket and goes to meet him on October 28, returning on October 30, the day Chase’s body is found.
Sheriff Ed Jackson and his deputy Joe Perdue investigate Chase’s death. No footprints or fingerprints are found at the scene. They think Chase was pushed through an open gate and the murderer covered up the scene. Almost immediately, everyone in town suspects “the Marsh Girl.” 
Over time, Joe and Ed’s main clue consists of red wool fibers on Chase’s jacket. Also, Chase’s mother Patti Love tells them Chase was wearing the shell necklace when he left her house that night, but it was not found at the scene. A shrimper, Hal Miller, tells them he saw Kya’s boat headed toward the fire tower the night Chase died. However, Tate and Jumpin’ and townspeople who saw her get on and off the bus to Greenville give Kya an alibi. A fisherman, Rodney Horn, who heard Kya yelling and saw her leaving after Chase attacked her, heard her say she would kill Chase if he bothered her again. Joe and Ed find a red wool hat in Kya’s shack that Tate gave her and that matches the fibers on Chase’s coat. With this information, they arrest Kya for murder.
Kya spends two months in jail awaiting trial. A lawyer, Tom Milton, volunteers to defend her. 
A kind guard at the prison, Jacob, lets the cat, Sunday Justice, into her cell for company. Tate, Jumpin’, and Mabel sit behind Kya in court for support. They are later joined by Jodie, Robert Foster, and Scupper. 
Prosecutor Eric Chastain calls his witnesses and Tom Milton counters their testimony. The jury learns that it would have been possible for Kya to take buses back and forth from Greenville on the night of the murder, but the timing is very tight. Tom calls defense witnesses, including Kya’s publisher Robert Foster. After closing statements, everyone awaits the verdict. Kya is found not guilty. Jodie takes her home, where she is delighted to see the marsh again. 
Kya sees Tate in his boat and is going to approach him, but the sheriff and two deputies arrive and take Tate with them. She learns that Scupper has had a stroke and died.
The day after Scupper’s funeral, Tate finds a feather in his boat from Kya. At the shack, they express their love for each other and Tate moves in with her. Over the years, Jumpin’ dies, and Jodie and his wife and children visit the shack. Tate works at the nearby lab and Kya writes seven more books. 
One day Tate finds Kya in her boat, dead of a heart attack at age 64. On her tombstone, he inscribes “The Marsh Girl.” Many townspeople come to Kya’s funeral on her land. That night, Tate finds two items beneath the floorboards. One is a box of poems by Amanda Hamilton, a pseudonym Kya used, including a poem describing Chase Andrews’ death. Tate also finds the shell necklace Kya gave Chase. Tate burns the poems and rawhide cord and crushes the shell on the beach for the tide to take away."
Proceeding,"In the Puritan New England town of Salem, Massachusetts, a group of girls goes dancing in the forest with a black slave named Tituba. While dancing, they are caught by the local minister, Reverend Parris. One of the girls, Parris’s daughter Betty, falls into a coma-like state. A crowd gathers in the Parris home while rumors of witchcraft fill the town. Having sent for Reverend Hale, an expert on witchcraft, Parris questions Abigail Williams, the girls’ ringleader, about the events that took place in the forest. Abigail, who is Parris’s niece and ward, admits to doing nothing beyond “dancing.”
While Parris tries to calm the crowd that has gathered in his home, Abigail talks to some of the other girls, telling them not to admit to anything. John Proctor, a local farmer, then enters and talks to Abigail alone. Unbeknownst to anyone else in the town, while working in Proctor’s home the previous year she engaged in an affair with him, which led to her being fired by his wife, Elizabeth. Abigail still desires Proctor, but he fends her off and tells her to end her foolishness with the girls.
Betty wakes up and begins screaming. Much of the crowd rushes upstairs and gathers in her bedroom, arguing over whether she is bewitched. A separate argument between Proctor, Parris, the argumentative Giles Corey, and the wealthy Thomas Putnam soon ensues. This dispute centers on money and land deeds, and it suggests that deep fault lines run through the Salem community. As the men argue, Reverend Hale arrives and examines Betty, while Proctor departs. Hale quizzes Abigail about the girls’ activities in the forest, grows suspicious of her behavior, and demands to speak to Tituba. After Parris and Hale interrogate her for a brief time, Tituba confesses to communing with the devil, and she hysterically accuses various townsfolk of consorting with the devil. Suddenly, Abigail joins her, confessing to having seen the devil conspiring and cavorting with other townspeople. Betty joins them in naming witches, and the crowd is thrown into an uproar.
A week later, alone in their farmhouse outside of town, John and Elizabeth Proctor discuss the ongoing trials and the escalating number of townsfolk who have been accused of being witches. Elizabeth urges her husband to denounce Abigail as a fraud; he refuses, and she becomes jealous, accusing him of still harboring feelings for her. Mary Warren, their servant and one of Abigail’s circle, returns from Salem with news that Elizabeth has been accused of witchcraft but the court did not pursue the accusation. Mary is sent up to bed, and John and Elizabeth continue their argument, only to be interrupted by a visit from Reverend Hale. While they discuss matters, Giles Corey and Francis Nurse come to the Proctor home with news that their wives have been arrested. Officers of the court suddenly arrive and arrest Elizabeth. After they have taken her, Proctor browbeats Mary, insisting that she must go to Salem and expose Abigail and the other girls as frauds.
The next day, Proctor brings Mary to court and tells Judge Danforth that she will testify that the girls are lying. Danforth is suspicious of Proctor’s motives and tells Proctor, truthfully, that Elizabeth is pregnant and will be spared for a time. Proctor persists in his charge, convincing Danforth to allow Mary to testify. Mary tells the court that the girls are lying. When the girls are brought in, they turn the tables by accusing Mary of bewitching them. Furious, Proctor confesses his affair with Abigail and accuses her of being motivated by jealousy of his wife. To test Proctor’s claim, Danforth summons Elizabeth and asks her if Proctor has been unfaithful to her. Despite her natural honesty, she lies to protect Proctor’s honor, and Danforth denounces Proctor as a liar. Meanwhile, Abigail and the girls again pretend that Mary is bewitching them, and Mary breaks down and accuses Proctor of being a witch. Proctor rages against her and against the court. He is arrested, and Hale quits the proceedings.
The summer passes and autumn arrives. The witch trials have caused unrest in neighboring towns, and Danforth grows nervous. Abigail has run away, taking all of Parris’s money with her. Hale, who has lost faith in the court, begs the accused witches to confess falsely in order to save their lives, but they refuse. Danforth, however, has an idea: he asks Elizabeth to talk John into confessing, and she agrees. Conflicted, but desiring to live, John agrees to confess, and the officers of the court rejoice. But he refuses to incriminate anyone else, and when the court insists that the confession must be made public, Proctor grows angry, tears it up, and retracts his admission of guilt. Despite Hale’s desperate pleas, Proctor goes to the gallows with the others, and the witch trials reach their awful conclusion."
Corroded,"Tally Youngblood is living in a dorm in Uglyville, just outside of Pretty Town, where her best friend, Peris, has just moved. Peris just had the city’s mandatory cosmetic surgery to become a “Pretty” and is now living with the other Pretties across the river. Tally is still an “Ugly,” but she is only months away from her surgery. She can’t wait to become a Pretty. Tally believes that, after the surgery, she’ll finally be at peace with herself and will be once again reunited with her best friend.
Tally decides to go on a secret mission to visit Peris. Uglies are not allowed in Pretty Town, so Tally picks up a disguise from a passing parade as she makes her way to Pretty Town. Everyone in Pretty Town parties night and day, and this day is no different. Tally watches as the revelers drink and bungee jump off the two Party Towers that flank Garbo Mansion, where Peris lives. As Tally makes her way through the party, the revelers catch onto her and chase her. She finds Peris in an elevator, who encourages her to bungee jump off the tower to escape. Before Tally leaps, Peris makes her promise not to come back. He doesn’t want her to hurt her chances of getting surgery.
Tally finds another girl on a similar mission, Shay, hiding in the bushes. Shay and Tally strike up a friendship after Shay becomes impressed with Tally’s daredevil antics. They discover they have the same birthday. It seems no one returns to Uglyville after the surgery. Both Tally and Shay wonder why their friends don’t seem to want to contact them anymore once they move. They pledge to remain friends after the surgery.
Shay shows Tally how to use a hoverboard, a flying device that uses magnetization to stay airborne. They decide to do tricks and play games as a last hurrah before heading off to surgery. Shay isn’t as excited about the surgery as Tally. She resists the idea that people aren’t beautiful without the surgery. Shay says she accepts her features and wishes Tally did, too. The night before their surgery, Shay comes to Tally’s room and offers her an opportunity to escape. She says there is a place beyond the Rusty Ruins, the ruins of a prior civilization that went extinct after it became too dependent on oil, where people live without the surgery. Tally politely refuses the offer, thinking Shay is crazy to avoid a life where she could have no worries and be beautiful. 
On the day of Tally’s surgery, the city’s secret police organization, Special Circumstances, comes to pick her up. They tell her there is a problem with her surgery. Tally meets Dr. Cable, a terrifyingly beautiful operative. Dr. Cable says they have been after Tally’s friend Shay for months. They want to know where Shay is headed and want to seize the other runaways. Dr. Cable gives Tally an ultimatum: Help infiltrate the runaways’ camp, or be denied “Pretty” surgery. Tally, overwhelmed by the idea of a lifetime of ugliness and lack of acceptance, reluctantly agrees.
Tally must make the two-week trek to the camp, called the Smoke, alone. She uses Shay’s secret coded instructions to get there. Tally almost drowns in a river after a group of rangers riding a helicopter blow her hoverboard into the river. The rangers are Pretties who are hired to spread fires to kill a highly invasive species of white orchid that was genetically engineered by the Rusties, people who lived during the Rusty Era. They take Tally to the edge of a field and leave her there for the Smokies to pick her up.
Tally is relieved to find her friend Shay alive and well. Dr. Cable has outfitted Tally with a special locket she has to activate with her eye when she’s ready to call in the forces. After meeting David, one of the camp’s leaders, and seeing how the Smokies have an entire way of life, Tally struggles with whether to turn Shay in. David, seeing how serious Tally takes leaving her life behind, takes her to meet his parents, Az and Maddy, who are doctors that used to perform Pretty surgeries on people. Az and Maddy reveal that the surgeries performed in the city involve much more than cosmetic changes—the surgeries also change the way people think. They make people docile. Tally decides to abandon her mission and throws her locket into a fire in a show of affection for David. Tally doesn’t realize, however, that the pendant is activated once it is destroyed.
Special Circumstances raids the Smoke a few hours later, burning it to the ground. Tally and David escape, but the others are captured and taken back to the city.

Matured,"In a series of vignettes, The House on Mango Street covers a year in the life of Esperanza, a Chicana (Mexican-American girl), who is about twelve years old when the novel begins. During the year, she moves with her family into a house on Mango Street. The house is a huge improvement from the family’s previous apartment, and it is the first home her parents actually own. However, the house is not what Esperanza has dreamed of, because it is run-down and small. The house is in the center of a crowded Latino neighborhood in Chicago, a city where many of the poor areas are racially segregated. Esperanza does not have any privacy, and she resolves that she will someday leave Mango Street and have a house all her own.
Esperanza matures significantly during the year, both sexually and emotionally. The novel charts her life as she makes friends, grows hips, develops her first crush, endures sexual assault, and begins to write as a way of expressing herself and as a way to escape the neighborhood. The novel also includes the stories of many of Esperanza’s neighbors, giving a full picture of the neighborhood and showing the many possible paths Esperanza may follow in the future.
After moving to the house, Esperanza quickly befriends Lucy and Rachel, two Chicana girls who live across the street. Lucy, Rachel, Esperanza, and Esperanza’s little sister, Nenny, have many adventures in the small space of their neighborhood. They buy a bike, learn exciting stories about boys from a young woman named Marin, explore a junk shop, and have intimate conversations while playing Double Dutch (jumping rope). The girls are on the brink of puberty and sometimes find themselves sexually vulnerable, such as when they walk around their neighborhood in high-heeled shoes or when Esperanza is kissed by an older man at her first job. During the first half of the year, the girls are content to live and play in their child’s world. At school, Esperanza feels ashamed about her family’s poverty and her difficult-to-pronounce name. She secretly writes poems that she shares only with older women she trusts.
Over the summer, Esperanza slips into puberty. She suddenly likes it when boys watch her dance, and she enjoys dreaming about them. Esperanza’s newfound sexual maturity, combined with the death of two of her family members, her grandfather and her Aunt Lupe, bring her closer to the world of adults. She begins to closely watch the women in her neighborhood. This second half of The House on Mango Street presents a string of stories about older women in the neighborhood, all of whom are even more stuck in their situations and, quite literally, in their houses, than Esperanza is. Meanwhile, during the beginning of the following school year, Esperanza befriends Sally, a girl her age who is more sexually mature than Lucy or Rachel. Sally, meanwhile, has her own agenda. She uses boys and men as an escape route from her abusive father. Esperanza is not completely comfortable with Sally’s sexual experience, and their friendship results in a crisis when Sally leaves Esperanza alone, and a group of boys sexually assaults Esperanza in her absence.
Esperanza’s traumatic experiences as Sally’s friend, in conjunction with her detailed observations of the older women in her neighborhood, cement her desire to escape Mango Street and to have her own house. When Esperanza finds herself emotionally ready to leave her neighborhood, however, she discovers that she will never fully be able to leave Mango Street behind, and that after she leaves she’ll have to return to help the women she has left. At the end of the year, Esperanza remains on Mango Street, but she has matured extensively. She has a stronger desire to leave and understands that writing will help her put distance between herself and her situation. Though for now writing helps her escape only emotionally, in the future it may help her to escape physically as well."
Coinage,"A Raisin in the Sun portrays a few weeks in the life of the Youngers, a Black family living on the South Side of Chicago in the 1950s. When the play opens, the Youngers are about to receive an insurance check for $10,000. This money comes from the deceased Mr. Younger’s life insurance policy. Each of the adult members of the family has an idea as to what he or she would like to do with this money. The matriarch of the family, Mama, wants to buy a house to fulfill a dream she shared with her husband. Mama’s son, Walter Lee, would rather use the money to invest in a liquor store with his friends. He believes that the investment will solve the family’s financial problems forever. Walter’s wife, Ruth, agrees with Mama, however, and hopes that she and Walter can provide more space and opportunity for their son, Travis. Finally, Beneatha, Walter’s sister and Mama’s daughter, wants to use the money for her medical school tuition. She also wishes that her family members were not so interested in assimilating into the white world. Beneatha instead tries to find her identity by looking back to the past and to Africa.
As the play progresses, the Youngers clash over their competing dreams. Ruth discovers that she is pregnant but fears that if she has the child, she will put more financial pressure on her family members. When Walter says nothing to Ruth’s admission that she is considering abortion, Mama puts a down payment on a house for the whole family. She believes that a bigger, brighter dwelling will help them all. This house is in Clybourne Park, an entirely white neighborhood. When the Youngers’ future neighbors find out that the Youngers are moving in, they send Mr. Lindner, from the Clybourne Park Improvement Association, to offer the Youngers money in return for staying away. The Youngers refuse the deal, even after Walter loses the rest of the money ($6,500) to his friend Willy Harris, who persuades Walter to invest in the liquor store and then runs off with his cash.
In the meantime, Beneatha rejects her suitor, George Murchison, whom she believes to be shallow and blind to the problems of race. Subsequently, she receives a marriage proposal from her Nigerian boyfriend, Joseph Asagai, who wants Beneatha to get a medical degree and move to Africa with him (Beneatha does not make her choice before the end of the play). The Youngers eventually move out of the apartment, fulfilling the family’s long-held dream. Their future seems uncertain and slightly dangerous, but they are optimistic and determined to live a better life. They believe that they can succeed if they stick together as a family and resolve to defer their dreams no longer."
Anyone,"Eight people, all strangers to each other, are invited to Indian Island, off the English coast. Vera Claythorne, a former governess, thinks she has been hired as a secretary; Philip Lombard, an adventurer, and William Blore, an ex-detective, think they have been hired to look out for trouble over the weekend; Dr. Armstrong thinks he has been hired to look after the wife of the island’s owner. Emily Brent, General Macarthur, Tony Marston, and Judge Wargrave think they are going to visit old friends.
	When they arrive on the island, the guests are greeted by Mr. and Mrs. Rogers, the butler and housekeeper, who report that the host, someone they call Mr. Owen, will not arrive until the next day. That evening, as all the guests gather in the drawing room after an excellent dinner, they hear a recorded voice accusing each of them of a specific murder committed in the past and never uncovered. They compare notes and realize that none of them, including the servants, knows “Mr. Owen,” which suggests that they were brought here according to someone’s strange plan.
	As they discuss what to do, Tony Marston chokes on poisoned whiskey and dies. Frightened, the party retreats to bed, where almost everyone is plagued by guilt and memories of their crimes. Vera Claythorne notices the similarity between the death of Marston and the first verse of a nursery rhyme, “Ten Little Indians,” that hangs in each bedroom. 
	The next morning the guests find that Mrs. Rogers apparently died in her sleep. The guests hope to leave that morning, but the boat that regularly delivers supplies to the island does not show up. Blore, Lombard, and Armstrong decide that the deaths must have been murders and determine to scour the island in search of the mysterious Mr. Owen. They find no one, however. Meanwhile, the oldest guest, General Macarthur, feels sure he is going to die and goes to look out at the ocean. Before lunch, Dr. Armstrong finds the general dead of a blow to the head.
	The remaining guests meet to discuss their situation. They decide that one of them must be the killer. Many make vague accusations, but Judge Wargrave reminds them that the existing evidence suggests any of them could be the killer. Afternoon and dinner pass restlessly, and everyone goes to bed, locking his or her door before doing so. The next morning, they find that Rogers has been killed while chopping wood in preparation for breakfast. At this point, the guests feel sure the murders are being carried out according to the dictates of the nursery rhyme. Also, they realize that the dining-room table initially featured ten Indian figures, but with each death one of the figures disappears.
	After breakfast, Emily Brent feels slightly giddy, and she remains alone at the table for a while. She is soon found dead, her neck having been injected with poison. At this point, Wargrave initiates an organized search of everyone’s belongings, and anything that could be used as a weapon is locked away. The remaining guests sit together, passing time and casting suspicious looks at each other. Finally, Vera goes to take a bath, but she is startled by a piece of seaweed hanging from her ceiling and cries out. Blore, Lombard, and Armstrong run to help her, only to return downstairs to find Wargrave draped in a curtain that resembles courtroom robes and bearing a red mark on his forehead. Armstrong examines the body and reports that Wargrave has been shot in the head.
	That night, Blore hears footsteps in the hall; upon checking, he finds that Armstrong is not in his room. Blore and Lombard search for Armstrong, but they cannot find him anywhere in the house or on the island. When they return from searching, they discover another Indian figure missing from the table.
	Vera, Lombard, and Blore go outside, resolving to stay in the safety of the open land. Blore decides to go back into the house to get food. The other two hear a crash, and they find someone has pushed a statue out of a second-story window, killing Blore as he approached the house. Vera and Lombard retreat to the shore, where they find Armstrong’s drowned body on the beach. Convinced that Lombard is the killer, Vera steals Lombard’s gun and shoots him. She returns to her bedroom to rest, happy to have survived. But upon finding a noose waiting for her in her room, she feels a strange compulsion to enact the last line of the nursery rhyme, and hangs herself.
	The mystery baffles the police until a manuscript in a bottle is found. The late Judge Wargrave wrote the manuscript explaining that he planned the murders because he wanted to punish those whose crimes are not punishable under law. Wargrave frankly admits to his own lust for blood and pleasure in seeing the guilty punished. When a doctor told Wargrave he was dying, he decided to die in a blaze, instead of letting his life trickle away. He discusses how he chose his victims and how he did away with Marston, Mr. and Mrs. Rogers, Macarthur, and Emily Brent. Wargrave then describes how he tricked Dr. Armstrong into helping him fake his own death, promising to meet the doctor by the cliffs to discuss a plan. When Armstrong arrived, Wargrave pushed him over the edge into the sea, then returned to the house and pretended to be dead. His ruse enabled him to dispose of the rest of the guests without drawing their suspicion. Once Vera hanged herself on a noose that he prepared for her, Wargrave planned to shoot himself in such a way that his body would fall onto the bed as if it had been laid there. Thus, he hoped, the police would find ten dead bodies on an empty island."
Incorporated,"John Howard Griffin, the author and main character of Black Like Me, is a middle-aged white man living in Mansfield, Texas, in 1959. Deeply committed to the cause of racial justice and frustrated by his inability as a white man to understand the Black experience, Griffin decides to take a radical step. He decides to undergo medical treatment to change the color of his skin and temporarily become a Black man. After securing the support of his wife and of George Levitan, the editor of a Black-oriented magazine called Sepia which will fund Griffin's experience in return for an article about it, Griffin sets out for New Orleans to begin his life posing as a Black man. He finds a contact in the Black community, a soft-spoken, wise shoe-shiner named Sterling Williams, and begins a dermatological regimen of exposure to ultraviolet light, oral medication, and skin dyes. Eventually, Griffin looks in the mirror and sees a Black man looking back. He briefly panics, feeling that he has lost his identity, and then he sets out to explore the Black community.
Griffin expects to find prejudice, oppression, and hardship, but he is shocked at the extent of it. Everywhere he goes, he experiences difficulties and insults. The word “n*****” seems to echo from every street corner. It is impossible to find a job, or even a restroom that Blacks are allowed to use. Clerks refuse to cash his checks, and a white bully nearly attacks him before he chases the man away. After several traumatic days in New Orleans, Griffin decides to travel into the Deep South of Mississippi and Alabama, which are reputed to be even worse for Black people. (In Mississippi, a grand jury has just refused to indict a lynch mob that murdered a Black man before he could stand trial.) In Mississippi, he is disheartened and exhausted, so he calls a white friend named P.D. East, a newspaperman who is ferociously opposed to racism. He spends a day with East, during which time they discuss the way racial prejudice has been incorporated into the South's legal code by bigoted writers and politicians. Eventually, a rejuvenated Griffin leaves for a long hitchhiking trip throughout Alabama and Mississippi.
In general, Griffin finds that conditions for Black people are appalling, and that Black communities seem run-down and defeated. He even notices a look of defeat and hopelessness on his own face, after only a few weeks as a Black man. In Montgomery, however, the Black community is charged with determination and energy by the example of one of its leaders, a preacher named Marin Luther King, Jr. Black people in Montgomery have begun practicing passive resistance, a nonviolent form of refusing to comply with racist laws and rules.
Griffin, again depressed and weary of life as a Black man, briefly stops taking his medication and lightens his skin back to his normal color. He begins alternating back and forth between races, visiting a place first as a Black man and then as a white man. He notices immediately that when he is a white man, whites treat him with respect and Black people treat him with suspicious fear; when he is a Black man, Black people treat him with generosity and warmth, while whites treat him with hostility and contempt. Griffin concludes that the races do not understand one another at all, and that a tolerant dialogue is needed to bridge the terrible gap separating them.
In Atlanta, Griffin conducts a long series of interviews with Black leaders before returning to New Orleans to make a photographic record of his time there. He then goes off his medication entirely, permanently returning his skin color to white. He returns home to his family and writes his article, which is published in March 1960. After the article appears, Griffin is called on to do interviews with prominent television shows and newsmagazines. The story of his amazing experience quickly spreads around the world, and he receives a flood of congratulatory mail.
In Mansfield, however, the prevalent attitude is that of racism, and Griffin and his family become the subject of hateful reprisals. An effigy of Griffin, painted half white and half black, is burned on Main Street; a cross is burned in a Negro schoolyard; threats are made against Griffin, including one to castrate him. By August, things are so bad that he has decided to move his family to Mexico. Before he goes, he has a talk with a young Black boy, to whom he explains that racism is a result of social conditioning, not any inherent quality within Blacks or whites. He issues a plea for tolerance and understanding between the races, fearing that, if the current conflict is sustained, it will explode in an outbreak of terrible violence."
Arguments,"In Common Sense, Thomas Paine argues for American independence. His argument begins with more general, theoretical reflections about government and religion, then progresses onto the specifics of the colonial situation.
Paine begins by distinguishing between government and society. Society, according to Paine, is everything constructive and good that people join together to accomplish. Government, on the other hand, is an institution whose sole purpose is to protect us from our own vices. Government has its origins in the evil of man and is therefore a necessary evil at best. Paine says that government's sole purpose is to protect life, liberty and property, and that a government should be judged solely on the basis of the extent to which it accomplishes this goal.
Paine then considers an imagined scenario in which a small group of people has been placed on an island, and cut off from the rest of society. In time, these people develop ties with one another, and lawmaking becomes inevitable. Paine says the people will be much happier if they are responsible for the creation of the laws that rule them. Paine is also implicitly arguing that such a system of representation is also better for the American colonists. Having expressed his disagreement with British reign in America, Paine proceeds to launch a general attack on the British system of government. Paine says the British system is too complex and rife with contradictions, and that the monarchy is granted far too much power. The British system pretends to offer a reasonable system of checks and balances, but in fact, it does not.
From here Paine moves on to discuss, in general, the notions of monarchy and hereditary succession. Man, Pain argues, was born into a state of equality, and the distinction that has arisen between king and subject is an unnatural one. At first, Paine says, the world was without kings, but the ancient Jews decided they wanted a king. This angered God, but he allowed them to have one. Paine presents pages of biblical evidence detailing God's wrath at the idea of the Jews having a king. The conclusion Paine reaches is that the practice of monarchy originates from sin, and is an institution that the Bible and God condemn. Paine calls hereditary succession an abominable practice. He says that even if people were to choose to have a king, that does not legitimize that King's child acting as a future ruler. Furthermore, hereditary succession has brought with it innumerable evils, such as incompetent kings, corruption, and civil war.
Having dispensed with the preliminary theoretical issues, Paine sets in to discuss the details of the American situation. In response to the argument that America has flourished under British rule, and therefore ought to stay under the king, Paine says that such an argument fails to realize that America has evolved and no longer needs Britain's help. Some say that Britain has protected America, and therefore deserves allegiance, but Paine responds that Britain has only watched over America in order to secure its own economic well-being. Paine adds that most recently, instead of watching over the colonies, the British have been attacking them, and are therefore undeserving of American loyalty.
Paine says that the colonies have little to gain from remaining attached to Britain. Commerce can be better conducted with the rest of Europe, but only after America becomes independent. Paine also asserts that if the colonies remain attached to Britain, the same problems that have arisen in the past will arise in the future. Paine argues that it is necessary to seek independence now, as to do otherwise would only briefly cover up problems that will surely reemerge.
Paine even proposes the form of government that the independent colonies should adopt. His recommendation is for a representative democracy that gives roughly equal weight to each of the colonies.
Paine explains why the current time is a good time to break free of Britain. Primarily, Paine focuses on the present size of the colonies, and on their current capabilities. He presents an inventory of the British Navy and gives calculations revealing how America could build a navy of comparable size. Paine recommends this as a way of ensuring America's security and prosperity in trade. Paine also argues that America is sufficiently small as to be united now. If time were to elapse, and the population of the colonies to grow, the same feeling of unity would not be present. Paine adds that if the Americans revolt now, they can use the vast expanses of uncharted land to the West in order to pay down some of the debt they will incur.
Paine says that as a colony of Britain, America lacks respectability on the international scene. They are seen simply as rebels, and cannot form substantial alliances with other nations. In order to prosper in the long term, the colonies need to be independent. Paine says that, by declaring independence, America will be able to ask for the help of other countries in its struggle for freedom. For all of these reasons, Paine says it is imperative and urgent that the colonies declare independence."
Politic,"Marjane “Marji” Satrapi is an intelligent, spirited, and very modern girl living with her parents in Iran’s capital of Tehran during the eventful period of Iranian history from the late 1970s into the early 1980s. In Persepolis: The Story of a Childhood, Marji’s remembers her life during those years, mostly from when she was about ten to age fourteen. This account includes how Marji and her family lived through and were affected by turbulent events that included the overthrow of the autocratic Shah of Iran by the Islamic revolution, the oppressive fundamentalist regime that replaced the Shah, and the devasting Iran-Iraq war.
The nation’s wealth has long made it a target of outside invaders, but Islamic revolution of 1979 has pushed out the Western-backed government of the Shah.  The revolution has ushered in a new Islamic regime that is bringing massive societal changes impacting how people are supposed to behave--including Marji and her family. Marji struggles to adjust to the changes at her liberal French bilingual school, which has become increasingly stricter. Girls are required to wear veils and female and male students are now separated. Marji’s wealthy and modern parents—her father, Ebi, and her mother, Taji—take part in the massive protests against the new regime’s strict rules on behavior (just as they had previously protested against the Shah’s regime). Marji’s parents worry when a photo of Marji’s mother a protest appears in newspapers magazines. Later, after a demonstration they are at turns violent, the Satrapis decide that openly protesting is too dangerous to continue to do.
Marji feels conflict between her own deeply spiritual feelings and the stark modernism of her parents. She talks to God at night and has believed she will become a prophet one day since she was six years old, Marji. But the revolution leads to Marji setting aside these ambitions while she studies and imitates protestors and revolutionaries. She mimics protestors in the garden of her house and studies books about famous revolutionaries and philosophers given to her by her parents. She fantasizes about becoming a hero and wants her parents to become heroes too. Marji’s relationship with God becomes strained, as she finds that she and God have less to talk about—although God does still come by to see her from time to time.
Marji thrills when she learns that rebels fill her family history. She learns that her grandfather was a prince and later a communist whom the Shah removed from power and that her uncle Anoosh, also a communist, spent nine years in prison during the Shah’s regime. Marji spends a short time with Anoosh, learning about his life. After the Shah fell from power in 1979, Anoosh was released from prison, but when Islamic fundamentalists consolidate their grip on power, they hunt Anoosh down, imprison him, and later execute him. Her new idol killed, Marji feels crushed. She completely abandons her faith in God and increasingly questions the pro-regime propaganda she hears—especially at school.
Marji deeply loves and identifies with of her parents, even if she does sometimes feel that their actions and behavior (as wealthy and privileged individuals) do not always live up to their pro-democratic and liberal rhetoric. Marji also has a special connection with her grandmother, who remains stoic and inspiring to Marji in spite of the turmoil and numerous tragedies stemming from political actions that impact her and the family. Marji’s uncle Anoosh is not Marji’s only direct experience with the cruel consequences of the government’s actions. Throughout the book, death and devastation occurs among Marji’s extended family and friends as direct results of the brutality and fanaticism of the Iranian regimes and the war with Iraq.
People had rejoiced when the Shah was forced out, but as Islamic fundamentalists retain power, Marji and her family watch as their neighbors’ behavior shifts back and forth to coincide with the current political winds. The neighbors go from wearing short skirts and drinking alcohol to covering themselves and denouncing the use of alcohol. Marji’s parents ask her to tell everyone that she prays every day, a lie they hope will keep Marji safe, but acknowledge that the rules seem foolish. Marji grows more rebellious, as she increasingly views the rules at school and elsewhere as hypocritical and difficult to follow. Armed with more knowledge and personal experience, Marji begins to act out in ways that put her safety at risk. In fact, she even (accidentally) hits her principal during an argument, which results in her expulsion from school. Fearing her rebellious behavior will get her killed, Marji’s mother tries to reason with Marji by telling her that it is not her responsibility to serve justice and that the bad guys eventually pay for their sins in the end.
The war with Iraq had originally inspired Marji to vocal patriotism in protection her country against another invasion, but Marji begins to realize there are greater forces behind the war. She sees how the Islamic regime needs the war to continue survive and keep power. The war promotes a sense of nationalism and pride in the public, and those who die in the war are hailed as “martyrs.” Marji sees thousands of poor boys lured into war without proper training. She becomes increasingly uncomfortable and aware of class differences within society. Poor young boys are lured into the army with gold-painted keys to the “kingdom of heaven” to help them enter paradise after dying on the battlefield, while children in her wealthy neighborhood are left alone.
More and more people try to escape Iran as the borders tighten and Iraqi forces bomb Tehran and other Iranian cities. Realizing that Marji’s chances of escaping Iran are narrowing, her parents make the difficult decision to send her abroad alone to finish school in Vienna, explaining that only a good education will free her of Iran. Marji feels heartbroken. She spends one last night with her grandmother, who gives her warm advice and inspires her to be compassionate and understanding while in Vienna. Marji gives away all of her prized contraband to her friends, including a Kim Wilde poster. At the airport, as Marji turns to say goodbye to her parents one last time to see that her mother, devasted by her only child’s departure, has fainted."

Healing,"Educated is primarily retrospective, consisting of Tara Westover's memories about her past. She tells the story of the events of her life from a vantage point in her late twenties, occasionally interjecting to comment on the process of trying to arrive at an accurate version of the past. Tara was born the youngest of seven children to parents whom she refers to as Faye and Gene (pseudonyms). The Westover family lived on a farm in rural Idaho, where Gene made a living salvaging scrap metal while Faye worked as an unlicensed midwife and herbal healer. Gene suffered from paranoid fears about interference from the federal government, and as a result he refused to allow his children to attend school, receive birth certificates, or receive medical attention. Gene was also a devout Mormon who believed in radical self-sufficiency and an impending Day of Judgement.
		
Shifts in the Westover family dynamic began to emerge when Tara was about nine. Her mother's work as a midwife increased her sense of independence, but after sustaining a serious and untreated brain injury in a car accident, Faye began to lose confidence in her skills, and focused instead on using herbal remedies and a form of intuitive healing. Around this time, Tyler (the third son) announced that he was going to attend college, which estranged him from his family. Tyler's absence forced Tara to become more involved in helping her father with his scrapping work, which left her constantly exposed to the possibility of dangerous injury. It also made her more curious about possibly pursuing an education herself. When Tara was ten, she told her disapproving father that she wanted to begin going to school, but nothing came of the idea.
As Tara grew into her teens, she acquired more independence from her family due to taking on various jobs and pursuing singing and musical theatre in the local community. However, her life was dominated by the strict rules and religious doctrine her father imposed, and Tara often worried about becoming sinful. When Tara was thirteen, her older brother Shawn moved back home. At first Shawn and Tara were close and spent a lot of time together. When Tara was about fifteen, however, Shawn began to be physically abusive toward her. His behavior only got worse after Shawn experienced a head injury. Tyler eventually realized that Shawn was hurting Tara, and he urged Tara to seriously consider applying to college and getting away from the family. Although she was uncertain at first, Tara began to study and was eventually accepted at Brigham Young University, having passed herself off as homeschooled.
In January 2004, when Tara was seventeen years old, she moved to Utah to begin her college education. She found the adjustment very difficult at first, but eventually began to excel in her studies. Tara's finances were precarious, and she had to hold multiple jobs and maintain very high grades to retain her scholarship. Her emerging independence also caused a threatening dynamic between her, Gene, and Shawn. Whenever Tara returned to Buck's Peak, her father manipulated her into working for him, while Shawn continued to physically and emotionally abuse her. Tara eventually confided to a bishop about her life, and he helped her to secure funding to finance her education. Tara's studies, and the people she met, also gradually opened her eyes to different realities and force her to realize how damaging and isolating her childhood has been. Tara eventually changed her major to studying history, and is encouraged to apply for a study abroad program at Cambridge University in England.
Tara's experience at Cambridge broadened her horizons even further, and she was encouraged to consider graduate studies. Tara still felt isolated from her peers, and ashamed of her origins. She hid most of her past even from her friends and the men she occasionally dated. She was eventually awarded a prestigious Cambridge Gates Fellowship and moved to England to pursue a Master's degree. She remained in close contact with her family and returned to Idaho regularly to visit, but her relationship with them deteriorated. Shawn was growing increasingly erratic and violent, and Tara feared for the safety of his wife and young child. By chance, she revealed to her sister Audrey that Shawn had been abusive with her, and Audrey later confided that Shawn abused her as well. Audrey blamed herself for not protecting her younger sister, and suggested that she and Tara confront their parents and Shawn about what happened to them.
By then Tara had built a happy life for herself in England, and was working on a PhD in history at Cambridge. However, the attempt to speak the truth quickly became a source of conflict in the family. Tara became more and more ostracized within her family, eventually culminating in Shawn learning that she had been telling their parents about the abuse she suffered. Realizing her family would never trust her claims, Tara became estranged from most of them, with the exception of Tyler.  The estrangement from her family prompted grief and depression for Tara, but she was finally able to heal, and successfully completed her PhD. By the end of her memoir, Tara has accepted that she may never have a relationship with her family again, but she takes pride in the independence she has established, and the life she has built for herself."
Radically,"Euripedes' Medea opens in a state of conflict. Jason has abandoned his wife, Medea, along with their two children. He hopes to advance his station by remarrying with Glauce, the daughter of Creon, king of Corinth, the Greek city where the play is set. All the events of play proceed out of this initial dilemma, and the involved parties become its central characters.
Outside the royal palace, a nurse laments the events that have lead to the present crisis. After a long series of trials and adventures, which ultimately forced Jason and Medea to seek exile in Corinth, the pair had settled down and established their family, achieving a degree of fame and respectability. Jason's recent abandonment of that family has crushed Medea emotionally, to the degree that she curses her own existence, as well as that of her two children.
Fearing a possible plot of revenge, Creon banishes Medea and her children from the city. After pleading for mercy, Medea is granted one day before she must leave, during which she plans to complete her quest for ""justice""--at this stage in her thinking, the murder of Creon, Glauce, and Jason. Jason accuses Medea of overreacting. By voicing her grievances so publicly, she has endangered her life and that of their children. He claims that his decision to remarry was in everyone's best interest. Medea finds him spineless, and she refuses to accept his token offers of help.
Appearing by chance in Corinth, Aegeus, King of Athens, offers Medea sanctuary in his home city in exchange for her knowledge of certain drugs that can cure his sterility. Now guaranteed an eventual haven in Athens, Medea has cleared all obstacles to completing her revenge, a plan which grows to include the murder of her own children; the pain their loss will cause her does not outweigh the satisfaction she will feel in making Jason suffer.
For the balance of the play, Medea engages in a ruse; she pretends to sympathize with Jason (bringing him into her confidence) and offers his wife ""gifts,"" a coronet and dress. Ostensibly, the gifts are meant to convince Glauce to ask her father to allow the children to stay in Corinth. The coronet and dress are actually poisoned, however, and their delivery causes Glauce's death. Seeing his daughter ravaged by the poison, Creon chooses to die by her side by dramatically embracing her and absorbing the poison himself.
A messenger recounts the gruesome details of these deaths, which Medea absorbs with cool attentiveness. Her earlier state of anxiety, which intensified as she struggled with the decision to commit infanticide, has now given way to an assured determination to fulfill her plans. Against the protests of the chorus, Medea murders her children and flees the scene in a dragon-pulled chariot provided by her grandfather, the Sun-God. Jason is left cursing his lot; his hope of advancing his station by abandoning Medea and marrying Glauce, the conflict which opened the play, has been annihilated, and everything he values has been lost through the deaths that conclude the tragedy."
Walked,"Salamanca Tree Hiddle is taking a trip with her grandparents from Euclid, Ohio to Lewiston, Idaho, to visit her mother's final resting place. Along the way, Salamanca, or Sal, tells her grandparents the story of her best friend, Phoebe Winterbottom, whose mother, like Sal's, unexpectedly decides to leave home. Sal meets Phoebe when Sal and her father leave their farm in Bybanks, Kentucky, to Euclid, Ohio, where Margaret Cadaver, whom Sal's father befriended after her mother's death, lives. Phoebe is a high-strung, prim, and wildly imaginative girl. She feels certain that some sinister connection exists between the morbidly-named Mrs. Cadaver, who is her next-door neighbor, the mysterious notes that keep appearing on her family's doorstep, and the strange boy, whom Phoebe dubs the lunatic, who appears at the house one day. Sal gradually becomes caught up in her friend's melodrama and finds herself engaged in a heady flirtation with a boy from school, Ben.
Sal intersperses Phoebe's story with memories of her mother, who was a loving, spontaneous, and gentle woman who could not shake off a deep sense of inadequacy next to her selfless husband. Phoebe's mother shares this sense of alienation. Her family routinely ignores her, and though she works assiduously as a mother and wife, she wonders at the smallness of her life. By this point in Sal's tale, she and her grandparents have reached South Dakota. They stop to swim in the Missouri River, where a snake bites Gram's leg. Sal and her grandfather rush Gram to the hospital, and although Gram recovers by the next morning, her health begins to falter after this point.
One day, Phoebe's mother disappears, leaving nary a word of explanation. Phoebe feels certain she has been kidnapped and begins an obsessive investigation for clues. Sal then retells the story of her own mother's disappearance. Sal, playing a good distance from the house, had fallen from the tree and broken her leg. Her mother, who was pregnant, carried Sal home and rushed her to the hospital. Later, she went into an early labor, lost the baby, and nearly lost her life. Overwhelmed with sadness, she insisted on taking a trip by herself to visit a cousin in Lewiston, Idaho. Sal and her grandparents are following the path Sal's mother took on her trip to Idaho.
Phoebe's family is growing more and more upset as the days go by, and Mr. Winterbottom, a reserved and stoic man, begins crying one day when Phoebe desperately insists that Mrs. Winterbottom loves her too much to leave without an explanation. Finally, Sal and Phoebe rush over to the police office to offer them the meager evidence they have collected. While there, Sal finds that the strange boy, the lunatic, who appeared on the porch earlier, is actually the police sergeant's son. Later that day, Sal discovers that Mrs. Cadaver, whom she resisted and resented due to her friendship with her father, suffered a great loss only a few years prior, when a car accident killed her husband and blinded her mother.
Sal and her grandparents take in Old Faithful, and Gram, whose breathing is troubled, revels in the splendor of the powerful geyser. When they leave Yellowstone National Park, Sal resumes her story, driven by a sense of urgency to finish it as soon as possible. Sal and Phoebe determine that the sergeant's son lives at a nearby college campus, and, convinced he holds the key to the mystery, take a bus to visit him. On campus, the two girls find the lunatic and Mrs. Winterbottom sitting on a bench, holding hands. Sal, overwhelmed, runs away as fast as her legs can carry her. She finds herself at a mental hospital, where, to her surprise, she finds Ben and his mother, who is a patient at the hospital. The two young people giddily share a delicious first kiss. Mrs. Winterbottom returns home a few days later and explains to her family that the lunatic is actually her illegitimate son, about whom she had always been afraid to tell her family for fear of letting them down. The Winterbottoms are shaken, but ready to listen to Mrs. Winterbottom. At the same time, Sal decides that she will make amends with Mrs. Cadaver and listen to her story. Mrs. Cadaver explains to Sal that she and Sal's mother became friends on the long bus trip from Ohio to Idaho, and that Mrs. Cadaver and Sal's father became friends because Mrs. Cadaver was the lone survivor of the accident that killed Sal's mother and was able to tell Sal's father about the last days and moments of Sal's mother's life.
Sal and her grandparents have reached Coeur D'Alene in northern Idaho, but Gramps and Sal must rush Gram, who is gravely ill, to a hospital. Gramps will not leave her side, but knowing that Sal feels she must visit her mother's grave on her birthday, which is the next day, allows Sal to drive down the steep, tortuous roads on her own. Sal makes the perilous drive in the dead of night, and finally stops at an outlook on a steep, switchbacked road where her mother's bus, more than a year prior, had tumbled off the road. Sal climbs down to inspect the wrecked, abandoned bus. When she returns to the car, a sheriff stands ready to arrest her, but when he hears her story, he drives Sal to her mother's grave and later back to Coeur D'Alene. Sal, already overwhelmed by tragedy, discovers that her grandmother has died.
Sal and her father later return to their farm in Bybanks, Kentucky and begin trying to rebuild their lives their without her mother. Sal, who has made peace with her mother's tragic death, looks forward to each day on the farm and to the upcoming visit of all her friends from Euclid, Ohio."
Dangerous,"In a pair of sumptuous drawingrooms, one in a Parisian mansion, the other in a chateau on a luxurious estate in the countryside surrounding Paris, two aristocrats are very bored. The Marquise de Merteuil decides, therefore, to construct a little intrigue for her own amusement and the amusement of her former lover, the Vicomte de Valmont. The Marquise is aware that a young girl of good family, Cécile Volanges, has only just left the convent so that she can be married to the Comte de Gercourt. Now, the Marquise has a bone to pick with this particular Comte, and so she suggests to the Vicomte that he seduce and debauch Cécile to create a scandal and humiliate Gercourt. Valmont accepts the Marquise's proposal somewhat coolly, since he already has his eyes on another prey, the highly religious Présidente de Tourvel, the chaste wife of a member of Parliament. But, never one to refuse a challenge, Valmont suggests that he and the Marquise enter into a slightly different bet: if he can obtain written proof that he has slept with the Présidente, the Marquise must yield herself to him.
Meanwhile, Cécile has been presented to society, and in society she meets the charming and gentle Chevalier Danceny. Danceny becomes Cécile's music teacher and slowly, with a little coaxing from the Marquise de Merteuil, the two young people fall in love. During this time, Valmont is out in the country on his aunt's estate, trying to turn the Présidente de Tourvel's head. He has very little luck in this department despite his use of every known trick in the book. Then, as coincidence would have, Cécile's mother, Madame Volanges, who corresponds regularly with the Présidente de Tourvel, happens to say some rather unflattering things about Valmont in a letter which Valmont just happens to steal and read. And thus it is that Valmont resolves to seduce the little Volanges as revenge for her mother's only too accurate trash-talk.
Cécile's ""seduction"" would be more accurately termed ""rape,"" but the girl is persuaded to enter into a bizarre student-teacher relationship with Valmont, so that for a while she is being courted by Danceny and ""loved"" nightly by Valmont. During his time as Cécile's teacher, Valmont is also able to win the heart of the Présidente de Tourvel.
However, the Marquise de Merteuil is not so easily pleased. Rather than encourage the Vicomte de Valmont to meet the conditions of their original agreement, she mocks him for having fallen in love with the Présidente de Tourvel. Valmont's pride does not withstand these attacks very well, and to avoid compromising his reputation as a good-for-nothing gigolo, he leaves the Présidente cold, with no explanation. Cécile fares no better, after a particularly rough night in Valmont's room, she miscarries his child.
Now things are really looking bad for everyone involved. The Présidente de Tourvel removes herself to a convent where she proceeds to die of grief and shame. Merteuil and Valmont are never able to reconcile their little snit and can only agree to go to war with one another. Danceny learns that Valmont seduced Cécile and challenges him to a duel; and Danceny wins the duel. Valmont hands over his correspondence with the Marquise to Danceny on his deathbed; all of society learns of her schemes and machinations. The Marquise is forced to flee town and, like a wicked old witch, is never heard from again. Full of regret for her activities with Valmont, Cécile returns to the convent from whence she came, with the intention of becoming a nun."
Patiently,"In The English Patient, the past and the present are continually intertwined. The narrative structure intersperses descriptions of present action with thoughts and conversations that offer glimpses of past events and occurrences. Though there is no single narrator, the story is alternatively seen from the point of view of each of the main characters.
The novel opens with Hana, a young nurse, gardening outside a villa in Italy in 1945. The European theater of the war has just ended with the Germans retreating up the Italian countryside. As the Germans retreated, they left hidden bombs and mines everywhere, so the landscape is particularly dangerous. Although the other nurses and patients have left the villa to escape to a safer place, Hana decides to stay in the villa with her patient.
Hana does not know much about the man for whom she cares. Found in the wreckage of a plane crash, he been burned beyond recognition, his whole body black and even the slightest touch painful to him. He talks about the Bedouin tribe who found him in the wreckage, cared for his wounds, and eventually returned him to a British camp in 1944. He does not know who they were, but he feels grateful to them nonetheless. To pass the time, Hana reads to the English patient—she assumes he is English by his manner and speech—and also gardens, fixes up the villa, and plays hopscotch. Sometimes she picks up the patient's notebook, a copy of Herodotus's The Histories marked throughout with his own notes, figures, and observations, and reads to him or to herself.
One day, a man with bandaged hands named Caravaggio arrives at the villa. He is an old family friend of Hana's father, Patrick, and had heard about her location while he was recovering in a hospital a few miles away. In Canada, where Caravaggio knew Hana years ago, he was a thief. He tells her how his skills were legitimized in the war and how he put them to use working for British Intelligence in North Africa. He tells her that the Germans caught him after an attempt to steal a camera from a woman's room. They tortured him and cut off his thumbs, leaving his hands mutilated and nearly useless. Although he has recovered somewhat, he is still addicted to morphine. In the villa, he reminisces with Hana and mourns with her over the death of her father in the war.
As Hana plays the piano in the library, two soldiers come in and stand alongside while she plays. One of them is Kip, an Indian Sikh trained as a sapper, or bomb-defuser, in the British army. After hearing the piano, Kip has come to clear the villa of bombs, knowing that the Germans frequently booby-trapped musical instruments. Kip and the English patient get along very well, as they are both experts in guns and bombs and enjoy talking to each other and sharing stories. Kip makes camp in the garden of the villa and becomes a part of the ""family"" that now exists there. He goes off into town every day to clear more bombs from the area and to bury fellow sappers who have died. Kip's job is extremely dangerous. He feels a strong attraction to Hana, and soon they become lovers.
Asked about his past, the English patient begins to tell the others his story. His real name is Almasy, though this is not definitively confirmed until Chapter IX. He spent the years from 1930 to the start of World War II exploring the North African desert. His job was to make observations, draw maps, and search for ancient oases in the sands. Along with his fellow European counterparts, Almasy knew every inch of the desert and made many trips across it. In 1936, a young man from Oxford, Geoffrey Clifton, and his new wife Katharine, joined their party. Geoffrey owned a plane, which the party found especially useful in helping to map the desert. The explorers, Almasy, and the Cliftons got along very well. One night, after hearing Katharine read a passage from his book of Herodotus, Almasy realized he was in love with her. They soon began a torrid and tumultuous affair. Everywhere they stole glances and moments, and they were obsessed with each other. Finally, in 1938, Katharine broke off their affair, telling Almasy that Geoffrey would go mad if he ever found out. Although their affair was over, Almasy remained haunted by her, and he tried to punish her for hurting him by being particularly mean to her in public. At some point, Geoffrey somehow found out about the affair.
World War II broke out in 1939, and Almasy decided to close up their camp and arranged for Geoffrey to pick him up in the desert. Geoffrey arrived in his plane with Katharine. Geoffrey attempted to kill all three of them by crashing the plane into Almasy, who was standing on the ground. The plane missed Almasy, but the crash killed Geoffrey, left Katharine severely injured, and left them with no way to escape the desert. Almasy placed Katharine in a nearby cave, covering her with a parachute for warmth, and promised to come back for her. He walked across the desert for four days until he reached the nearest town, but when he got there, the English army would not help him get back to Katharine. Because Almasy had a foreign-sounding name, the British were suspicious and locked him up as a spy, prevented him from saving Katharine.
Almasy was eventually released, but he knew it was too late to save her. He worked for the Germans, helping their spies make their way across the desert into Cairo. After he left Cairo, his truck broke down in the desert. Without transportation, he walked to the cave to get Katharine. He took her dead body and placed it in a plane that had been buried beneath the sand. The plane malfunctioned during their flight and caught fire. Almasy parachuted down from the plane, his body covered in flames. That was the point at which the Bedouins found him and cared for his burns.
Little by little, the English patient tells this whole story. Caravaggio, who has suspected the English patient was not really English, has his suspicions confirmed. He fills in gaps for the Almasy, telling him that Geoffrey Clifton was really an agent of British Intelligence and that Intelligence had known about Almasy and Katharine's affair the whole time. They knew Almasy had started helping the Germans and planned to kill him in the desert. They lost him between Cairo and the plane crash, and now, of course, he is unrecognizable.
The focus of the novel shifts to Kip, and we are told his entire story. Although Kip's brother always distrusted the west, Kip went willingly to serve in the British army. He was trained as a bomb defuser under Lord Suffolk, a true English gentleman, and was then virtually welcomed into an English family. Kip soon grew quite skillful at his job, able to figure out both the ""joke"" and the ""character"" of each bomb he tackled. Lord Suffolk and his group were blown up defusing a bomb, and Kip decided to leave England and become a sapper in Italy.
Kip has felt emotionally removed from everyone in his job as a sapper. When he meets Hana, he uses her to once again connect to humanity. All the residents of the villa celebrate Hana's twenty-first birthday, and Kip grows comfortable as her lover. When August comes, however, Kip hears on the radio of the atomic bomb that the United States has dropped on Japan. He becomes enraged, knowing that a western country would never commit such an atrocity against another white country. He takes his gun and threatens to kill the English patient, whom he sees as a symbol of the West. Kip does not kill Almasy, but takes off on his motorcycle, leaving the villa forever. Years later, he is a doctor in India with a family of his own. Though he is happy and fulfilled in his new life, he often wonders about Hana."
Pacification,"Okonkwo is a wealthy and respected warrior of the Umuofia clan, a lower Nigerian tribe that is part of a consortium of nine connected villages. He is haunted by the actions of Unoka, his cowardly and spendthrift father, who died in disrepute, leaving many village debts unsettled. In response, Okonkwo became a clansman, warrior, farmer, and family provider extraordinaire. He has a twelve-year-old son named Nwoye whom he finds lazy; Okonkwo worries that Nwoye will end up a failure like Unoka.
In a settlement with a neighboring tribe, Umuofia wins a virgin and a fifteen-year-old boy. Okonkwo takes charge of the boy, Ikemefuna, and finds an ideal son in him. Nwoye likewise forms a strong attachment to the newcomer. Despite his fondness for Ikemefuna and despite the fact that the boy begins to call him “father,” Okonkwo does not let himself show any affection for him.
During the Week of Peace, Okonkwo accuses his youngest wife, Ojiugo, of negligence. He severely beats her, breaking the peace of the sacred week. He makes some sacrifices to show his repentance, but he has shocked his community irreparably.
Ikemefuna stays with Okonkwo’s family for three years. Nwoye looks up to him as an older brother and, much to Okonkwo’s pleasure, develops a more masculine attitude. One day, the locusts come to Umuofia—they will come every year for seven years before disappearing for another generation. The village excitedly collects them because they are good to eat when cooked.
Ogbuefi Ezeudu, a respected village elder, informs Okonkwo in private that the Oracle has said that Ikemefuna must be killed. He tells Okonkwo that because Ikemefuna calls him “father,” Okonkwo should not take part in the boy’s death. Okonkwo lies to Ikemefuna, telling him that they must return him to his home village. Nwoye bursts into tears.
As he walks with the men of Umuofia, Ikemefuna thinks about seeing his mother. After several hours of walking, some of Okonkwo’s clansmen attack the boy with machetes. Ikemefuna runs to Okonkwo for help. But Okonkwo, who doesn’t wish to look weak in front of his fellow tribesmen, cuts the boy down despite the Oracle’s admonishment. When Okonkwo returns home, Nwoye deduces that his friend is dead.
Okonkwo sinks into a depression, neither able to sleep nor eat. He visits his friend Obierika and begins to feel revived a bit. Okonkwo’s daughter Ezinma falls ill, but she recovers after Okonkwo gathers leaves for her medicine.
The death of Ogbuefi Ezeudu is announced to the surrounding villages by means of the ekwe, a musical instrument. Okonkwo feels guilty because the last time Ezeudu visited him was to warn him against taking part in Ikemefuna’s death. At Ogbuefi Ezeudu’s large and elaborate funeral, the men beat drums and fire their guns. Tragedy compounds upon itself when Okonkwo’s gun explodes and kills Ogbuefi Ezeudu’s sixteen-year-old son.
Because killing a clansman is a crime against the earth goddess, Okonkwo must take his family into exile for seven years in order to atone. He gathers his most valuable belongings and takes his family to his mother’s natal village, Mbanta. The men from Ogbuefi Ezeudu’s quarter burn Okonkwo’s buildings and kill his animals to cleanse the village of his sin.
Okonkwo’s kinsmen, especially his uncle, Uchendu, receive him warmly. They help him build a new compound of huts and lend him yam seeds to start a farm. Although he is bitterly disappointed at his misfortune, Okonkwo reconciles himself to life in his motherland.
During the second year of Okonkwo’s exile, Obierika brings several bags of cowries (shells used as currency) that he has made by selling Okonkwo’s yams. Obierika plans to continue to do so until Okonkwo returns to the village. Obierika also brings the bad news that Abame, another village, has been destroyed by the white man.
Soon afterward, six missionaries travel to Mbanta. Through an interpreter named Mr. Kiaga, the missionaries’ leader, Mr. Brown, speaks to the villagers. He tells them that their gods are false and that worshipping more than one God is idolatrous. But the villagers do not understand how the Holy Trinity can be accepted as one God. Although his aim is to convert the residents of Umuofia to Christianity, Mr. Brown does not allow his followers to antagonize the clan.
Mr. Brown grows ill and is soon replaced by Reverend James Smith, an intolerant and strict man. The more zealous converts are relieved to be free of Mr. Brown’s policy of restraint. One such convert, Enoch, dares to unmask an egwugwu during the annual ceremony to honor the earth deity, an act equivalent to killing an ancestral spirit. The next day, the egwugwu burn Enoch’s compound and Reverend Smith’s church to the ground.
The District Commissioner is upset by the burning of the church and requests that the leaders of Umuofia meet with him. Once they are gathered, however, the leaders are handcuffed and thrown in jail, where they suffer insults and physical abuse.
After the prisoners are released, the clansmen hold a meeting, during which five court messengers approach and order the clansmen to desist. Expecting his fellow clan members to join him in uprising, Okonkwo kills their leader with his machete. When the crowd allows the other messengers to escape, Okonkwo realizes that his clan is not willing to go to war.
When the District Commissioner arrives at Okonkwo’s compound, he finds that Okonkwo has hanged himself. Obierika and his friends lead the commissioner to the body. Obierika explains that suicide is a grave sin; thus, according to custom, none of Okonkwo’s clansmen may touch his body. The commissioner, who is writing a book about Africa, believes that the story of Okonkwo’s rebellion and death will make for an interesting paragraph or two. He has already chosen the book’s title: The Pacification of the Primitive Tribes of the Lower Niger."
Sales,"As a flute melody plays, Willy Loman returns to his home in Brooklyn one night, exhausted from a failed sales trip. His wife, Linda, tries to persuade him to ask his boss, Howard Wagner, to let him work in New York so that he won’t have to travel. Willy says that he will talk to Howard the next day. Willy complains that Biff, his older son who has come back home to visit, has yet to make something of himself. Linda scolds Willy for being so critical, and Willy goes to the kitchen for a snack.
As Willy talks to himself in the kitchen, Biff and his younger brother, Happy, who is also visiting, reminisce about their adolescence and discuss their father’s babbling, which often includes criticism of Biff’s failure to live up to Willy’s expectations. As Biff and Happy, dissatisfied with their lives, fantasize about buying a ranch out West, Willy becomes immersed in a daydream. He praises his sons, now younger, who are washing his car. The young Biff, a high school football star, and the young Happy appear. They interact affectionately with their father, who has just returned from a business trip. Willy confides in Biff and Happy that he is going to open his own business one day, bigger than that owned by his neighbor, Charley. Charley’s son, Bernard, enters looking for Biff, who must study for math class in order to avoid failing. Willy points out to his sons that although Bernard is smart, he is not “well liked,” which will hurt him in the long run.
A younger Linda enters, and the boys leave to do some chores. Willy boasts of a phenomenally successful sales trip, but Linda coaxes him into revealing that his trip was actually only meagerly successful. Willy complains that he soon won’t be able to make all of the payments on their appliances and car. He complains that people don’t like him and that he’s not good at his job. As Linda consoles him, he hears the laughter of his mistress. He approaches The Woman, who is still laughing, and engages in another reminiscent daydream. Willy and The Woman flirt, and she thanks him for giving her stockings.
The Woman disappears, and Willy fades back into his prior daydream, in the kitchen. Linda, now mending stockings, reassures him. He scolds her mending and orders her to throw the stockings out. Bernard bursts in, again looking for Biff. Linda reminds Willy that Biff has to return a football that he stole, and she adds that Biff is too rough with the neighborhood girls. Willy hears The Woman laugh and explodes at Bernard and Linda. Both leave, and though the daydream ends, Willy continues to mutter to himself. The older Happy comes downstairs and tries to quiet Willy. Agitated, Willy shouts his regret about not going to Alaska with his brother, Ben, who eventually found a diamond mine in Africa and became rich. Charley, having heard the commotion, enters. Happy goes off to bed, and Willy and Charley begin to play cards. Charley offers Willy a job, but Willy, insulted, refuses it. As they argue, Willy imagines that Ben enters. Willy accidentally calls Charley Ben. Ben inspects Willy’s house and tells him that he has to catch a train soon to look at properties in Alaska. As Willy talks to Ben about the prospect of going to Alaska, Charley, seeing no one there, gets confused and questions Willy. Willy yells at Charley, who leaves. The younger Linda enters and Ben meets her. Willy asks Ben impatiently about his life. Ben recounts his travels and talks about their father. As Ben is about to leave, Willy daydreams further, and Charley and Bernard rush in to tell him that Biff and Happy are stealing lumber. Although Ben eventually leaves, Willy continues to talk to him.
Back in the present, the older Linda enters to find Willy outside. Biff and Happy come downstairs and discuss Willy’s condition with their mother. Linda scolds Biff for judging Willy harshly. Biff tells her that he knows Willy is a fake, but he refuses to elaborate. Linda mentions that Willy has tried to commit suicide. Happy grows angry and rebukes Biff for his failure in the business world. Willy enters and yells at Biff. Happy intervenes and eventually proposes that he and Biff go into the sporting goods business together. Willy immediately brightens and gives Biff a host of tips about asking for a loan from one of Biff’s old employers, Bill Oliver. After more arguing and reconciliation, everyone finally goes to bed.
Act II opens with Willy enjoying the breakfast that Linda has made for him. Willy ponders the bright-seeming future before getting angry again about his expensive appliances. Linda informs Willy that Biff and Happy are taking him out to dinner that night. Excited, Willy announces that he is going to make Howard Wagner give him a New York job. The phone rings, and Linda chats with Biff, reminding him to be nice to his father at the restaurant that night.
As the lights fade on Linda, they come up on Howard playing with a wire recorder in his office. Willy tries to broach the subject of working in New York, but Howard interrupts him and makes him listen to his kids and wife on the wire recorder. When Willy finally gets a word in, Howard rejects his plea. Willy launches into a lengthy recalling of how a legendary salesman named Dave Singleman inspired him to go into sales. Howard leaves and Willy gets angry. Howard soon re-enters and tells Willy to take some time off. Howard leaves and Ben enters, inviting Willy to join him in Alaska. The younger Linda enters and reminds Willy of his sons and job. The young Biff enters, and Willy praises Biff’s prospects and the fact that he is well liked.
Ben leaves and Bernard rushes in, eagerly awaiting Biff’s big football game. Willy speaks optimistically to Biff about the game. Charley enters and teases Willy about the game. As Willy chases Charley off, the lights rise on a different part of the stage. Willy continues yelling from offstage, and Jenny, Charley’s secretary, asks a grown-up Bernard to quiet him down. Willy enters and prattles on about a “very big deal” that Biff is working on. Daunted by Bernard’s success (he mentions to Willy that he is going to Washington to fight a case), Willy asks Bernard why Biff turned out to be such a failure. Bernard asks Willy what happened in Boston that made Biff decide not to go to summer school. Willy defensively tells Bernard not to blame him.
Charley enters and sees Bernard off. When Willy asks for more money than Charley usually loans him, Charley again offers Willy a job. Willy again refuses and eventually tells Charley that he was fired. Charley scolds Willy for always needing to be liked and angrily gives him the money. Calling Charley his only friend, Willy exits on the verge of tears.
At Frank’s Chop House, Happy helps Stanley, a waiter, prepare a table. They ogle and chat up a girl, Miss Forsythe, who enters the restaurant. Biff enters, and Happy introduces him to Miss Forsythe, continuing to flirt with her. Miss Forsythe, a call girl, leaves to telephone another call girl (at Happy’s request), and Biff spills out that he waited six hours for Bill Oliver and Oliver didn’t even recognize him. Upset at his father’s unrelenting misconception that he, Biff, was a salesman for Oliver, Biff plans to relieve Willy of his illusions. Willy enters, and Biff tries gently, at first, to tell him what happened at Oliver’s office. Willy blurts out that he was fired. Stunned, Biff again tries to let Willy down easily. Happy cuts in with remarks suggesting Biff’s success, and Willy eagerly awaits the good news.
Biff finally explodes at Willy for being unwilling to listen. The young Bernard runs in shouting for Linda, and Biff, Happy, and Willy start to argue. As Biff explains what happened, their conversation recedes into the background. The young Bernard tells Linda that Biff failed math. The restaurant conversation comes back into focus and Willy criticizes Biff for failing math. Willy then hears the voice of the hotel operator in Boston and shouts that he is not in his room. Biff scrambles to quiet Willy and claims that Oliver is talking to his partner about giving Biff the money. Willy’s renewed interest and probing questions irk Biff more, and he screams at Willy. Willy hears The Woman laugh and he shouts back at Biff, hitting him and staggering. Miss Forsythe enters with another call girl, Letta. Biff helps Willy to the washroom and, finding Happy flirting with the girls, argues with him about Willy. Biff storms out, and Happy follows with the girls.
Willy and The Woman enter, dressing themselves and flirting. The door knocks and Willy hurries The Woman into the bathroom. Willy answers the door; the young Biff enters and tells Willy that he failed math. Willy tries to usher him out of the room, but Biff imitates his math teacher’s lisp, which elicits laughter from Willy and The Woman. Willy tries to cover up his indiscretion, but Biff refuses to believe his stories and storms out, dejected, calling Willy a “phony little fake.” Back in the restaurant, Stanley helps Willy up. Willy asks him where he can find a seed store. Stanley gives him directions to one, and Willy hurries off.
The light comes up on the Loman kitchen, where Happy enters looking for Willy. He moves into the living room and sees Linda. Biff comes inside and Linda scolds the boys and slaps away the flowers in Happy’s hand. She yells at them for abandoning Willy. Happy attempts to appease her, but Biff goes in search of Willy. He finds Willy planting seeds in the garden with a flashlight. Willy is consulting Ben about a $20,000 proposition. Biff approaches him to say goodbye and tries to bring him inside. Willy moves into the house, followed by Biff, and becomes angry again about Biff’s failure. Happy tries to calm Biff, but Biff and Willy erupt in fury at each other. Biff starts to sob, which touches Willy. Everyone goes to bed except Willy, who renews his conversation with Ben, elated at how great Biff will be with $20,000 of insurance money. Linda soon calls out for Willy but gets no response. Biff and Happy listen as well. They hear Willy’s car speed away.
In the requiem, Linda and Happy stand in shock after Willy’s poorly attended funeral. Biff states that Willy had the wrong dreams. Charley defends Willy as a victim of his profession. Ready to leave, Biff invites Happy to go back out West with him. Happy declares that he will stick it out in New York to validate Willy’s death. Linda asks Willy for forgiveness for being unable to cry. She begins to sob, repeating “We’re free. . . .” All exit, and the flute melody is heard as the curtain falls."
Clearly,"Anne’s diary begins on her thirteenth birthday, June 12, 1942, and ends shortly after her fifteenth. At the start of her diary, Anne describes fairly typical girlhood experiences, writing about her friendships with other girls, her crushes on boys, and her academic performance at school. Because anti-Semitic laws forced Jews into separate schools, Anne and her older sister, Margot, attended the Jewish Lyceum in Amsterdam.
	The Franks had moved to the Netherlands in the years leading up to World War II to escape persecution in Germany. After the Germans invaded the Netherlands in 1940, the Franks were forced into hiding. With another family, the van Daans, and an acquaintance, Mr. Dussel, they moved into a small secret annex above Otto Frank’s office where they had stockpiled food and supplies. The employees from Otto’s firm helped hide the Franks and kept them supplied with food, medicine, and information about the outside world.
	The residents of the annex pay close attention to every development of the war by listening to the radio. Some bits of news catch Anne’s attention and make their way into her diary, providing a vivid historical context for her personal thoughts. The adults make optimistic bets about when the war will end, and their mood is severely affected by Allied setbacks or German advances. Amsterdam is devastated by the war during the two years the Franks are in hiding. All of the city’s residents suffer, since food becomes scarce and robberies more frequent.
	Anne often writes about her feelings of isolation and loneliness. She has a tumultuous relationship with the adults in the annex, particularly her mother, whom she considers lacking in love and affection. She adores her father, but she is frequently scolded and criticized by Mr. and Mrs. van Daan and Mr. Dussel. Anne thinks that her sister, Margot, is smart, pretty, and agreeable, but she does not feel close to her and does not write much about her. Anne eventually develops a close friendship with Peter van Daan, the teenage boy in the annex. Mr. Frank does not approve, however, and the intensity of Anne’s infatuation begins to lessen.
	Anne matures considerably throughout the course of her diary entries, moving from detailed accounts of basic activities to deeper, more profound thoughts about humanity and her own personal nature. She finds it difficult to understand why the Jews are being singled out and persecuted. Anne also confronts her own identity. Though she considers herself to be German, her German citizenship has been revoked, and though she calls Holland her home, many of the Dutch have turned against the Jews. Anne feels a tremendous solidarity with her aggrieved people, and yet at the same time she wants to be seen as an individual rather than a member of a persecuted group.
During the two years recorded in her diary, Anne deals with confinement and deprivation, as well as the complicated and difficult issues of growing up in the brutal circumstances of the Holocaust. Her diary describes a struggle to define herself within this climate of oppression. Anne’s diary ends without comment on August 1, 1944, the end of a seemingly normal day that leaves us with the expectation of seeing another entry on the next page. However, the Frank family is betrayed to the Nazis and arrested on August 4, 1944. Anne’s diary, the observations of an imaginative, friendly, sometimes petty, and rather normal teenage girl, comes to an abrupt and silent end. 
Otto Frank is the family’s sole survivor, and he recovers Anne’s diary from Miep. He decides to fulfill Anne’s wishes by publishing the diary. Anne’s diary becomes a condemnation of the unimaginable horror of the Holocaust, and one of the few accounts that describe it from a young person’s perspective.
	Since Anne’s diary is a true personal account of a life in hiding, it is inappropriate to analyze it as a novel or other work of fiction. Parts of the diary were intended for public view, but others clearly were not. To appreciate and interpret the diary, it is necessary to consider its horrible context, World War II and the Holocaust, before any discussion of plot development or thematic content."
About,"The Giver is written from the point of view of Jonas, an eleven-year-old boy living in a futuristic society that has eliminated all pain, fear, war, and hatred. There is no prejudice, since everyone looks and acts basically the same, and there is very little competition. Everyone is unfailingly polite. The society has also eliminated choice: at age twelve every member of the community is assigned a job based on his or her abilities and interests. Citizens can apply for and be assigned compatible spouses, and each couple is assigned exactly two children each. The children are born to Birthmothers, who never see them, and spend their first year in a Nurturing Center with other babies, or “newchildren,” born that year. When their children are grown, family units dissolve and adults live together with Childless Adults until they are too old to function in the society. Then they spend their last years being cared for in the House of the Old until they are finally “released” from the society. In the community, release is death, but it is never described that way; most people think that after release, flawed newchildren and joyful elderly people are welcomed into the vast expanse of Elsewhere that surrounds the communities. Citizens who break rules or fail to adapt properly to the society’s codes of behavior are also released, though in their cases it is an occasion of great shame. Everything is planned and organized so that life is as convenient and pleasant as possible.
Jonas lives with his father, a Nurturer of new children, his mother, who works at the Department of Justice, and his seven-year-old sister Lily. At the beginning of the novel, he is apprehensive about the upcoming Ceremony of Twelve, when he will be given his official Assignment as a new adult member of the community. He does not have a distinct career preference, although he enjoys volunteering at a variety of different jobs. Though he is a well-behaved citizen and a good student, Jonas is different: he has pale eyes, while most people in his community have dark eyes, and he has unusual powers of perception. Sometimes objects “change” when he looks at them. He does not know it yet, but he alone in his community can perceive flashes of color; for everyone else, the world is as devoid of color as it is of pain, hunger, and inconvenience.
At the Ceremony of Twelve, Jonas is given the highly honored Assignment of Receiver of Memory. The Receiver is the sole keeper of the community’s collective memory. When the community went over to Sameness—its painless, warless, and mostly emotionless state of tranquility and harmony—it abandoned all memories of pain, war, and emotion, but the memories cannot disappear totally. Someone must keep them so that the community can avoid making the mistakes of the past, even though no one but the Receiver can bear the pain. Jonas receives the memories of the past, good and bad, from the current Receiver, a wise old man who tells Jonas to call him the Giver.
The Giver transmits memories by placing his hands on Jonas’s bare back. The first memory he receives is of an exhilarating sled ride. As Jonas receives memories from the Giver—memories of pleasure and pain, of bright colors and extreme cold and warm sun, of excitement and terror and hunger and love—he realizes how bland and empty life in his community really is. The memories make Jonas’s life richer and more meaningful, and he wishes that he could give that richness and meaning to the people he loves. But in exchange for their peaceful existence, the people of Jonas’s community have lost the capacity to love him back or to feel deep passion about anything. Since they have never experienced real suffering, they also cannot appreciate the real joy of life, and the life of individual people seems less precious to them. In addition, no one in Jonas’s community has ever made a choice of his or her own. Jonas grows more and more frustrated with the members of his community, and the Giver, who has felt the same way for many years, encourages him. The two grow very close, like a grandfather and a grandchild might have in the days before Sameness, when family members stayed in contact long after their children were grown.
Meanwhile, Jonas is helping his family take care of a problem newchild, Gabriel, who has trouble sleeping through the night at the Nurturing Center. Jonas helps the child to sleep by transmitting soothing memories to him every night, and he begins to develop a relationship with Gabriel that mirrors the family relationships he has experienced through the memories. When Gabriel is in danger of being released, the Giver reveals to Jonas that release is the same as death. Jonas’s rage and horror at this revelation inspire the Giver to help Jonas devise a plan to change things in the community forever. The Giver tells Jonas about the girl who had been designated the new Receiver ten years before. She had been the Giver’s own daughter, but the sadness of some of the memories had been too much for her and she had asked to be released. When she died, all of the memories she had accumulated were released into the community, and the community members could not handle the sudden influx of emotion and sensation. The Giver and Jonas plan for Jonas to escape the community and to actually enter Elsewhere. Once he has done that, his larger supply of memories will disperse, and the Giver will help the community to come to terms with the new feelings and thoughts, changing the society forever.
However, Jonas is forced to leave earlier than planned when his father tells him that Gabriel will be released the next day. Desperate to save Gabriel, Jonas steals his father’s bicycle and a supply of food and sets off for Elsewhere. Gradually, he enters a landscape full of color, animals, and changing weather, but also hunger, danger, and exhaustion. Avoiding search planes, Jonas and Gabriel travel for a long time until heavy snow makes bike travel impossible. Half-frozen, but comforting Gabriel with memories of sunshine and friendship, Jonas mounts a high hill. There he finds a sled—the sled from his first transmitted memory—waiting for him at the top. Jonas and Gabriel experience a glorious downhill ride on the sled. Ahead of them, they see—or think they see—the twinkling lights of a friendly village at Christmas, and they hear music. Jonas is sure that someone is waiting for them there."
Governmental,"In Common Sense, Thomas Paine argues for American independence. His argument begins with more general, theoretical reflections about government and religion, then progresses onto the specifics of the colonial situation.
Paine begins by distinguishing between government and society. Society, according to Paine, is everything constructive and good that people join together to accomplish. Government, on the other hand, is an institution whose sole purpose is to protect us from our own vices. Government has its origins in the evil of man and is therefore a necessary evil at best. Paine says that government's sole purpose is to protect life, liberty and property, and that a government should be judged solely on the basis of the extent to which it accomplishes this goal.
Paine then considers an imagined scenario in which a small group of people has been placed on an island, and cut off from the rest of society. In time, these people develop ties with one another, and lawmaking becomes inevitable. Paine says the people will be much happier if they are responsible for the creation of the laws that rule them. Paine is also implicitly arguing that such a system of representation is also better for the American colonists. Having expressed his disagreement with British reign in America, Paine proceeds to launch a general attack on the British system of government. Paine says the British system is too complex and rife with contradictions, and that the monarchy is granted far too much power. The British system pretends to offer a reasonable system of checks and balances, but in fact, it does not.
From here Paine moves on to discuss, in general, the notions of monarchy and hereditary succession. Man, Pain argues, was born into a state of equality, and the distinction that has arisen between king and subject is an unnatural one. At first, Paine says, the world was without kings, but the ancient Jews decided they wanted a king. This angered God, but he allowed them to have one. Paine presents pages of biblical evidence detailing God's wrath at the idea of the Jews having a king. The conclusion Paine reaches is that the practice of monarchy originates from sin, and is an institution that the Bible and God condemn. Paine calls hereditary succession an abominable practice. He says that even if people were to choose to have a king, that does not legitimize that King's child acting as a future ruler. Furthermore, hereditary succession has brought with it innumerable evils, such as incompetent kings, corruption, and civil war.
Having dispensed with the preliminary theoretical issues, Paine sets in to discuss the details of the American situation. In response to the argument that America has flourished under British rule, and therefore ought to stay under the king, Paine says that such an argument fails to realize that America has evolved and no longer needs Britain's help. Some say that Britain has protected America, and therefore deserves allegiance, but Paine responds that Britain has only watched over America in order to secure its own economic well-being. Paine adds that most recently, instead of watching over the colonies, the British have been attacking them, and are therefore undeserving of American loyalty.
Paine says that the colonies have little to gain from remaining attached to Britain. Commerce can be better conducted with the rest of Europe, but only after America becomes independent. Paine also asserts that if the colonies remain attached to Britain, the same problems that have arisen in the past will arise in the future. Paine argues that it is necessary to seek independence now, as to do otherwise would only briefly cover up problems that will surely reemerge.
Paine even proposes the form of government that the independent colonies should adopt. His recommendation is for a representative democracy that gives roughly equal weight to each of the colonies.
Paine explains why the current time is a good time to break free of Britain. Primarily, Paine focuses on the present size of the colonies, and on their current capabilities. He presents an inventory of the British Navy and gives calculations revealing how America could build a navy of comparable size. Paine recommends this as a way of ensuring America's security and prosperity in trade. Paine also argues that America is sufficiently small as to be united now. If time were to elapse, and the population of the colonies to grow, the same feeling of unity would not be present. Paine adds that if the Americans revolt now, they can use the vast expanses of uncharted land to the West in order to pay down some of the debt they will incur.
Paine says that as a colony of Britain, America lacks respectability on the international scene. They are seen simply as rebels, and cannot form substantial alliances with other nations. In order to prosper in the long term, the colonies need to be independent. Paine says that, by declaring independence, America will be able to ask for the help of other countries in its struggle for freedom. For all of these reasons, Paine says it is imperative and urgent that the colonies declare independence."
Consultations,"Susanna Kaysen, an eighteen-year-old in April of 1967, agrees to enter McLean Hospital, a residential psychiatric facility in Massachusetts. Although she plans to stay only a few weeks, Kaysen remains at McLean for nearly two years. The doctor who forcefully advocates her committal to a mental hospital interviewed Kaysen for only twenty minutes.
Kaysen tells the story of the people and experiences she encounters at McLean in a series of nonchronological vignettes. Among the patients admitted to her ward, Kaysen describes Polly, a kind patient with disfiguring, self-inflicted burns to her face and body. Lisa, another patient, entertains Kaysen with her escape attempts and exaggerated contempt for hospital authorities. Kaysen’s roommate, Georgina, struggles to maintain a relationship with Wade, a violent and unstable boyfriend from another ward, who tells the girls seemingly outlandish stories about his father’s exploits with the CIA. The twin obsessions of roasted chicken and laxatives make a newly arrived patient named Daisy the object of much speculation. Daisy ultimately leaves the hospital, only to commit suicide on her birthday.
One day, James Watson, a Nobel laureate and friend of the Kaysen family, visits Kaysen. He offers to take her away from the cold, prisonlike facility, but she rejects the offer, convinced that she should stay the course of her treatment. Kaysen discloses an unsuccessful suicide attempt involving an aspirin overdose in high school. She considers the nature of her illness, which includes difficulty making visual sense of patterns, and wonders whether sanity is merely an illusion that people construct to feel “normal.” Because many famous people have been residents of McLean Hospital, Kaysen speculates that creative minds, especially poets’, may be prone to mental illness.
The hospital’s strict rules dictate patients’ daily routines. Nurses perform “checks,” periodic visual appraisals of a patient’s activities and whereabouts, according to a schedule that corresponds to the severity of the patient’s illness. The staff confiscates any possessions that might inflict injury, even earrings and belts. Field trips outside the hospital walls are rare and require a complex system of patient-to-nurse accompaniment. 
Lisa Cody, a new patient, arrives and threatens the social position of a current resident, also named Lisa, who torments the new girl until she leaves McLean and falls into more desperate circumstances. At this point, Kaysen considers the twenty-minute consultation that resulted in her hospitalization. Analysis of hospital records is inconclusive, and Kaysen’s doubts about the accuracy of her memory leads her into a discussion of the nature of mental illness, which Kaysen believes falls into two categories: slow or “viscous” and fast or having “velocity.” Kaysen believes that both kinds of illness result in the same type of mental paralysis.
Kaysen introduces us to Valerie, the young head nurse, who wins the girls’ respect with her no-nonsense approach to the job and a willingness to stand up to the doctors. Dr. Wick, an older psychiatrist, has trouble relating to the youth culture of her patients and becomes uncomfortable during any discussion of sex. The girls uniformly detest Mrs. McWeeney, the evening nurse, who is decidedly old-fashioned in her dress, speech, and insistence on strict authority. 
The year 1968 is an exciting and frightening year, and Kaysen and the other girls watch its tumultuous events unfold on television. Simply viewing the world’s turbulence temporarily calms them. The girls come to realize that they are sitting on the sidelines of the era’s events and their own lives.
Torrey, a methamphetamine addict from Mexico, arrives on the ward. Torrey’s parents are embarrassed by their daughter’s problems. When Torrey’s parents come to retrieve her, Lisa attempts to help her escape her parents, but Valerie doses Torrey with Thorazine to foil the plan. The other girls fall into a depression. Kaysen suffers an episode of depersonalization that leads her to attempt to tear open her hand to confirm that she has bones beneath the skin.
Kaysen’s wisdom tooth becomes infected, and Valerie takes her from McLean to a dentist in Boston. Kaysen becomes frantic when, upon waking from the general anesthesia, no one will tell her how long she was unconscious. She worries that she has “lost” time. 
A new patient named Alice Calais enters the ward, but a mental breakdown leads to her transfer to maximum security. The girls visit Alice, whose condition and living arrangements sicken them. They vow never to let the same thing happen to them. Kaysen starts sessions with Melvin, a therapist with whom she begins an advanced form of analysis. Enthralled with the tunnels below the hospital, Kaysen struggles to convey their meaning to Melvin. She discovers she is Melvin’s first patient, and then she gladly leaves analysis behind. 
As Kaysen heals, she searches for a job outside the hospital, quickly becoming acquainted with the widespread prejudice that haunts former mental patients. Even applying for telephone service or a driver’s license requires a doctor’s note. Kaysen resumes a relationship she began with a man she knew before entering the hospital and impulsively accepts his marriage proposal. Reflecting on the difference between the mind and the brain, Kaysen wonders whether doctors treat one at the expense of the other. She reveals her diagnosis: borderline personality disorder. Dissecting the medical definition of the disorder, Kaysen notes that it is much more commonly diagnosed in women than in men. She wonders to what degree sexism and psychiatric fads influence the diagnoses. 
Some years after leaving McLean, Kaysen visits Georgina, now married and as eccentric as ever. Kaysen also runs into Lisa, who has a young child and lives in a respectable suburb. Kaysen detects traces of Lisa’s old personality beneath the persona of a suburban mother. In the final chapter, Kaysen reveals the origin of the title of the book, Girl, Interrupted. Separated by some twenty years, Kaysen stands in front of the painting at New York’s Frick Museum. The painting holds very different meanings on each occasion; the changing interpretation reflects Kaysen’s life experience."
Patronage,"The news that a wealthy young gentleman named Charles Bingley has rented the manor of Netherfield Park causes a great stir in the nearby village of Longbourn, especially in the Bennet household. The Bennets have five unmarried daughters—from oldest to youngest, Jane, Elizabeth, Mary, Kitty, and Lydia—and Mrs. Bennet is desperate to see them all married. After Mr. Bennet pays a social visit to Mr. Bingley, the Bennets attend a ball at which Mr. Bingley is present. He is taken with Jane and spends much of the evening dancing with her. His close friend, Mr. Darcy, is less pleased with the evening and haughtily refuses to dance with Elizabeth, which makes everyone view him as arrogant and obnoxious.
At social functions over subsequent weeks, however, Mr. Darcy finds himself increasingly attracted to Elizabeth’s charm and intelligence. Jane’s friendship with Mr. Bingley also continues to burgeon, and Jane pays a visit to the Bingley mansion. On her journey to the house she is caught in a downpour and catches ill, forcing her to stay at Netherfield for several days. In order to tend to Jane, Elizabeth hikes through muddy fields and arrives with a spattered dress, much to the disdain of the snobbish Miss Bingley, Charles Bingley’s sister. Miss Bingley’s spite only increases when she notices that Darcy, whom she is pursuing, pays quite a bit of attention to Elizabeth.
When Elizabeth and Jane return home, they find Mr. Collins visiting their household. Mr. Collins is a young clergyman who stands to inherit Mr. Bennet’s property, which has been “entailed,” meaning that it can only be passed down to male heirs. Mr. Collins is a pompous fool, though he is quite enthralled by the Bennet girls. Shortly after his arrival, he makes a proposal of marriage to Elizabeth. She turns him down, wounding his pride. Meanwhile, the Bennet girls have become friendly with militia officers stationed in a nearby town. Among them is Wickham, a handsome young soldier who is friendly toward Elizabeth and tells her how Darcy cruelly cheated him out of an inheritance.
At the beginning of winter, the Bingleys and Darcy leave Netherfield and return to London, much to Jane’s dismay. A further shock arrives with the news that Mr. Collins has become engaged to Charlotte Lucas, Elizabeth’s best friend and the poor daughter of a local knight. Charlotte explains to Elizabeth that she is getting older and needs the match for financial reasons. Charlotte and Mr. Collins get married and Elizabeth promises to visit them at their new home. As winter progresses, Jane visits the city to see friends (hoping also that she might see Mr. Bingley). However, Miss Bingley visits her and behaves rudely, while Mr. Bingley fails to visit her at all. The marriage prospects for the Bennet girls appear bleak.
That spring, Elizabeth visits Charlotte, who now lives near the home of Mr. Collins’s patron, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, who is also Darcy’s aunt. Darcy calls on Lady Catherine and encounters Elizabeth, whose presence leads him to make a number of visits to the Collins’s home, where she is staying. One day, he makes a shocking proposal of marriage, which Elizabeth quickly refuses. She tells Darcy that she considers him arrogant and unpleasant, then scolds him for steering Bingley away from Jane and disinheriting Wickham. Darcy leaves her but shortly thereafter delivers a letter to her. In this letter, he admits that he urged Bingley to distance himself from Jane, but claims he did so only because he thought their romance was not serious. As for Wickham, he informs Elizabeth that the young officer is a liar and that the real cause of their disagreement was Wickham’s attempt to elope with his young sister, Georgiana Darcy.
This letter causes Elizabeth to reevaluate her feelings about Darcy. She returns home and acts coldly toward Wickham. The militia is leaving town, which makes the younger, rather man-crazy Bennet girls distraught. Lydia manages to obtain permission from her father to spend the summer with an old colonel in Brighton, where Wickham’s regiment will be stationed. With the arrival of June, Elizabeth goes on another journey, this time with the Gardiners, who are relatives of the Bennets. The trip takes her to the North and eventually to the neighborhood of Pemberley, Darcy’s estate. She visits Pemberley, after making sure that Darcy is away, and delights in the building and grounds, while hearing from Darcy’s servants that he is a wonderful, generous master. Suddenly, Darcy arrives and behaves cordially toward her. Making no mention of his proposal, he entertains the Gardiners and invites Elizabeth to meet his sister.
Shortly thereafter, however, a letter arrives from home, telling Elizabeth that Lydia has eloped with Wickham and that the couple is nowhere to be found, which suggests that they may be living together out of wedlock. Fearful of the disgrace such a situation would bring on her entire family, Elizabeth hastens home. Mr. Gardiner and Mr. Bennet go off to search for Lydia, but Mr. Bennet eventually returns home empty-handed. Just when all hope seems lost, a letter comes from Mr. Gardiner saying that the couple has been found and that Wickham has agreed to marry Lydia in exchange for an annual income. The Bennets are convinced that Mr. Gardiner has paid off Wickham, but Elizabeth learns that the source of the money, and of her family’s salvation, was none other than Darcy.
Now married, Wickham and Lydia return to Longbourn briefly, where Mr. Bennet treats them coldly. They then depart for Wickham’s new assignment in the North of England. Shortly thereafter, Bingley returns to Netherfield and resumes his courtship of Jane. Darcy goes to stay with him and pays visits to the Bennets but makes no mention of his desire to marry Elizabeth. Bingley, on the other hand, presses his suit and proposes to Jane, to the delight of everyone but Bingley’s haughty sister. While the family celebrates, Lady Catherine de Bourgh pays a visit to Longbourn. She corners Elizabeth and says that she has heard that Darcy, her nephew, is planning to marry her. Since she considers a Bennet an unsuitable match for a Darcy, Lady Catherine demands that Elizabeth promise to refuse him. Elizabeth spiritedly refuses, saying she is not engaged to Darcy, but she will not promise anything against her own happiness. A little later, Elizabeth and Darcy go out walking together and he tells her that his feelings have not altered since the spring. She tenderly accepts his proposal, and both Jane and Elizabeth are married."
Guide,"Arthur Dent awakes one day to find a demolition crew outside his house, preparing to bulldoze it down to make way for a new bypass. He throws himself down in front of the bulldozer to try to stop the demolition. Shortly after, his friend Ford Prefect arrives, suggests he has something very important to tell Arthur, and convinces him to leave his desperate protest and get a drink. Ford is secretly from a small planet near Betelgeuse and works as a researcher for The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, a quirky galactic repository of knowledge. 
Ford has discovered that a Vogon Constructor fleet is heading toward Earth to destroy it to make way for a galactic bypass. The fleet arrives, causing mass chaos on Earth. Its leader, Prostetnic Jeltz, announces that Earth has been scheduled for demolition and unceremoniously destroys it. Ford manages to hitch a ride for himself and Arthur on Jeltz’s starship, where Arthur learns about Ford’s true origins, The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, and the usefulness of towels. A search party soon arrives and takes Ford and Arthur to Jeltz, who doesn’t like hitchhikers. Jeltz delights in watching Ford and Arthur suffer while he reads them his poetry and forces them to critique it. Ford and Arthur’s critiques disappoint Jeltz, and he orders them to be thrown out an airlock. Ford and Arthur are, against the odds, picked up by a starship called the Heart of Gold a second before they suffocate in the vacuum of space.
The two-headed, three-armed, impetuous Zaphod Beeblebrox became Galactic President to steal the Heart of Gold and its unique Infinite Improbability Drive, a propulsion system that allows the starship to travel through all points in the galaxy in less than a second. Zaphod is accompanied by Trillian, a young woman from Earth whom Arthur once tried to pick up at a party. The Heart of Gold is equipped with a depressed robot named Marvin and controlled by a cheerful computer named Eddie. The starship’s drive creates a wake of improbability when it is activated, and for this reason, the Heart of Gold picked up Ford and Arthur on its own. Ford and Arthur awake onboard the starship and experience several impossibly strange events. When normality is reestablished, Zaphod sends Marvin to bring Ford and Arthur to the bridge, where Zaphod and Ford recognize each other: The two are semi-cousins and close friends. Arthur recognizes Zaphod as Phil, the man who spirited Tricia McMillian, now known as Trillian, away from him at a party six months earlier.
The Infinite Improbability Drive brings the crew to Magrathea, a legendary planet that had once designed custom planets for the galaxy’s wealthiest inhabitants. The starship begins to descend to the planet’s surface, which triggers the planetary defense system, launching two nuclear missiles at the Heart of Gold. Despite taking evasive action, the starship cannot outrun the missiles. At the last second, Arthur turns on the Infinite Improbability Drive in the hope of avoiding certain death, and the missiles turn into a bowl of petunias and a sperm whale. The Heart of Gold lands on Magrathea, where Zaphod discovers an entrance into Magrathea’s interior. Leaving Arthur and Marvin to stand guard, Zaphod, Trillian, and Ford search the tunnels, where Zaphod explains that he discovered that he tampered with his own memories to prevent himself from realizing why he wanted to find Magrathea. A door suddenly slams down, trapping the group. The tunnel fills with gas, and Zaphod, Ford, and Trillian pass out.
While standing guard, Arthur encounters Slartibartfast, a Magrathean. The two travel in an aircar to Slartibartfast’s office, where he reveals that Earth was an organic supercomputer designed by a pandimensional race and built by the Magratheans. Millions of years ago, an alien race created a supercomputer named Deep Thought, which was given the single purpose of figuring out the answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything. At the end of its seven-and-a-half-million-year program, Deep Thought reveals that the answer is “forty-two.” 
Sensing the disappointment from this answer, Deep Thought builds an organic computer to discover the true Ultimate Question, which will hopefully make sense of the answer. This new organic computer was Earth, but it was destroyed by the Vogons mere minutes before it completed its ten-million-year task. 
Slartibartfast continues to explain that Magrathea has been awakened to build a second Earth—Earth Mark Two—and that the pandimensional beings who commissioned the creation of the original Earth manifest in Arthur’s dimension as mice.
Upon awaking, Zaphod recalls a missing memory. He explains that Yooden Vranx, the Galactic President before Zaphod, suggested that Zaphod become Galactic President and steal the Heart of Gold. Zaphod, Ford, and Trillian are then taken to meet the mice, where they will soon reunite with Arthur. Frankie mouse and Benjy mouse explain to Arthur that the question they have waited ten million years for may reside in his brain, and they offer to buy it from him. Arthur refuses, and Frankie and Benjy try to take the answer by force as alarms sound and chaos ensues. Barely escaping from the mice, Arthur, Ford, Trillian, and Zaphod search for a way out of Magrathea. 
Meanwhile, Frankie and Benjy come up with a plausible lie to sell to the rest of their pandimensional species. After Zaphod stole the Heart of Gold, two Blagulon Kappa police officers tracked him to Magrathea and enter the planet’s interior attempting to apprehend him. The officers corner Zaphod, Ford, Arthur, and Trillian in a computer room and shoot at them. Suddenly, both officers drop dead. Their life support systems inexplicably exploded.
Zaphod, Ford, Arthur, and Trillian make it back to the Heart of Gold and Marvin, who’s been lying on the ground, depressed. The group boards the starship, leaves Magrathea, and heads to the Restaurant at the End of the Universe to get something to eat."
Comities,"Lawyer Bryan Stevenson gives a first-person account of his decades helping marginalized Americans who have been unfairly and harshly punished by the U.S. criminal justice system, which disproportionately targets people of color and poor people. At the heart of Just Mercy is the story of Walter McMillian, a Black man who was framed for the murder of a girl named Ronda Morrison, convicted, and sent to death row. 
Stevenson alternates chapters about Walter with his personal reflections on our country’s history with racial disparity and issues around incarceration. Stevenson highlights other groups of vulnerable people who have been victimized by the criminal justice system and shares the stories of the prisoners he has helped over the years. The book also follows the growth of Stevenson’s nonprofit law project, the Alabama-based Equal Justice Initiative (EJI), through its expansion from focusing on death row prisoners to helping people sentenced to life without parole. Stevenson chronicles how EJI becomes a significant force in criminal justice reform.
In 1983 as a law student, Stevenson discovers his life’s passion when he interns with the Georgia-based Southern Prisoners Defense Committee and meets his first death row prisoner. After graduation Stevenson accepts a job with the organization to represent poor prisoners, including those in Alabama who lack any public defender. He meets Walter McMillian on Alabama’s death row. Walter owns a successful business but also transgresses racial boundaries when he has an affair with a white woman. Soon after the affair becomes public, the woman’s friend, Ralph Myers, accuses Walter of committing the unsolved murder of Ronda Morrison, which has outraged the community. Law enforcement, including a racist sheriff and the district attorney, eagerly pounces on this accusation, overlooking Walter’s alibi and a lack of evidence. Instead, they actively force Ralph to stick with his story even when he tries to recant. They coerce other false witness testimonies, and—as revealed years later—actively suppress evidence.
After Stevenson and the team at EJI unsuccessfully appeal Walter’s conviction, they launch their own investigation of the crime and uncover new evidence. They find witnesses who can prove the witnesses against Walter lied as well as financial records that indicate that one of these witnesses was paid to give false testimony. Stevenson and his team also petition for and receive all records from Walter’s trial. However, their big break comes when they receive a phone call from Ralph, who now wants to make amends. Ralph admits to lying about Walter and says he was threatened by law enforcement. Stevenson wins a hearing for Walter where he can present his new evidence: Ralph’s testimony, which is confirmed by health care workers and other inmates, as well as recordings of the law enforcement team threatening Ralph if he doesn’t frame Walter. 
While the judge refuses to grant Walter relief, Stevenson continues the appeal process through the Alabama courts. The district attorney asks outside agents to investigate the murder for which Walter was convicted, and the investigators determine that Walter had nothing to do with the crime. Six weeks later, the court invalidates Walter’s conviction. Stevenson and the State file a joint motion to dismiss the charges, and Walter is set free.
Throughout the process, Stevenson and Walter become close friends, and Stevenson helps Walter upon his release, including filing a civil suit on his behalf and offering him a place to stay. Walter works with Stevenson to share his story, giving interviews and speaking at legal conferences, and Walter is even featured in a documentary. Unfortunately, Walter is diagnosed with advancing dementia and is forced to rely on family and eventually a nursing facility for his care. He dies in 2013. Stevenson gives a eulogy at his funeral and shares all he learned from Walter, particularly that we must extend mercy to everyone, even those who have not earned it.
Interspersed with chapters chronicling Walter’s narrative are stories of Stevenson’s other clients and work. His closeness with these prisoners and their horrifying circumstances makes Stevenson more determined to help and causes him to reflect on abstract issues that nevertheless imbue the criminal justice system, like humanity and mercy. Stevenson focuses on several categories of vulnerable people who become trapped in the system, including mentally ill prisoners, disabled prisoners, and poor women who give birth to stillborn babies. 
Stevenson and his team at EJI also become increasingly focused on juvenile offenders who are sometimes tried as adults despite their young age. These offenders may be given de facto death sentences by being sentenced to life without parole and face perilous circumstances when they are housed in adult prisons. Stevenson illustrates how these prisoners retain their own humanity while being forced to live under inhumane conditions. He also discusses some of the qualities common among these types of prisoners: They are generally poor and disproportionately people of color, and most of them lack adequate legal counsel. The juveniles have horrific backgrounds of abuse and neglect.
Stevenson and his team at EJI also work to change the legal system to offer more protection to marginalized people. Several of his cases end up before the U.S. Supreme Court, and he succeeds in winning rulings that ban as unconstitutional the conviction of children to life without parole and the execution of people deemed incompetent from dementia or neurological disease. EJI works to raise public awareness of issues surrounding unfair incarceration, produces groundbreaking reports on racial issues, and sets up programs to help formerly incarcerated people adjust to life on the outside.
Stevenson also reflects on the issues that surround the criminal justice system. His time spent with prisoners awaiting their execution makes him realize how inhumane it is to prepare another human to die. After decades of work, when Stevenson fails to prevent the execution of a man who suffers from an intellectual disability, he momentarily feels unable to continue his work. However, he realizes that he cannot help but be broken by his experiences and comes to understand that it is his own brokenness that allows him to more fully understand the need for mercy and to bring compassion to others. The book ends with Stevenson’s renewed commitment to helping others."
Spain,"At the age of four, Catalina de Erauso, born in the Basque area of Spain in 1585, is placed in a Dominican convent, where she trains until the age of fifteen to become a nun. On March 18, 1600, Catalina runs away from the convent and fashions herself a suit of male clothes out of her convent garments. Thus she begins her life as a man.
She obtains a number of jobs, including one as a page for the king’s secretary. While in his employ, she encounters her father, who is petitioning for help in finding his missing daughter. Her father does not recognize her. She again tempts fate and returns to her old convent for mass, where her mother is in attendance. Catalina’s mother also does not recognize her.
Catalina’s journeys through the New World begin when she meets her uncle, a sea captain who, not recognizing her, signs her on as a ship’s boy. Eventually Catalina flees the ship, stealing money from her uncle as she leaves for Panama, and embarks on a series of jobs and adventures. A number of violent episodes ensue, which often lead Catalina to flee into a local church for safety. At that time, police were barred from invading the sanctity of a church, thus granting criminals inside sanctuary. Catalina’s tendency to get into violent and criminal scrapes leads her to take frequent advantage of this legal loophole.
Catalina also has a number of problematic encounters with young ladies. Some want to marry her, forcing her to ward off their advances. But in one situation, Catalina is dismissed from her position for inappropriate behavior with the sister-in-law of her master. She signs up for the army and soon travels to Chile, where she becomes a soldier for her brother, who does not recognize her. Although they generally get along well, after three years they fight over a woman, and Catalina is banished to another town. She manages to distinguish herself in battle, both for her bravery and for her propensity for violence. She kills many people, both on and off the battlefield, and is constantly running from the law.
When a friend asks her to be his second in a duel, she agrees. During the course of the duel, she kills the other man’s second, who turns out to be her own brother. She retreats to the church to avoid arrest, and from there, wracked with sorrow, she watches her brother’s funeral. After months of hiding out in the church, Catalina leaves town and joins up with two other army deserters, who eventually die of starvation during their journey. Catalina is rescued by a half-Indian woman who wants Catalina to marry her daughter. At the same time, a local vicar tries to persuade her to marry his niece. Although she accepts their gifts, she eventually abandons them both.
Catalina assists in suppressing the Alonso Ibáñezi uprising and is part of a bloody battle where thousands of Indians are butchered. She is accused of committing a crime that she is innocent of, and although she is tortured, she refuses to admit to it. Soon after, she is accused of a murder that she actually has committed, but she refuses to admit to this crime either. She is nearly put to death until a fellow Basque halts the execution.
In Bolivia, the daughter of a nun begs Catalina to help her escape her husband, who is about to kill her for infidelity. The husband then tries to kill them both, but Catalina gets the woman to the safety of her mother’s convent. Catalina then goes to Peru to investigate crimes in the area. Soon after, she kills a man for insulting her and is sentenced to death. Due to a technicality in the church doctrine, she gains her freedom by taking communion and spitting it into her hand, holding onto the host until she is taken into a church, where she is granted sanctuary.
In Lima, she joins Spanish troops who are being attacked by the Dutch and then returns to the city of Cuzco, where she gets into a bloody fight over a game of cards. She kills her opponent, “the Cid,” who inflicts serious wounds on her as well. Thinking she is going to die, she makes a full confession to a priest.
Although she survives, she is wanted by the law. Her brushes with the constables grow more and more dangerous, and she is eventually surrounded by officers who have been given orders to kill her. A bishop intervenes and takes Catalina into the safety of his house. Catalina finally admits to the bishop that she is a woman, and when he expresses doubts, she gamely offers to submit to a medical examination. During the examination, she is proven to be not only a woman but a virgin, and the bishop vows to help her.
She is sent to a nunnery while the church investigates her past to find out if she ever took vows to become a nun. Her story spreads far and wide, and by 1620 she is well known throughout Spain. When, two years later, it is confirmed that she never took her vows, she is allowed to leave the convent and begin her life as a Spanish celebrity. She goes to Madrid and presents herself to the king, who, in 1625, grants her a pension for her service to Spain.
Catalina travels to Rome, where she meets Pope Urban the Eighth and tells him about her life and travels. She tells him that she is a woman and a virgin, and he gives her permission to continue to dress in men’s clothing.
Catalina ends her memoir with a short tale about being confronted by two prostitutes, whom she insults because they address her as a woman."
Disregards,"Divergent is set in the future, in a dystopian version of Chicago that has been divided into five factions: Abnegation, Candor, Amity, Dauntless, and Erudite. The protagonist and narrator is a sixteen-year-old girl from Abnegation named Beatrice Prior.
The novel opens with Beatrice’s mother cutting her hair. Beatrice is worried about the next day’s aptitude test, which is administered to all sixteen-year-olds and will tell her which of the factions she is best suited for. After the test, she will attend the Choosing Ceremony, where she must decide whether to stay in her family’s faction or leave it behind.
Beatrice is sure that her brother Caleb will stay in Abnegation, which values selflessness and humility above all else, but she is conflicted. She has a strong desire to join Dauntless, the faction whose members value bravery. Trying to ignore her feelings, she goes in for her aptitude test, which is administered by a Dauntless woman named Tori. Tori injects Beatrice with a serum that initiates a series of simulations to which Beatrice must respond. After the test is over, Tori leaves the room looking concerned. When she returns, she tells Beatrice she is suited for multiple factions, meaning she’s what’s known as Divergent. Tori warns her not to tell anyone, and Beatrice returns home wondering what her results mean. At dinner that night, she tries to hide her conflicted feelings from her parents and brother.
The following day, all the families of sixteen-year-olds attend the Choosing Ceremony. Beatrice’s entire family is shocked when Caleb picks Erudite. After some hesitation, Beatrice chooses Dauntless. She leaves the building and jumps onto a train with the other initiates, where she meets Christina and Will, who will become her good friends. When they arrive at the Dauntless compound, a boy named Peter insults her. She responds by being the first person to jump into the Pit, Dauntless’s headquarters seven stories below. After a boy named Four helps her up, she introduces herself as Tris. The initiates proceed to the dining hall and Tris meets Eric, the ruthless head trainer of initiates. The next day, Eric tells the trainees that initiation consists of a three-stage ranking process. Those who rank high enough will become members, while the rest will become factionless. Tris vows to succeed and performs well on the first day of stage one, which involves shooting guns at targets. That night, Christina outfits Tris with flattering clothes and makeup, and she gets three birds tattooed on her collarbone to represent her family.
Next, the initiates must fight each other in an arena and try to knock each other unconscious. When Christina concedes to her opponent, Eric forces her to hang over a chasm in the Pit for five minutes as punishment. The following day, Tris finds that Peter has spray painted the word “Stiff” all over her bed. He also beats her in that day’s fight, sending her to the infirmary. She begins having doubts about her place in her new faction, and her worries intensify during a field trip to the compound wall to learn about Dauntless jobs. Late that night, Eric and Four take the initiates to Navy Pier, an abandoned park in the city, to play capture the flag. As Tris and Four climb a Ferris wheel so they can see where the other team is hiding, Tris realizes she’s starting to like him. She leads their team to victory, impressing Four and angering Eric. The following day, Tris’s friend Al performs badly during a knife-throwing exercise, and Eric orders him to stand in front of the target while others throw knives at him. Tris offers to take Al’s place, and Four throws knives around her head, nicking her ear.
Peter and his friends Molly and Drew continue to torment Tris. After they steal her towel and mock her naked body, she takes revenge by beating Molly up during their assigned fight. Tris finds comfort in her mother’s presence on Visiting Day, but the reunion is marred when Will’s sister accuses Tris’s former faction of hoarding food and goods. Taking Tris aside, her mother asks about her rankings and tells her to convince Caleb to research the simulation serum. The conversation makes Tris realize her mother must have come from Dauntless. Back in the dorm, Al puts his arm around Tris, but she rebuffs him. Later that evening, the rankings show that Tris in sixth place and Peter in second. That night, Edward, who placed first, gets stabbed in the eye, presumably by a jealous Peter. Tris is happy for a distraction the next day, when she gets invited to zip line off the top of the Hancock building with the Dauntless-born initiates.
In the second stage of initiation, the initiates are injected with a serum that induces a fear simulation. After Tris’s first simulation, Four informs her she was able to escape the test much faster than anyone else. Still, she is stressed about the tests and angry at Peter, who’s been distributing Erudite reports accusing Abnegation of corruption. After another trip to the tattoo parlor, she flirts with a drunken Four. During her next simulation, she escapes the hallucination by manipulating it, leading Four to realize she’s Divergent. He warns her not to share her status with anyone. She again talks with Tori, who tells Tris that Dauntless leaders killed her brother when they learned he was Divergent.
Because she’s able to manipulate the simulations, Tris ranks first after stage two, leading Peter to threaten her. One night, as she gets a drink of water in the hallway, she hears Eric talking with an unknown woman about Divergent rebels. Suddenly, she’s attacked from behind and taken to the chasm by Peter, Drew, and Al. One of the boys gropes her chest, and Peter nearly drops her over the edge before Four rescues her. As she recovers in Four’s private room, he advises Tris to feign weakness to stay safe, and they grow closer.
The next day, Tris refuses to accept Al’s apologies, and he commits suicide a few hours later by jumping into the chasm. At his funeral, Eric calls him brave, making Tris angry. She vents loudly about Dauntless’s warped priorities to Four, who warns her that she’s being watched. Frustrated and confused, she blows off steam with her friends by throwing stacks of Erudite reports into the chasm.
During stage three, the initiates are forced to confront all their worst fears in a simulation, but this time everyone knows the scenarios are made up, not just Tris. Tris follows Four up to the fear simulation room, where he sometimes goes to practice facing his phobias. He invites Tris into his simulation, and she learns he has only four fears. One of them is his father Marcus, who is Tris’s father’s colleague. After Tris helps Four through each scenario, he asks her to call him by his real name, Tobias, and they kiss.
The following day, Tobias ignores Tris in public, upsetting her. The initiates must go through a sample fear scenario, and Tris panics during hers, causing Tobias to rebuke her. She slaps him and leaves the Dauntless compound to see her brother Caleb in Erudite. When she finds him, he expresses loyalty to Erudite, angering her. She tells him their mother wants him to research the simulation serum, and then is taken by two men to see Jeanine, the Erudite leader. Jeanine asks probing questions about Tris’s test results, and Tris lies hide her Divergence. Back at Dauntless, when Eric threatens her with punishment for leaving, she and Tobias pretend she was sulking because Tobias rejected her. That night, Tobias takes Tris into the city and shows her that Erudite’s lights are on, a major rule violation. He has discovered that Erudite is planning a war against Abnegation, though he’s not sure how Dauntless is involved.
For the final test, each trainee goes through their fear simulation in front of a panel of judges, with the other initiates watching on screens. During Tris’s simulation, she realizes she needs to feel a sense of control in order to escape. Her creative thinking helps her manage her fears of crows, drowning, burning at the stake, kidnapping, and sex. Lastly, instead of following orders to shoot everyone in her family, she offers to sacrifice her own life. Afterward, Eric congratulates her on passing the test and informs her that all Dauntless members must be fitted with a tracking device. Though she’s suspicious, she allows him to inject her with the tracking serum. Back in Tobias’s room, Tris expresses her worries about sex, and she and Tobias agree they’re not ready for it. They go to the banquet, where Tris learns she’s placed first in the rankings. As she and Tobias kiss, she suddenly realizes the Erudite must be planning to use the tracking devices to control the Dauntless.
Tris doesn’t have time to share her realization with Tobias, and in the middle of the night, she awakens to find everyone leaving the dorm in a trance. Since she’s Divergent, the serum hasn’t worked on her, but she follows the group onto a train. There, she discovers Tobias is also awake, meaning he’s Divergent too. When they arrive at Abnegation, the Dauntless begin shooting everyone in sight. After she stops Eric from killing Tobias, Tris gets shot in the shoulder. She and Tobias are taken to Jeanine, who explains her plot to take over the government. She injects Tobias with a serum that makes him attack Tris. He’s sent away, while Tris is knocked unconscious.
Tris wakes up in a glass box filling slowly with water, just like in her simulations. Before she can drown, her mother appears and saves Tris’s life. Her mother is killed by Dauntless soldiers shortly afterward, and Tris kills Will in the process of escaping. She finds her father and brother hiding with other Abnegation members, including Marcus, Tobias’s father. They treat her wound, then head toward the control room at Dauntless headquarters. Tris leads her family into the Pit, where she finds Peter acting as a guard. Tris forces Peter to lead them to the control room, and her father is killed in the process of helping her. She finds Tobias, still under the influence of Jeanine’s serum, manning the computer program. They struggle to get each other’s weapons, and after she lets Tobias take her gun, she pleads with him to see her. He comes out of his trance and stops the computer program. Taking the hard drive with them, they reunite with Caleb and Marcus, then jump on a train heading toward Amity headquarters. Tris notices that Marcus seems interested in the hard drive and wonders what will happen next."
Erect,"Thomas Gradgrind, a wealthy, retired merchant in the industrial city of Coketown, England, devotes his life to a philosophy of rationalism, self-interest, and fact. He raises his oldest children, Louisa and Tom, according to this philosophy and never allows them to engage in fanciful or imaginative pursuits. He founds a school and charitably takes in one of the students, the kindly and imaginative Sissy Jupe, after the disappearance of her father, a circus entertainer.
	As the Gradgrind children grow older, Tom becomes a dissipated, self-interested hedonist, and Louisa struggles with deep inner confusion, feeling as though she is missing something important in her life. Eventually Louisa marries Gradgrind’s friend Josiah Bounderby, a wealthy factory owner and banker more than twice her age. Bounderby continually trumpets his role as a self-made man who was abandoned in the gutter by his mother as an infant. Tom is apprenticed at the Bounderby bank, and Sissy remains at the Gradgrind home to care for the younger children.
	In the meantime, an impoverished “Hand”—Dickens’s term for the lowest laborers in Coketown’s factories—named Stephen Blackpool struggles with his love for Rachael, another poor factory worker. He is unable to marry her because he is already married to a horrible, drunken woman who disappears for months and even years at a time. Stephen visits Bounderby to ask about a divorce but learns that only the wealthy can obtain them. Outside Bounderby’s home, he meets Mrs. Pegler, a strange old woman with an inexplicable devotion to Bounderby.
	James Harthouse, a wealthy young sophisticate from London, arrives in Coketown to begin a political career as a disciple of Gradgrind, who is now a Member of Parliament. He immediately takes an interest in Louisa and decides to try to seduce her. With the unspoken aid of Mrs. Sparsit, a former aristocrat who has fallen on hard times and now works for Bounderby, he sets about trying to corrupt Louisa.
	The Hands, exhorted by a crooked union spokesman named Slackbridge, try to form a union. Only Stephen refuses to join because he feels that a union strike would only increase tensions between employers and employees. He is cast out by the other Hands and fired by Bounderby when he refuses to spy on them. Louisa, impressed with Stephen’s integrity, visits him before he leaves Coketown and helps him with some money. Tom accompanies her and tells Stephen that if he waits outside the bank for several consecutive nights, help will come to him. Stephen does so, but no help arrives. Eventually he packs up and leaves Coketown, hoping to find agricultural work in the country. Not long after that, the bank is robbed, and the lone suspect is Stephen, the vanished Hand who was seen loitering outside the bank for several nights just before disappearing from the city.
	Mrs. Sparsit witnesses Harthouse declaring his love for Louisa, and Louisa agrees to meet him in Coketown later that night. However, Louisa instead flees to her father’s house, where she miserably confides to Gradgrind that her upbringing has left her married to a man she does not love, disconnected from her feelings, deeply unhappy, and possibly in love with Harthouse. She collapses to the floor, and Gradgrind, struck dumb with self-reproach, begins to realize the imperfections in his philosophy of rational self-interest.
	Sissy, who loves Louisa deeply, visits Harthouse and convinces him to leave Coketown forever. Bounderby, furious that his wife has left him, redoubles his efforts to capture Stephen. When Stephen tries to return to clear his good name, he falls into a mining pit called Old Hell Shaft. Rachael and Louisa discover him, but he dies soon after an emotional farewell to Rachael. Gradgrind and Louisa realize that Tom is really responsible for robbing the bank, and they arrange to sneak him out of England with the help of the circus performers with whom Sissy spent her early childhood. They are nearly successful, but are stopped by Bitzer, a young man who went to Gradgrind’s school and who embodies all the qualities of the detached rationalism that Gradgrind once espoused, but who now sees its limits. Sleary, the lisping circus proprietor, arranges for Tom to slip out of Bitzer’s grasp, and the young robber escapes from England after all.
	Mrs. Sparsit, anxious to help Bounderby find the robbers, drags Mrs. Pegler—a known associate of Stephen Blackpool—in to see Bounderby, thinking Mrs. Pegler is a potential witness. Bounderby recoils, and it is revealed that Mrs. Pegler is really his loving mother, whom he has forbidden to visit him: Bounderby is not a self-made man after all. Angrily, Bounderby fires Mrs. Sparsit and sends her away to her hostile relatives. Five years later, he will die alone in the streets of Coketown. Gradgrind gives up his philosophy of fact and devotes his political power to helping the poor. Tom realizes the error of his ways but dies without ever seeing his family again. While Sissy marries and has a large and loving family, Louisa never again marries and never has children. Nevertheless, Louisa is loved by Sissy’s family and learns at last how to feel sympathy for her fellow human beings."
Mormon,"Part I opens in the late 1800s. Dr. John Watson, a British surgeon, gets injured in the Afghan War. Upon his return to London, he needs a new home and, after bumping into a former colleague, makes the acquaintance of Sherlock Holmes. The two men rent rooms together at 221B Baker Street. Since Watson is in ill health and doesn’t go out much, he focuses on Holmes. He notices that Holmes knows a great deal about a narrow range of topics but is virtually ignorant of numerous subjects. One morning, Watson makes fun of an article about the powers of observation, only to learn that Holmes wrote the article and that he works as a consulting detective.
When Scotland Yard detective Tobias Gregson asks Holmes for help in solving a mysterious death, Watson and Holmes immediately head to the scene of the crime, a vacant house in Brixton. There they meet Gregson and another detective, Lestrade. They examine the body of a dead American named Drebber. Holmes inspects the room for clues, which he uses to determine specific details about the murderer. 
Watson and Holmes leave the house and visit the constable who discovered the body. They learn that a drunk man was the only bystander. Holmes deduces that this man was actually the murderer, who had come back for the wedding ring found at the scene of the crime. Hoping to catch the murderer, Holmes places an ad in the paper for the lost ring. That night, an old woman arrives to claim the ring. Holmes follows her but loses her trail, telling Watson that she was really a young man in disguise.
The next day, news of the murder fills the paper. Watson and Holmes read that Drebber had been traveling with his secretary, Stangerson, but both men disappeared. Gregson arrives at the flat and announces that he has just arrested a man for Drebber’s murder – the son of the landlady of the boardinghouse where Drebber stayed. Gregson adds that Drebber, who often drank to excess, had been thrown out of the boardinghouse for making advances on the landlady’s daughter, and the son had followed him, so naturally, he must have killed Drebber. 
Lestrade then arrives with his own news. Lestrade explains that he tracked Stangerson to a hotel and found him stabbed to death in his bed. When Holmes asks about Stangerson’s possessions, Lestrade turns over a box that contains two pills. Using a sick dog as a test, Holmes demonstrates that one of the pills is benign and the other contains a deadly poison. Holmes explains that he knows the identity of the murderer but still needs to locate him. Moments later, a cab arrives for Holmes. When the driver comes upstairs, Holmes handcuffs him. The men foil the prisoner’s escape effort and plan to take him to Scotland Yard.
Part II opens in the American West in 1847. A starving man journeys across a barren desert. He stops and sets down his bundle: a young girl. They are the only survivors of a party of twenty-one immigrants, but they have now run out of food and water. After they fall asleep, expecting to die, an enormous caravan of Mormon travelers appears. The Mormons discover the man and girl, who are John Ferrier and his adopted daughter, Lucy. The Mormon leader, Brigham Young, offers Ferrier and Lucy refuge as long as they adopt their religion.
Twelve years pass, and Ferrier and Lucy have settled outside Salt Lake City, a city built and populated by the Mormons. Ferrier owns a prosperous farm. Lucy is a beautiful young woman. She and Jefferson Hope, a miner and pioneer, fall in love, but Hope has to leave town for two months. While Hope is gone, the Mormon leader announces that Lucy must wed the son of one of the Mormon Elders, but he’ll grant her one month to choose which son. Not wanting Lucy to marry a Mormon, Ferrier immediately sends a message to Hope. The same day, two young men, Drebber and Stangerson, present their case to Ferrier. They argue over who has a greater claim to Lucy, and Ferrier orders them to leave.
At the end of the month, Hope finally comes to the rescue. Ferrier and Lucy flee with him. They evade the Mormon sentries posted around Ferrier’s farm and make it to the base of the mountains, where Hope has animals waiting to carry them to safety. They soon run out of food. When Hope returns from hunting, he finds the camp empty. He finds Ferrier’s freshly dug grave nearby and realizes the Mormons have taken Lucy back to Salt Lake City. Vowing vengeance, Hope retraces his path and arrives at Salt Lake City the day after Lucy has been wed to Drebber. She dies a month later, and Hope visits her body, taking the wedding ring from her finger. 
Hope retreats to the mountains and attempts to kill Drebber and Stangerson, but he fails and retreats to Nevada. When Hope returns five years later, Drebber and Stangerson have left the community. Hope travels around the country in search of the men. Many years later, he spots Drebber in Ohio. But Drebber reports Hope to the police as a dangerous man, and Hope is arrested. By the time Hope is set free, Drebber and Stangerson, who now works as Drebber’s secretary, have fled to Europe. In time, Hope catches up with them in London.
The narrative then returns to Scotland Yard, where Hope makes a statement, explaining how he killed Drebber and Stangerson for their role in Ferrier’s and Lucy’s deaths. Hope explains that he picked up a drunk Drebber the night Drebber missed his train and took him to the vacant house in Brixton, where Hope revealed his identity. Hope then forced Drebber to pick one of two pills while he swallowed the other. Drebber died of poison. Hope next tried to do the same to Stangerson in Stangerson’s hotel room, but he had to stab Stangerson in self-defense. 
Soon after giving his statement and before he is tried for his crimes, Hope dies of a ruptured aneurysm. Later, Holmes explains to Watson how he made the deductions that led to Hope’s capture. In awe, Watson suggests Holmes publish his account, but the story is already in the paper with credit given to Gregson and Lestrade."
Maritime,"Ten years have passed since the fall of Troy, and the Greek hero Odysseus still has not returned to his kingdom in Ithaca. A large and rowdy mob of suitors who have overrun Odysseus’s palace and pillaged his land continue to court his wife, Penelope. She has remained faithful to Odysseus. Prince Telemachus, Odysseus’s son, wants desperately to throw them out but does not have the confidence or experience to fight them. One of the suitors, Antinous, plans to assassinate the young prince, eliminating the only opposition to their dominion over the palace.
Read more about The Odyssey’s precursor, The Iliad.
Unknown to the suitors, Odysseus is still alive. The beautiful nymph Calypso, possessed by love for him, has imprisoned him on her island, Ogygia. He longs to return to his wife and son, but he has no ship or crew to help him escape. While the gods and goddesses of Mount Olympus debate Odysseus’s future, Athena, Odysseus’s strongest supporter among the gods, resolves to help Telemachus. Disguised as a friend of the prince’s grandfather, Laertes, she convinces the prince to call a meeting of the assembly at which he reproaches the suitors. Athena also prepares him for a great journey to Pylos and Sparta, where the kings Nestor and Menelaus, Odysseus’s companions during the war, inform him that Odysseus is alive and trapped on Calypso’s island. Telemachus makes plans to return home, while, back in Ithaca, Antinous and the other suitors prepare an ambush to kill him when he reaches port.
On Mount Olympus, Zeus sends Hermes to rescue Odysseus from Calypso. Hermes persuades Calypso to let Odysseus build a ship and leave. The homesick hero sets sail, but when Poseidon, god of the sea, finds him sailing home, he sends a storm to wreck Odysseus’s ship. Poseidon has harbored a bitter grudge against Odysseus since the hero blinded his son, the Cyclops Polyphemus, earlier in his travels. Athena intervenes to save Odysseus from Poseidon’s wrath, and the beleaguered king lands at Scheria, home of the Phaeacians. Nausicaa, the Phaeacian princess, shows him to the royal palace, and Odysseus receives a warm welcome from the king and queen. When he identifies himself as Odysseus, his hosts, who have heard of his exploits at Troy, are stunned. They promise to give him safe passage to Ithaca, but first they beg to hear the story of his adventures.
Odysseus spends the night describing the fantastic chain of events leading up to his arrival on Calypso’s island. He recounts his trip to the Land of the Lotus Eaters, his battle with Polyphemus the Cyclops, his love affair with the witch-goddess Circe, his temptation by the deadly Sirens, his journey into Hades to consult the prophet Tiresias, and his fight with the sea monster Scylla. When he finishes his story, the Phaeacians return Odysseus to Ithaca, where he seeks out the hut of his faithful swineherd, Eumaeus. Though Athena has disguised Odysseus as a beggar, Eumaeus warmly receives and nourishes him in the hut. He soon encounters Telemachus, who has returned from Pylos and Sparta despite the suitors’ ambush, and reveals to him his true identity. Odysseus and Telemachus devise a plan to massacre the suitors and regain control of Ithaca.
When Odysseus arrives at the palace the next day, still disguised as a beggar, he endures abuse and insults from the suitors. The only person who recognizes him is his old nurse, Eurycleia, but she swears not to disclose his secret. Penelope takes an interest in this strange beggar, suspecting that he might be her long-lost husband. Quite crafty herself, Penelope organizes an archery contest the following day and promises to marry any man who can string Odysseus’s great bow and fire an arrow through a row of twelve axes—a feat that only Odysseus has ever been able to accomplish. At the contest, each suitor tries to string the bow and fails. Odysseus steps up to the bow and, with little effort, fires an arrow through all twelve axes. He then turns the bow on the suitors. He and Telemachus, assisted by a few faithful servants, kill every last suitor.
Odysseus reveals himself to the entire palace and reunites with his loving Penelope. He travels to the outskirts of Ithaca to see his aging father, Laertes. They come under attack from the vengeful family members of the dead suitors, but Laertes, reinvigorated by his son’s return, successfully kills Antinous’s father and puts a stop to the attack. Zeus dispatches Athena to restore peace. With his power secure and his family reunited, Odysseus’s long ordeal comes to an end."
Heedless,"Lauren Olamina is a fifteen-year-old Black girl living in the Los Angeles area in the year 2024. (Parable of the Sower was published in 1993.) Lauren’s father is a Baptist pastor and also teaches at a nearby college. She has four younger brothers, who are sons of her father and her stepmother, Cory. Their neighborhood is a cul-de-sac, surrounded by walls to create a safe haven in which people look out for one another, despite racial and religious differences. Cory runs the neighborhood school. Outside the walls, desperately poor and starving people struggle to survive, and bands of criminals high on a drug called “pyro,” which makes the user want to set fires, rove about looking for neighborhoods to attack and burn down. Lauren’s father encourages his neighbors to learn how to protect themselves, but he dislikes Lauren’s talk of escaping to go north and wants her to stop sharing that idea with her friends.
Lauren is unusual in two ways. First, because of a drug her biological mother abused, she has hyperempathy: she feels other people’s pleasures and pains as if they were her own. The other unusual thing about Lauren is her outlook on the world. Although she loves and respects her father, she is skeptical of Christianity and other mainstream religions. In a journal she keeps, she develops a new system of thought, which she calls Earthseed. Its central doctrine is that God is Change and cannot be resisted, but God can be influenced. Eventually, Lauren has enough poems and reflections to form what she calls Earthseed: The Book of the Living.
Keith, Lauren’s oldest younger brother and Cory’s favorite child, is also skeptical of organized religion, but in all other ways his approach to life is completely different from Lauren’s. He is selfish and stubborn, eager to prove himself a man, and heedless of his parents’ guidance. A year after the story begins, he runs away from home at age thirteen and, for a while, leads a successful life as a street thug, occasionally showing up at the Olamina house to drop off a bundle of cash—evidence that he has chosen the right path in life. One day, however, his parents must identify his body. His killers tortured him to death but left his face intact so it could be recognized. A few months later, Lauren’s father disappears on the way home from teaching and is never seen again.
The next summer, the neighborhood falls to an attack by pyro addicts. Lauren escapes, along with two others: Harry, a white friend; and Zahra, the Black youngest wife of the neighborhood’s now-dead polygamist. Zahra saw Cory and all of Lauren’s brothers killed by the pyros. Lauren, Harry, and Zahra escape to the coast and then north along U.S. 101, after Lauren cuts her hair and poses as a man to make the three of them look less vulnerable. As they travel, they add others to their group: Travis and Natividad Douglas and their infant son, Dominic; a doctor, Taylor Bankole, who is about the same age as Lauren’s father; two sisters, Allie and Jill Gilchrist; an orphaned toddler, Justin Rohr; Emery Solis and her daughter Tori; and Grayson Mora and daughter Doe, all escaped slaves.
During the trek northward, which includes a detour through Sacramento to avoid chaos in the Bay Area, Lauren tells her companions about Earthseed. Someday, she says, it will spread to other planets, but for now her goal is to start a community on earth. The others’ levels of interest vary, but none are hostile to Lauren’s ideas. By now, Lauren is eighteen. She and Bankole become a couple, despite their age difference. He owns property on the northern coast, where his sister and her family currently live. The acreage is enough for the entire group to settle on and start the first Earthseed community. He is not an Earthseed believer, but he is happy to support Lauren in her mission.
Jill dies protecting Tori during an attack by pyro addicts, but the rest of the group, after surviving dangers that include not just criminal attacks but also an earthquake and a firestorm, eventually reaches Bankole’s land, high up in the hills of redwood country. The home Bankole’s sister and her husband built has been burned to the ground, and five skulls inside testify to the family’s fate. Stunned, the group debates what to do to next. In the end, they agree that even though the remoteness of the location has proven to be no guarantee of safety, Bankole’s land is still the best place for them to build the Earthseed community. After holding a memorial service for all the loved ones they have lost, Lauren and her companions name their new home Acorn."
Millions,"A Million Little Pieces opens with the narrator, James, waking up on an airplane with no idea where he is going. He has a hole in his cheek, four broken teeth, and a broken nose. James eventually finds out that the plane is bound for Chicago and that a doctor and two unidentified men brought him on board. James lands to find his parents, who have come all the way from Tokyo to pick him up, waiting for him. James’s condition shocks and saddens them, and they immediately drive him to the family cabin. They next day, they check him into a rehabilitation facility in Minnesota. Almost immediately after arrival, another patient pulls James to the floor when James refuses to give up his seat in the lounge. Things improve somewhat when James meets a young woman named Lilly at the dispensary and a friendly, middle-aged career criminal named Leonard at a meal. Both become his friends.
Near-constant vomiting and pain mark James’s early days at the clinic. To fix his broken teeth, James submits himself to a horrific double root canal without Novocain. James decides that his condition is hopeless and walks out of the clinic, but Leonard follows him and convinces him to stay. James’s brother Bob and two friends show up at the clinic unexpectedly for visiting day and bring some gifts. This show of kindness moves James deeply. After Bob leaves, James’s parents call him and ask if he’ll do the Family Program, during which they would come to the clinic and engage in counseling sessions with him. He says he doesn’t want them to come. James begins reading the Tao Te Ching, and it greatly inspires him. For once, James has found something that makes sense to him, something that speaks of self-reliance. Though he knows that the clinic staff is trying to help him, he cannot accept the Twelve Step method of recovery, and he refuses to complete any of the tasks they set before him.
One evening, Leonard sits down with James and tells him a heart-wrenching story about his upbringing and how he landed in the clinic. Near the end of the story, Leonard breaks down and cries in front of James, and tells him to “hold on.” From this point onward, James has a deep respect for Leonard, and the notion of holding on resonates deeply with him. In the cafeteria, Lilly slides James a scrap of paper, which tells him to meet her in the clearing outside of the clinic. This is the start of the love affair between James and Lilly, a relationship they pursue though the clinic’s rules state that men and women patients cannot interact with each other. James and Lilly often meet for long periods of time, kissing, holding each other, and talking. The relationships with Lilly and Leonard are two of the truest that James has ever known.
James’s parents arrive at the clinic for the Family Program, despite his objections. Though seeing them is upsetting, James decides to participate. During a critical session, James finds out that he had an ear infection throughout his early childhood that made him scream and cry, which his parents left untreated. Also, he finds out that his grandfather had a drinking problem. James’s parents feel that maybe his grandfather’s addiction and the untreated ear infection had something to do with James’s addictions, but he refuses to accept this theory. As is his way in most areas of his life, James wants to go it alone and do things deeply and completely—this includes taking all responsibility for his condition. His addiction, he believes, is no illness. It is a weakness. It can only be overcome by taking full ownership. Once he comes to this conclusion, things begin to change for James.
James’s parents have to leave unexpectedly because James’s father has a pressing business engagement. Although their early departure upsets James, their good-byes are on good terms. Soon after, James finds out from a distraught Lilly that her grandmother is gravely ill and only has a short time to live. Lilly runs away from the clinic, and James literally runs off after her. Two clinic staff members, Hank and Lincoln, follow him in a van and offer assistance. She is eventually found in an abandoned building in the middle of a sexual act, and it is clear that she has been smoking crack. Though James sees crack and has a chance to use it, he chooses Lilly over the drugs. He brings her safely back to the clinic and is permitted to stay. Lilly is forced to start over again with detoxification and will have to pay for another term, something she cannot afford.
Continuing his quest to accept responsibility for his own life, James faces the criminal charges against him in Ohio. At first, he believes that he’ll have to be in jail for three years, but the sentence is mysteriously reduced to three months. James believes that his friend Leonard and his roommate Miles Davis helped reduce his sentence, but this fact is never confirmed. Leonard completes his program and prepares to leave the clinic. Before he does, he arranges for Lilly’s program to be paid for and asks James to be his son. The day before James leaves to begin his jail sentence, he confesses that a priest in Paris made unwanted sexual advances toward him, and that he beat the man seriously, possibly even killing him. This admission triggers a release in James, and he knows he is ready to leave. James’s brother and a friend pick him up at the clinic, and he immediately asks them to go to a bar. His brother and friend are stunned but give in to James’s request. At the bar James has Bob give him forty dollars and orders an entire pint glass full of whiskey. After looking at the glass and smelling the whiskey, James asks the bartender to pour it down the drain."
Noblest,"Winston Smith is a low-ranking member of the ruling Party in London, in the nation of Oceania. Everywhere Winston goes, even his own home, the Party watches him through telescreens; everywhere he looks he sees the face of the Party’s seemingly omniscient leader, a figure known only as Big Brother. The Party controls everything in Oceania, even the people’s history and language. Currently, the Party is forcing the implementation of an invented language called Newspeak, which attempts to prevent political rebellion by eliminating all words related to it. Even thinking rebellious thoughts is illegal. Such thoughtcrime is, in fact, the worst of all crimes.
As the novel opens, Winston feels frustrated by the oppression and rigid control of the Party, which prohibits free thought, sex, and any expression of individuality. Winston dislikes the party and has illegally purchased a diary in which to write his criminal thoughts. He has also become fixated on a powerful Party member named O’Brien, whom Winston believes is a secret member of the Brotherhood—the mysterious, legendary group that works to overthrow the Party.
Winston works in the Ministry of Truth, where he alters historical records to fit the needs of the Party. He notices a coworker, a beautiful dark-haired girl, staring at him, and worries that she is an informant who will turn him in for his thoughtcrime. He is troubled by the Party’s control of history: the Party claims that Oceania has always been allied with Eastasia in a war against Eurasia, but Winston seems to recall a time when this was not true. The Party also claims that Emmanuel Goldstein, the alleged leader of the Brotherhood, is the most dangerous man alive, but this does not seem plausible to Winston. Winston spends his evenings wandering through the poorest neighborhoods in London, where the proletarians, or proles, live squalid lives, relatively free of Party monitoring.
One day, Winston receives a note from the dark-haired girl that reads “I love you.” She tells him her name, Julia, and they begin a covert affair, always on the lookout for signs of Party monitoring. Eventually they rent a room above the secondhand store in the prole district where Winston bought the diary. This relationship lasts for some time. Winston is sure that they will be caught and punished sooner or later (the fatalistic Winston knows that he has been doomed since he wrote his first diary entry), while Julia is more pragmatic and optimistic. As Winston’s affair with Julia progresses, his hatred for the Party grows more and more intense. At last, he receives the message that he has been waiting for: O’Brien wants to see him.
Winston and Julia travel to O’Brien’s luxurious apartment. As a member of the powerful Inner Party (Winston belongs to the Outer Party), O’Brien leads a life of luxury that Winston can only imagine. O’Brien confirms to Winston and Julia that, like them, he hates the Party, and says that he works against it as a member of the Brotherhood. He indoctrinates Winston and Julia into the Brotherhood, and gives Winston a copy of Emmanuel Goldstein’s book, the manifesto of the Brotherhood. Winston reads the book—an amalgam of several forms of class-based twentieth-century social theory—to Julia in the room above the store. Suddenly, soldiers barge in and seize them. Mr. Charrington, the proprietor of the store, is revealed as having been a member of the Thought Police all along.
Torn away from Julia and taken to a place called the Ministry of Love, Winston finds that O’Brien, too, is a Party spy who simply pretended to be a member of the Brotherhood in order to trap Winston into committing an open act of rebellion against the Party. O’Brien spends months torturing and brainwashing Winston, who struggles to resist. At last, O’Brien sends him to the dreaded Room 101, the final destination for anyone who opposes the Party. Here, O’Brien tells Winston that he will be forced to confront his worst fear. Throughout the novel, Winston has had recurring nightmares about rats; O’Brien now straps a cage full of rats onto Winston’s head and prepares to allow the rats to eat his face. Winston snaps, pleading with O’Brien to do it to Julia, not to him.
Giving up Julia is what O’Brien wanted from Winston all along. His spirit broken, Winston is released to the outside world. He meets Julia but no longer feels anything for her. He has accepted the Party entirely and has learned to love Big Brother."
Invigorate,"Grendel, a large bearlike monster, has spent the last twelve years locked in a war against a band of humans. The main action of Grendel takes place in the last year of that war, but the novel skips back in time in order to illuminate the origins of the conflict as well as Grendel’s personal history.
As a young monster, Grendel lives with his mother in a cave on the outskirts of human civilization. A foul, wretched creature who long ago abandoned language, Grendel’s mother is his only kin or companion. One day, the young Grendel discovers a lake full of firesnakes and, swimming through it, reaches the human world on the other side. On one of his early explorations he finds himself caught in a tree. A bull and then a band of humans attack Grendel before his mother rescues him.
Grendel becomes fascinated with the world of men, watching from a safe distance as mankind evolves from a nomadic, tribal culture into a feudal system with roads, governments, and militaries. He is alternately befuddled by their actions and disgusted by their wasteful, brute violence. Grendel watches as Hrothgar of the Danes (also known as the Scyldings, after an illustrious ancestor) develops into the most powerful king in the area.
Eventually, Hrothgar’s power and fortune attract the services of the Shaper, a court bard who sings glorious tales of Danish kings and heroes. Though the Shaper’s songs are only partially based on fact, their imaginative visions of a supremely ordered moral world are incredibly powerful and invigorating. Inspired by the Shaper’s words, Hrothgar builds a magnificent meadhall and names it Hart. Even Grendel, who has witnessed the true, savage history of the Danes, finds the Shaper’s vision extremely seductive and becomes ashamed at his own brute, bestial nature.
Grendel, increasingly upset by his split feelings about the Shaper, visits a dragon in search of some advice. The dragon belittles the Shaper and declares all moral and philosophical systems pointless and irrelevant. Grendel gradually adopts this worldview and becomes enraged at the humans. He begins to raid Hart systematically, initiating the twelve-year war. In his first battle, Grendel handily defeats Unferth, one of Hrothgar’s mightiest thanes (or soldiers), and adds insult to injury by scoffing at Unferth’s romantic ideas of heroism.
Other kings increasingly threaten Hrothgar, who preemptively tries to attack one of them: Hygmod, king of the Helmings. In order to avoid a war, Hygmod offers Hrothgar the hand of his sister, Wealtheow, in marriage. Hrothgar accepts, and Wealtheow becomes the much beloved queen of the Scyldings, bringing a new sense of peace and harmony to the vulgar, masculine world of Hart. The lovely queen briefly enraptures Grendel, and only a nighttime attack and a cold, misogynistic look at her genitals rids him of her spell.
Some years later, Hrothgar’s brother Halga is killed, and Halga’s orphaned son, Hrothulf, comes to live at Hart. Hrothgar and Wealtheow already have two sons of their own, and the presence of so many possible heirs to the Scylding throne makes Wealtheow nervous. Hrothulf, for his part, is disgusted by the split he sees between the laboring class and the aristocracy, and he plans a revolutionary overthrow of the government. Hrothulf’s counselor, a peasant named Red Horse, tries to convince Hrothulf that all governments are inherently evil and that a revolution merely replaces one corrupt system with another.
In the winter of the final year of the war, Grendel watches a Scylding religious ceremony. When all the other priests have left, Grendel meets an old, blind priest and pretends to be the supreme Scylding deity, known as the Destroyer. Grendel asks the old priest, Ork, to say what he knows about the Destroyer, and Ork offers him a complex metaphysical system he has spent years working out. Ork is almost moved to a state of ecstasy by the experience, and a puzzled Grendel withdraws as three younger priests come to chastise Ork for his strange behavior. A fourth priest meets them and is overjoyed at the news of Ork’s vision.
Later the same winter, the Shaper dies. Grendel experiences an increasing feeling of dread, though he cannot place it or puzzle it out. His mother senses it also, and though she tries warning Grendel, she can only produce the gibberish phrase “Warrovish,” which Grendel later deciphers to mean “Beware the fish.” Fifteen strangers arrive from over the sea: they are Geats, and their leader is Beowulf, who has come to rid the Scyldings of Grendel. Grendel knows that the Geats are what he has been waiting for, and he is alternately frightened and excited. The Scyldings are none too pleased at Beowulf’s arrival, and that night at dinner, Unferth taunts Beowulf for famously having lost a swimming contest. Beowulf coldly responds that Unferth has been misled, and calmly declares that Unferth is doomed to hell because he killed his own brothers.
When the Geats and the Scyldings fall asleep, Grendel attacks Hart. Beowulf manages to surprise Grendel and grabs his arm. As they struggle, Grendel slips on a pool of blood, and Beowulf gains the upper hand. Beowulf begins whispering madly in Grendel’s ear. Grendel moves in and out of a series of hallucinations in which he sees Beowulf sprouting an enormous pair of wings. Beowulf smashes Grendel against a wall, cracking his head open and demanding that he “sing of walls.” Beowulf manages to rip Grendel’s arm off at the shoulder, and Grendel runs off into the night. He finds himself at the edge of a cliff, staring down into its dark, murky depths. A host of animals gather around Grendel, seeming to condemn him, and the novel closes as Grendel whispers to them, “Poor Grendel’s had an accident. . . . So may you all.”"
Memorable,"Scout Finch lives with her brother, Jem, and their widowed father, Atticus, in the sleepy Alabama town of Maycomb. Maycomb is suffering through the Great Depression, but Atticus is a prominent lawyer and the Finch family is reasonably well off in comparison to the rest of society. One summer, Jem and Scout befriend a boy named Dill, who has come to live in their neighborhood for the summer, and the trio acts out stories together. Eventually, Dill becomes fascinated with the spooky house on their street called the Radley Place. The house is owned by Mr. Nathan Radley, whose brother, Arthur (nicknamed Boo), has lived there for years without venturing outside.
Scout goes to school for the first time that fall and detests it. She and Jem find gifts apparently left for them in a knothole of a tree on the Radley property. Dill returns the following summer, and he, Scout, and Jem begin to act out the story of Boo Radley. Atticus puts a stop to their antics, urging the children to try to see life from another person’s perspective before making judgments. But, on Dill’s last night in Maycomb for the summer, the three sneak onto the Radley property, where Nathan Radley shoots at them. Jem loses his pants in the ensuing escape. When he returns for them, he finds them mended and hung over the fence.
The next winter, Jem and Scout find more presents in the tree, presumably left by the mysterious Boo. Nathan Radley eventually plugs the knothole with cement. Shortly thereafter, a fire breaks out in another neighbor’s house, and during the fire someone slips a blanket on Scout’s shoulders as she watches the blaze. Convinced that Boo did it, Jem tells Atticus about the mended pants and the presents.
To the consternation of Maycomb’s racist white community, Atticus agrees to defend a Black man named Tom Robinson, who has been accused of raping a white woman. Because of Atticus’s decision, Jem and Scout are subjected to abuse from other children, even when they celebrate Christmas at the family compound on Finch’s Landing. Calpurnia, the Finches’ Black cook, takes them to the local Black church, where the warm and close-knit community largely embraces the children.
Atticus’s sister, Alexandra, comes to live with the Finches the next summer. Dill, who is supposed to live with his “new father” in another town, runs away and comes to Maycomb. Tom Robinson’s trial begins, and when the accused man is placed in the local jail, a mob gathers to lynch him. Atticus faces the mob down the night before the trial. Jem and Scout, who have sneaked out of the house, soon join him. Scout recognizes one of the men, and her polite questioning about his son shames him into dispersing the mob.
At the trial itself, the children sit in the “colored balcony” with the town’s Black citizens. Atticus provides clear evidence that the accusers, Mayella Ewell and her father, Bob, are lying: in fact, Mayella propositioned Tom Robinson, was caught by her father, and then accused Tom of rape to cover her shame and guilt. Atticus provides impressive evidence that the marks on Mayella’s face are from wounds that her father inflicted; upon discovering her with Tom, he called her a whore and beat her. Yet, despite the significant evidence pointing to Tom’s innocence, the all-white jury convicts him. The innocent Tom later tries to escape from prison and is shot to death. In the aftermath of the trial, Jem’s faith in justice is badly shaken, and he lapses into despondency and doubt.
Despite the verdict, Bob Ewell feels that Atticus and the judge have made a fool out of him, and he vows revenge. He menaces Tom Robinson’s widow, tries to break into the judge’s house, and finally attacks Jem and Scout as they walk home from a Halloween party. Boo Radley intervenes, however, saving the children and stabbing Ewell fatally during the struggle. Boo carries the wounded Jem back to Atticus’s house, where the sheriff, in order to protect Boo, insists that Ewell tripped over a tree root and fell on his own knife. After sitting with Scout for a while, Boo disappears once more into the Radley house.  
Later, Scout feels as though she can finally imagine what life is like for Boo. He has become a human being to her at last. With this realization, Scout embraces her father’s advice to practice sympathy and understanding and demonstrates that her experiences with hatred and prejudice will not sully her faith in human goodness."
Raised,"A Raisin in the Sun portrays a few weeks in the life of the Youngers, a Black family living on the South Side of Chicago in the 1950s. When the play opens, the Youngers are about to receive an insurance check for $10,000. This money comes from the deceased Mr. Younger’s life insurance policy. Each of the adult members of the family has an idea as to what he or she would like to do with this money. The matriarch of the family, Mama, wants to buy a house to fulfill a dream she shared with her husband. Mama’s son, Walter Lee, would rather use the money to invest in a liquor store with his friends. He believes that the investment will solve the family’s financial problems forever. Walter’s wife, Ruth, agrees with Mama, however, and hopes that she and Walter can provide more space and opportunity for their son, Travis. Finally, Beneatha, Walter’s sister and Mama’s daughter, wants to use the money for her medical school tuition. She also wishes that her family members were not so interested in assimilating into the white world. Beneatha instead tries to find her identity by looking back to the past and to Africa.
As the play progresses, the Youngers clash over their competing dreams. Ruth discovers that she is pregnant but fears that if she has the child, she will put more financial pressure on her family members. When Walter says nothing to Ruth’s admission that she is considering abortion, Mama puts a down payment on a house for the whole family. She believes that a bigger, brighter dwelling will help them all. This house is in Clybourne Park, an entirely white neighborhood. When the Youngers’ future neighbors find out that the Youngers are moving in, they send Mr. Lindner, from the Clybourne Park Improvement Association, to offer the Youngers money in return for staying away. The Youngers refuse the deal, even after Walter loses the rest of the money ($6,500) to his friend Willy Harris, who persuades Walter to invest in the liquor store and then runs off with his cash.
In the meantime, Beneatha rejects her suitor, George Murchison, whom she believes to be shallow and blind to the problems of race. Subsequently, she receives a marriage proposal from her Nigerian boyfriend, Joseph Asagai, who wants Beneatha to get a medical degree and move to Africa with him (Beneatha does not make her choice before the end of the play). The Youngers eventually move out of the apartment, fulfilling the family’s long-held dream. Their future seems uncertain and slightly dangerous, but they are optimistic and determined to live a better life. They believe that they can succeed if they stick together as a family and resolve to defer their dreams no longer."
Kindles,"The Awakening opens in the late 1800s in Grand Isle, a summer holiday resort popular with the wealthy inhabitants of nearby New Orleans. Edna Pontellier is vacationing with her husband, Léonce, and their two sons at the cottages of Madame Lebrun, which house affluent Creoles from the French Quarter. Léonce is kind and loving but preoccupied with his work. His frequent business-related absences mar his domestic life with Edna. Consequently, Edna spends most of her time with her friend Adèle Ratignolle, a married Creole who epitomizes womanly elegance and charm. Through her relationship with Adèle, Edna learns a great deal about freedom of expression. Because Creole women were expected and assumed to be chaste, they could behave in a forthright and unreserved manner. Exposure to such openness liberates Edna from her previously prudish behavior and repressed emotions and desires.
Edna’s relationship with Adèle begins Edna’s process of “awakening” and self-discovery, which constitutes the focus of the book. The process accelerates as Edna comes to know Robert Lebrun, the elder, single son of Madame Lebrun. Robert is known among the Grand Isle vacationers as a man who chooses one woman each year—often a married woman—to whom he then plays “attendant” all summer long. This summer, he devotes himself to Edna, and the two spend their days together lounging and talking by the shore. Adèle Ratignolle often accompanies them.
At first, the relationship between Robert and Edna is innocent. They mostly bathe in the sea or engage in idle talk. As the summer progresses, however, Edna and Robert grow closer, and Robert’s affections and attention inspire in Edna several internal revelations. She feels more alive than ever before, and she starts to paint again as she did in her youth. She also learns to swim and becomes aware of her independence and sexuality. Edna and Robert never openly discuss their love for one another, but the time they spend alone together kindles memories in Edna of the dreams and desires of her youth. She becomes inexplicably depressed at night with her husband and profoundly joyful during her moments of freedom, whether alone or with Robert. Recognizing how intense the relationship between him and Edna has become, Robert honorably removes himself from Grand Isle to avoid consummating his forbidden love. Edna returns to New Orleans a changed woman.
Back in New Orleans, Edna actively pursues her painting and ignores all of her social responsibilities. Worried about the changing attitude and increasing disobedience of his wife, Léonce seeks the guidance of the family physician, Doctor Mandelet. A wise and enlightened man, Doctor Mandelet suspects that Edna’s transformation is the result of an affair, but he hides his suspicions from Léonce. Instead, Doctor Mandelet suggests that Léonce let Edna’s defiance run its course, since attempts to control her would only fuel her rebellion. Léonce heeds the doctor’s advice, allowing Edna to remain home alone while he is away on business. With her husband gone and her children away as well, Edna wholly rejects her former lifestyle. She moves into a home of her own and declares herself independent—the possession of no one. Her love for Robert still intense, Edna pursues an affair with the town seducer, Alcée Arobin, who is able to satisfy her sexual needs. Never emotionally attached to Arobin, Edna maintains control throughout their affair, satisfying her animalistic urges but retaining her freedom from male domination.
At this point, the self-sufficient and unconventional old pianist Mademoiselle Reisz adopts Edna as a sort of protégé, warning Edna of the sacrifices required of an artist. Edna is moved by Mademoiselle Reisz’s piano playing and visits her often. She is also eager to read the letters from abroad that Robert sends the woman. A woman who devotes her life entirely to her art, Mademoiselle serves as an inspiration and model to Edna, who continues her process of awakening and independence. Mademoiselle Reisz is the only person who knows of Robert and Edna’s secret love for one another and she encourages Edna to admit to, and act upon, her feelings.
Unable to stay away, Robert returns to New Orleans, finally expressing openly his feelings for Edna. He admits his love but reminds her that they cannot possibly be together, since she is the wife of another man. Edna explains to him her newly established independence, denying the rights of her husband over her and explaining how she and Robert can live together happily, ignoring everything extraneous to their relationship. But despite his love for Edna, Robert feels unable to enter into the adulterous affair.
When Adèle undergoes a difficult and dangerous childbirth, Edna leaves Robert’s arms to go to her friend. She pleads with him to wait for her return. From the time she spends with Edna, Adèle senses that Edna is becoming increasingly distant, and she understands that Edna’s relationship with Robert has intensified. She reminds Edna to think of her children and advocates the socially acceptable lifestyle Edna abandoned so long ago. Doctor Mandelet, while walking Edna home from Adèle’s, urges her to come see him because he is worried about the outcome of her passionate but confused actions. Already reeling under the weight of Adèle’s admonition, Edna begins to perceive herself as having acted selfishly.
Edna returns to her house to find Robert gone, a note of farewell left in his place. Robert’s inability to escape the ties of society now prompts Edna’s most devastating awakening. Haunted by thoughts of her children and realizing that she would have eventually found even Robert unable to fulfill her desires and dreams, Edna feels an overwhelming sense of solitude. Alone in a world in which she has found no feeling of belonging, she can find only one answer to the inescapable and heartbreaking limitations of society. She returns to Grand Isle, the site of her first moments of emotional, sexual, and intellectual awareness, and, in a final escape, gives herself to the sea. As she swims through the soft, embracing water, she thinks about her freedom from her husband and children, as well as Robert’s failure to understand her, Doctor Mandelet’s words of wisdom, and Mademoiselle Reisz’s courage. The text leaves open the question of whether the suicide constitutes a cowardly surrender or a liberating triumph."
Native,"Bigger Thomas, a poor, uneducated, twenty-year-old Black man in 1930s Chicago, wakes up one morning in his family’s cramped apartment on the South Side of the city. He sees a huge rat scamper across the room, which he corners and kills with a skillet. Having grown up under the climate of harsh racial prejudice in 1930s America, Bigger is burdened with a powerful conviction that he has no control over his life and that he cannot aspire to anything other than menial, low-wage labor. His mother pesters him to take a job with a rich white man named Mr. Dalton, but Bigger instead chooses to meet up with his friends to plan the robbery of a white man’s store.
Anger, fear, and frustration define Bigger’s daily existence, as he is forced to hide behind a façade of toughness or risk succumbing to despair. While Bigger and his gang have robbed many Black-owned businesses, they have never attempted to rob a white man. Bigger sees whites not as individuals, but as a natural, oppressive force—a great looming “whiteness” pressing down upon him. Bigger’s fear of confronting this force overwhelms him, but rather than admit his fear, he violently attacks a member of his gang to sabotage the robbery. Left with no other options, Bigger takes a job as a chauffeur for the Daltons.
Coincidentally, Mr. Dalton is also Bigger’s landlord, as he owns a controlling share of the company that manages the apartment building where Bigger’s family lives. Mr. Dalton and other wealthy real estate barons are effectively robbing the poor, Black tenants on Chicago’s South Side—they refuse to allow Black people to rent apartments in predominantly white neighborhoods, thus leading to overpopulation and artificially high rents in the predominantly Black South Side. Mr. Dalton sees himself as a benevolent philanthropist, however, as he donates money to Black schools and offers jobs to “poor, timid black boys” like Bigger. However, Mr. Dalton practices this token philanthropy mainly to alleviate his guilty conscience for exploiting poor Black people.
Mary, Mr. Dalton’s daughter, frightens and angers Bigger by ignoring the social taboos that govern the relations between white women and Black men. On his first day of work, Bigger drives Mary to meet her communist boyfriend, Jan. Eager to prove their progressive ideals and racial tolerance, Mary and Jan force Bigger to take them to a restaurant in the South Side. Despite Bigger’s embarrassment, they order drinks, and as the evening passes, all three of them get drunk. Bigger then drives around the city while Mary and Jan make out in the back seat. Afterward, Mary is too drunk to make it to her bedroom on her own, so Bigger helps her up the stairs. Drunk and aroused by his unprecedented proximity to a young white woman, Bigger begins to kiss Mary.
Just as Bigger places Mary on her bed, Mary’s blind mother, Mrs. Dalton, enters the bedroom. Though Mrs. Dalton cannot see him, her ghostlike presence terrifies him. Bigger worries that Mary, in her drunken condition, will reveal his presence. He covers her face with a pillow and accidentally smothers her to death. Unaware that Mary has been killed, Mrs. Dalton prays over her daughter and returns to bed. Bigger tries to conceal his crime by burning Mary’s body in the Daltons’ furnace. He decides to try to use the Daltons’ prejudice against communists to frame Jan for Mary’s disappearance. Bigger believes that the Daltons will assume Jan is dangerous and that he may have kidnapped their daughter for political purposes. Additionally, Bigger takes advantage of the Daltons’ racial prejudices to avoid suspicion, continuing to play the role of a timid, ignorant Black servant who would be unable to commit such an act.
Mary’s murder gives Bigger a sense of power and identity he has never known. Bigger’s girlfriend, Bessie, makes an offhand comment that inspires him to try to collect ransom money from the Daltons. They know only that Mary has vanished, not that she is dead. Bigger writes a ransom letter, playing upon the Daltons’ hatred of communists by signing his name “Red.” He then bullies Bessie to take part in the ransom scheme. However, Mary’s bones are found in the furnace, and Bigger flees with Bessie to an empty building. Bigger rapes Bessie and, frightened that she will give him away, bludgeons her to death with a brick after she falls asleep.
Bigger eludes the massive manhunt for as long as he can, but he is eventually captured after a dramatic shoot-out. The press and the public determine his guilt and his punishment before his trial even begins. The furious populace assumes that he raped Mary before killing her and burned her body to hide the evidence of the rape. Moreover, the white authorities and the white mob use Bigger’s crime as an excuse to terrorize the entire South Side .
Jan visits Bigger in jail. He says that he understands how he terrified, angered, and shamed Bigger through his violation of the social taboos that govern tense race relations. Jan enlists his friend, Boris A. Max, to defend Bigger free of charge. Jan and Max speak with Bigger as a human being, and Bigger begins to see whites as individuals and himself as their equal.
Max tries to save Bigger from the death penalty, arguing that while his client is responsible for his crime, it is vital to recognize that he is a product of his environment. Part of the blame for Bigger’s crimes belongs to the fearful, hopeless existence that he has experienced in a racist society since birth. Max warns that there will be more men like Bigger if America does not put an end to the vicious cycle of hatred and vengeance. Despite Max’s arguments, Bigger is sentenced to death.
Bigger is not a traditional hero by any means. However, Wright forces us to enter into Bigger’s mind and to understand the devastating effects of the social conditions in which he was raised. Bigger was not born a violent criminal. He is a “native son”: a product of American culture and the violence and racism that suffuse it."
Certainty,"Meursault, the narrator, is a young man living in Algiers. After receiving a telegram informing him of his mother’s death, he takes a bus to Marengo, where his mother had been living in an old persons’ home. He sleeps for almost the entire trip. When he arrives, he speaks to the director of the home. The director allows Meursault to see his mother, but Meursault finds that her body has already been sealed in the coffin. He declines the caretaker’s offer to open the coffin.
That night, Meursault keeps vigil over his mother’s body. Much to his displeasure, the talkative caretaker stays with him the whole time. Meursault smokes a cigarette, drinks coffee, and dozes off. The next morning, before the funeral, he meets with the director again. The director informs him that Thomas Perez, an old man who had grown very close to Meursault’s mother, will be attending the funeral service. The funeral procession heads for the small local village, but Perez has difficulty keeping up and eventually faints from the heat. Meursault reports that he remembers little of the funeral. That night, he happily arrives back in Algiers.
The next day, Meursault goes to the public beach for a swim. There, he runs into Marie Cardona, his former co-worker. The two make a date to see a comedy at the movie theater that evening. After the movie they spend the night together. When Meursault wakes up, Marie is gone. He stays in bed until noon and then sits on his balcony until evening, watching the people pass on the street.
The following day, Monday, Meursault returns to work. He has lunch with his friend Emmanuel and then works all afternoon. While walking upstairs to his apartment that night, Meursault runs into Salamano, an old man who lives in his building and owns a mangy dog. Meursault also runs into his neighbor, Raymond Sintes, who is widely rumored to be a pimp. Raymond invites Meursault over for dinner. Over the meal, Raymond recounts how he beat up his mistress after he discovered that she had been cheating on him. As a result, he got into a fight with her brother. Raymond now wants to torment his mistress even more, but he needs Meursault to write a letter to lure his mistress back to him. Meursault agrees and writes the letter that night.
The following Saturday, Marie visits Meursault at his apartment. She asks Meursault if he loves her, and he replies that “it didn’t mean anything,” but probably not. The two then hear shouting coming from Raymond’s apartment. They go out into the hall and watch as a policeman arrives. The policeman slaps Raymond and says that he will be summoned to the police station for beating up his mistress. Later, Raymond asks Meursault to testify on his behalf, and Meursault agrees. That night, Raymond runs into Salamano, who laments that his dog has run away.
Marie asks Meursault if he wants to marry her. He replies indifferently but says that they can get married if she wants to, so they become engaged. The following Sunday, Meursault, Marie, and Raymond go to a beach house owned by Masson, one of Raymond’s friends. They swim happily in the ocean and then have lunch. That afternoon, Masson, Raymond, and Meursault run into two Arabs on the beach, one of whom is the brother of Raymond’s mistress. A fight breaks out and Raymond is stabbed. After tending to his wounds, Raymond returns to the beach with Meursault. They find the Arabs at a spring. Raymond considers shooting them with his gun, but Meursault talks him out of it and takes the gun away. Later, however, Meursault returns to the spring to cool off, and, for no apparent reason, he shoots Raymond’s mistress’s brother.
Meursault is arrested and thrown into jail. His lawyer seems disgusted at Meursault’s lack of remorse over his crime, and, in particular, at Meursault’s lack of grief at his mother’s funeral. Later, Meursault meets with the examining magistrate, who cannot understand Meursault’s actions. The magistrate brandishes a crucifix and demands that Meursault put his faith in God. Meursault refuses, insisting that he does not believe in God. The magistrate cannot accept Meursault’s lack of belief, and eventually dubs him “Monsieur Antichrist.”
One day, Marie visits Meursault in prison. She forces herself to smile during the visit, and she expresses hope that Meursault will be acquitted and that they will get married. As he awaits his trial, Meursault slowly adapts to prison life. His isolation from nature, women, and cigarettes torments him at first, but he eventually adjusts to living without them, and soon does not even notice their absence. He manages to keep his mind occupied, and he sleeps for most of each day.
Meursault is taken to the courthouse early on the morning of his trial. Spectators and members of the press fill the courtroom. The subject of the trial quickly shifts away from the murder to a general discussion of Meursault’s character, and of his reaction to his mother’s death in particular. The director and several other people who attended the vigil and the funeral are called to testify, and they all attest to Meursault’s lack of grief or tears. Marie reluctantly testifies that the day after his mother’s funeral she and Meursault went on a date and saw a comedic movie. During his summation the following day, the prosecutor calls Meursault a monster and says that his lack of moral feeling threatens all of society. Meursault is found guilty and is sentenced to death by beheading.
Meursault returns to prison to await his execution. He struggles to come to terms with his situation, and he has trouble accepting the certainty and inevitability of his fate. He imagines escaping and he dreams of filing a successful legal appeal. One day, the chaplain comes to visit against Meursault’s wishes. He urges Meursault to renounce his atheism and turn to God, but Meursault refuses. Like the magistrate, the chaplain cannot believe that Meursault does not long for faith and the afterlife. Meursault suddenly becomes enraged, grabs the chaplain, and begins shouting at him. He declares that he is correct in believing in a meaningless, purely physical world. For the first time, Meursault truly embraces the idea that human existence holds no greater meaning. He abandons all hope for the future and accepts the “gentle indifference of the world.” This acceptance makes Meursault feel happy."
Soldier,"The Good Soldier opens with John Dowell, the narrator, informing the reader that ""this is the saddest story [he] ever heard."" His story, he explains will be about the nine-year acquaintance that he and his wife Florence had with another couple, Edward and Leonora Ashburnham. Because this novel is comprised of Dowell's thoughts as he writes them, the plot is not chronological; it shifts back and forth between past events and Dowell's current reflections on those events. Overall, the novel is divided into four parts.
In Part 1 of The Good Soldier, Dowell explains the background of the four protagonists. He and Florence are Americans, from Philadelphia and Stamford, Connecticut, respectively. Edward and Leonora are British, the former a Catholic from Ireland, and the latter an Anglican from a respected family in Fordingbridge. Dowell sees similarities between the two couples. Both Dowell's wife, Florence, and Edward Ashburnham are ""heart patients."" The couples meet in Nauheim, a health spa, in August 1904 where both ""invalids"" come to improve their health.
The four strike up a friendship. Dowell describes Edward as perfectly honest and upright, someone with whom you could trust your wife. Dowell goes on to narrate in detail an excursion that the two couples took to a town which houses Martin Luther's protest. In the bedroom, while Florence is discussing the Protest, Leonora realizes Florence and Edward will have an affair. Dowell is blind to this implication. In this part of the novel, Dowell compares their friendship to a minuet, and to ""an extraordinarily safe castle,"" but then he bemoans the end of permanence and stability now that their friendship, nine years later, is over.
Edward has been having numerous affairs: with a woman in the back of a railway car, with the mistress of a Grand Duke in Monte Carlo, with a woman married to an army officer in India, and with a young, submissive woman the Ashburnhams have brought with them from India to Nauheim. After the affair with La Dolciquita, Edward brought the Ashburnhams into deep debt, and Leonora took complete control of all his money and land. The Ashburnhams have been in India eight years to save money, and now that they are in Nauheim, Leonora feels she has regained control of their lives. On the day that they meet the Dowells, Leonora sees Maisie Maidan coming out of her husband's bedroom and she assumes they are having an affair. She boxes Mrs. Maidan's ears, and Florence sees this act of violence. Leonora, who cares deeply about propriety, attempts to befriend Florence to cover up what has been witnessed; that is how the two couples become friends.
Part 1 ends with Mrs. Maidan's death. Now that Florence has started an affair with Edward, Mrs. Maidan overhears them talking about her, and finds out that Leonora has brought her along so that she may be a ""safe"" mistress for Edward. Mrs. Maidan is appalled and dies. Unlike Florence and Edward, she suffers from a real heart condition. Leonora lives with the guilt over this death.
In Part 2, Dowell explains Florence's real desire to be the lady of Fordingbridge, in the town in England where her ancestors were forced to live centuries ago. Edward Ashburnham's estate, Branshaw Manor, is in Fordingbridge. The chapter flashes back to Dowell and Florence's first meeting in Connecticut. They were married against the wishes of Florence's aunts, the Misses Hurlbird, and immediately left for Europe. On the boat trip to Europe, Florence feigned a heart condition, and her pretend heart condition keeps them forever trapped on the European continent. While Dowell and Florence lived in Paris, Florence has an affair with a low-class artist named Jimmy, but Dowell knows nothing about it. Dowell's own marriage to Florence has remained unconsummated for thirteen years.
After Florence's nine-year affair with Edward, she plans to divorce Dowell and marry Edward. But one night, August 4, 1913, Florence sees Edward in the park alone at night with his young ward, Nancy. She grows insanely jealous and runs back to the hotel, only to find an old acquaintance, Mr. Bagshawe, telling Dowell about Florence's indecent relationship with Jimmy many years ago. Part II ends with the discovery of Florence's dead body; she has poisoned herself.
Part 3 opens with Dowell considering marriage to Nancy, the Ashburnhams"" young ward. But Edward, too, is in love with her. Nancy, who has recently left convent school, admires her uncle immensely for his heroic deeds and she assumes he and Leonora have a healthy marriage; she is not in love with him in the same way. After Florence's death, Leonora, Edward, and Nancy all return to Branshaw Manor in England. There, Leonora has a nervous breakdown, since she surmises that Edward is in love with Nancy. In this section, Dowell narrates the entire history of Edward and Leonora's marriage. Through all his affairs, Leonora always hoped that Edward would return to her and love her again. But when Edward began his affair with Florence, Leonora's love died.
In Part 4, Leonora realizes that Nancy is safe from Edward. She sees that the small amount of sexual morality that her husband possesses will keep him from starting an affair with Nancy. She has a breakdown and tells Nancy what a terrible husband Edward is. Nancy's ideals are crushed, and her eyes are opened to the realities of the world. Dowell says that together, Leonora and Nancy begin to slowly torture of Edward. He suffers greatly and plans for Nancy to travel to India to live with her father. She sends a telegram from India saying she is having a good time. Edward is crushed. All he desires is to have her worship him from afar. Edward commits suicide by stabbing himself with a penknife. Leonora remarries a ""perfectly normal"" man named Rodney Bayham and they have a child. Nancy goes mad. The only word she can say is ""shuttlecock."" Dowell buys Branshaw Manor and becomes Nancy's permanent caretaker."
Prisons,"Lawyer Bryan Stevenson gives a first-person account of his decades helping marginalized Americans who have been unfairly and harshly punished by the U.S. criminal justice system, which disproportionately targets people of color and poor people. At the heart of Just Mercy is the story of Walter McMillian, a Black man who was framed for the murder of a girl named Ronda Morrison, convicted, and sent to death row. 
Stevenson alternates chapters about Walter with his personal reflections on our country’s history with racial disparity and issues around incarceration. Stevenson highlights other groups of vulnerable people who have been victimized by the criminal justice system and shares the stories of the prisoners he has helped over the years. The book also follows the growth of Stevenson’s nonprofit law project, the Alabama-based Equal Justice Initiative (EJI), through its expansion from focusing on death row prisoners to helping people sentenced to life without parole. Stevenson chronicles how EJI becomes a significant force in criminal justice reform.
In 1983 as a law student, Stevenson discovers his life’s passion when he interns with the Georgia-based Southern Prisoners Defense Committee and meets his first death row prisoner. After graduation Stevenson accepts a job with the organization to represent poor prisoners, including those in Alabama who lack any public defender. He meets Walter McMillian on Alabama’s death row. Walter owns a successful business but also transgresses racial boundaries when he has an affair with a white woman. Soon after the affair becomes public, the woman’s friend, Ralph Myers, accuses Walter of committing the unsolved murder of Ronda Morrison, which has outraged the community. Law enforcement, including a racist sheriff and the district attorney, eagerly pounces on this accusation, overlooking Walter’s alibi and a lack of evidence. Instead, they actively force Ralph to stick with his story even when he tries to recant. They coerce other false witness testimonies, and—as revealed years later—actively suppress evidence.
After Stevenson and the team at EJI unsuccessfully appeal Walter’s conviction, they launch their own investigation of the crime and uncover new evidence. They find witnesses who can prove the witnesses against Walter lied as well as financial records that indicate that one of these witnesses was paid to give false testimony. Stevenson and his team also petition for and receive all records from Walter’s trial. However, their big break comes when they receive a phone call from Ralph, who now wants to make amends. Ralph admits to lying about Walter and says he was threatened by law enforcement. Stevenson wins a hearing for Walter where he can present his new evidence: Ralph’s testimony, which is confirmed by health care workers and other inmates, as well as recordings of the law enforcement team threatening Ralph if he doesn’t frame Walter. 
While the judge refuses to grant Walter relief, Stevenson continues the appeal process through the Alabama courts. The district attorney asks outside agents to investigate the murder for which Walter was convicted, and the investigators determine that Walter had nothing to do with the crime. Six weeks later, the court invalidates Walter’s conviction. Stevenson and the State file a joint motion to dismiss the charges, and Walter is set free.
Throughout the process, Stevenson and Walter become close friends, and Stevenson helps Walter upon his release, including filing a civil suit on his behalf and offering him a place to stay. Walter works with Stevenson to share his story, giving interviews and speaking at legal conferences, and Walter is even featured in a documentary. Unfortunately, Walter is diagnosed with advancing dementia and is forced to rely on family and eventually a nursing facility for his care. He dies in 2013. Stevenson gives a eulogy at his funeral and shares all he learned from Walter, particularly that we must extend mercy to everyone, even those who have not earned it.
Interspersed with chapters chronicling Walter’s narrative are stories of Stevenson’s other clients and work. His closeness with these prisoners and their horrifying circumstances makes Stevenson more determined to help and causes him to reflect on abstract issues that nevertheless imbue the criminal justice system, like humanity and mercy. Stevenson focuses on several categories of vulnerable people who become trapped in the system, including mentally ill prisoners, disabled prisoners, and poor women who give birth to stillborn babies. 
Stevenson and his team at EJI also become increasingly focused on juvenile offenders who are sometimes tried as adults despite their young age. These offenders may be given de facto death sentences by being sentenced to life without parole and face perilous circumstances when they are housed in adult prisons. Stevenson illustrates how these prisoners retain their own humanity while being forced to live under inhumane conditions. He also discusses some of the qualities common among these types of prisoners: They are generally poor and disproportionately people of color, and most of them lack adequate legal counsel. The juveniles have horrific backgrounds of abuse and neglect.
Stevenson and his team at EJI also work to change the legal system to offer more protection to marginalized people. Several of his cases end up before the U.S. Supreme Court, and he succeeds in winning rulings that ban as unconstitutional the conviction of children to life without parole and the execution of people deemed incompetent from dementia or neurological disease. EJI works to raise public awareness of issues surrounding unfair incarceration, produces groundbreaking reports on racial issues, and sets up programs to help formerly incarcerated people adjust to life on the outside.
Stevenson also reflects on the issues that surround the criminal justice system. His time spent with prisoners awaiting their execution makes him realize how inhumane it is to prepare another human to die. After decades of work, when Stevenson fails to prevent the execution of a man who suffers from an intellectual disability, he momentarily feels unable to continue his work. However, he realizes that he cannot help but be broken by his experiences and comes to understand that it is his own brokenness that allows him to more fully understand the need for mercy and to bring compassion to others. The book ends with Stevenson’s renewed commitment to helping others."
Rekindle,"Nick Carraway, a young man from Minnesota, moves to New York in the summer of 1922 to learn about the bond business. He rents a house in the West Egg district of Long Island, a wealthy but unfashionable area populated by the new rich, a group who have made their fortunes too recently to have established social connections and who are prone to garish displays of wealth. Nick’s next-door neighbor in West Egg is a mysterious man named Jay Gatsby, who lives in a gigantic Gothic mansion and throws extravagant parties every Saturday night.
Nick is unlike the other inhabitants of West Egg—he was educated at Yale and has social connections in East Egg, a fashionable area of Long Island home to the established upper class. Nick drives out to East Egg one evening for dinner with his cousin, Daisy Buchanan, and her husband, Tom, an erstwhile classmate of Nick’s at Yale. Daisy and Tom introduce Nick to Jordan Baker, a beautiful, cynical young woman with whom Nick begins a romantic relationship. Nick also learns a bit about Daisy and Tom’s marriage: Jordan tells him that Tom has a lover, Myrtle Wilson, who lives in the valley of ashes, a gray industrial dumping ground between West Egg and New York City. Not long after this revelation, Nick travels to New York City with Tom and Myrtle. At a vulgar, gaudy party in the apartment that Tom keeps for the affair, Myrtle begins to taunt Tom about Daisy, and Tom responds by breaking her nose.
As the summer progresses, Nick eventually garners an invitation to one of Gatsby’s legendary parties. He encounters Jordan Baker at the party, and they meet Gatsby himself, a surprisingly young man who affects an English accent, has a remarkable smile, and calls everyone “old sport.” Gatsby asks to speak to Jordan alone, and, through Jordan, Nick later learns more about his mysterious neighbor. Gatsby tells Jordan that he knew Daisy in Louisville in 1917 and is deeply in love with her. He spends many nights staring at the green light at the end of her dock, across the bay from his mansion. Gatsby’s extravagant lifestyle and wild parties are simply an attempt to impress Daisy. Gatsby now wants Nick to arrange a reunion between himself and Daisy, but he is afraid that Daisy will refuse to see him if she knows that he still loves her. Nick invites Daisy to have tea at his house, without telling her that Gatsby will also be there. After an initially awkward reunion, Gatsby and Daisy reestablish their connection. Their love rekindled, they begin an affair.
After a short time, Tom grows increasingly suspicious of his wife’s relationship with Gatsby. At a luncheon at the Buchanans’ house, Gatsby stares at Daisy with such undisguised passion that Tom realizes Gatsby is in love with her. Though Tom is himself involved in an extramarital affair, he is deeply outraged by the thought that his wife could be unfaithful to him. He forces the group to drive into New York City, where he confronts Gatsby in a suite at the Plaza Hotel. Tom asserts that he and Daisy have a history that Gatsby could never understand, and he announces to his wife that Gatsby is a criminal—his fortune comes from bootlegging alcohol and other illegal activities. Daisy realizes that her allegiance is to Tom, and Tom contemptuously sends her back to East Egg with Gatsby, attempting to prove that Gatsby cannot hurt him.
When Nick, Jordan, and Tom drive through the valley of ashes, however, they discover that Gatsby’s car has struck and killed Myrtle, Tom’s lover. They rush back to Long Island, where Nick learns from Gatsby that Daisy was driving the car when it struck Myrtle, but that Gatsby intends to take the blame. The next day, Tom tells Myrtle’s husband, George, that Gatsby was the driver of the car. George, who has leapt to the conclusion that the driver of the car that killed Myrtle must have been her lover, finds Gatsby in the pool at his mansion and shoots him dead. He then fatally shoots himself.
Nick stages a small funeral for Gatsby, ends his relationship with Jordan, and moves back to the Midwest to escape the disgust he feels for the people surrounding Gatsby’s life and for the emptiness and moral decay of life among the wealthy on the East Coast. Nick reflects that just as Gatsby’s dream of Daisy was corrupted by money and dishonesty, the American dream of happiness and individualism has disintegrated into the mere pursuit of wealth. Though Gatsby’s power to transform his dreams into reality is what makes him “great,” Nick reflects that the era of dreaming—both Gatsby’s dream and the American dream—is over."
Sensed,"In Common Sense, Thomas Paine argues for American independence. His argument begins with more general, theoretical reflections about government and religion, then progresses onto the specifics of the colonial situation.
Paine begins by distinguishing between government and society. Society, according to Paine, is everything constructive and good that people join together to accomplish. Government, on the other hand, is an institution whose sole purpose is to protect us from our own vices. Government has its origins in the evil of man and is therefore a necessary evil at best. Paine says that government's sole purpose is to protect life, liberty and property, and that a government should be judged solely on the basis of the extent to which it accomplishes this goal.
Paine then considers an imagined scenario in which a small group of people has been placed on an island, and cut off from the rest of society. In time, these people develop ties with one another, and lawmaking becomes inevitable. Paine says the people will be much happier if they are responsible for the creation of the laws that rule them. Paine is also implicitly arguing that such a system of representation is also better for the American colonists. Having expressed his disagreement with British reign in America, Paine proceeds to launch a general attack on the British system of government. Paine says the British system is too complex and rife with contradictions, and that the monarchy is granted far too much power. The British system pretends to offer a reasonable system of checks and balances, but in fact, it does not.
From here Paine moves on to discuss, in general, the notions of monarchy and hereditary succession. Man, Pain argues, was born into a state of equality, and the distinction that has arisen between king and subject is an unnatural one. At first, Paine says, the world was without kings, but the ancient Jews decided they wanted a king. This angered God, but he allowed them to have one. Paine presents pages of biblical evidence detailing God's wrath at the idea of the Jews having a king. The conclusion Paine reaches is that the practice of monarchy originates from sin, and is an institution that the Bible and God condemn. Paine calls hereditary succession an abominable practice. He says that even if people were to choose to have a king, that does not legitimize that King's child acting as a future ruler. Furthermore, hereditary succession has brought with it innumerable evils, such as incompetent kings, corruption, and civil war.
Having dispensed with the preliminary theoretical issues, Paine sets in to discuss the details of the American situation. In response to the argument that America has flourished under British rule, and therefore ought to stay under the king, Paine says that such an argument fails to realize that America has evolved and no longer needs Britain's help. Some say that Britain has protected America, and therefore deserves allegiance, but Paine responds that Britain has only watched over America in order to secure its own economic well-being. Paine adds that most recently, instead of watching over the colonies, the British have been attacking them, and are therefore undeserving of American loyalty.
Paine says that the colonies have little to gain from remaining attached to Britain. Commerce can be better conducted with the rest of Europe, but only after America becomes independent. Paine also asserts that if the colonies remain attached to Britain, the same problems that have arisen in the past will arise in the future. Paine argues that it is necessary to seek independence now, as to do otherwise would only briefly cover up problems that will surely reemerge.
Paine even proposes the form of government that the independent colonies should adopt. His recommendation is for a representative democracy that gives roughly equal weight to each of the colonies.
Paine explains why the current time is a good time to break free of Britain. Primarily, Paine focuses on the present size of the colonies, and on their current capabilities. He presents an inventory of the British Navy and gives calculations revealing how America could build a navy of comparable size. Paine recommends this as a way of ensuring America's security and prosperity in trade. Paine also argues that America is sufficiently small as to be united now. If time were to elapse, and the population of the colonies to grow, the same feeling of unity would not be present. Paine adds that if the Americans revolt now, they can use the vast expanses of uncharted land to the West in order to pay down some of the debt they will incur.
Paine says that as a colony of Britain, America lacks respectability on the international scene. They are seen simply as rebels, and cannot form substantial alliances with other nations. In order to prosper in the long term, the colonies need to be independent. Paine says that, by declaring independence, America will be able to ask for the help of other countries in its struggle for freedom. For all of these reasons, Paine says it is imperative and urgent that the colonies declare independence."

Having expressed his disagreement with British reign in America, Paine proceeds to launch a general attack on the British system of government. Paine says the British system is too complex and rife with contradictions, and that the monarchy is granted far too much power. The British system pretends to offer a reasonable system of checks and balances, but in fact, it does not.
From here Paine moves on to discuss, in general, the notions of monarchy and hereditary succession. Man, Pain argues, was born into a state of equality, and the distinction that has arisen between king and subject is an unnatural one. At first, Paine says, the world was without kings, but the ancient Jews decided they wanted a king. This angered God, but he allowed them to have one. Paine presents pages of biblical evidence detailing God's wrath at the idea of the Jews having a king. The conclusion Paine reaches is that the practice of monarchy originates from sin, and is an institution that the Bible and God condemn. Paine calls hereditary succession an abominable practice. He says that even if people were to choose to have a king, that does not legitimize that King's child acting as a future ruler. Furthermore, hereditary succession has brought with it innumerable evils, such as incompetent kings, corruption, and civil war.
Having dispensed with the preliminary theoretical issues, Paine sets in to discuss the details of the American situation. In response to the argument that America has flourished under British rule, and therefore ought to stay under the king, Paine says that such an argument fails to realize that America has evolved and no longer needs Britain's help. Some say that Britain has protected America, and therefore deserves allegiance, but Paine responds that Britain has only watched over America in order to secure its own economic well-being. Paine adds that most recently, instead of watching over the colonies, the British have been attacking them, and are therefore undeserving of American loyalty.
Paine says that the colonies have little to gain from remaining attached to Britain. Commerce can be better conducted with the rest of Europe, but only after America becomes independent. Paine also asserts that if the colonies remain attached to Britain, the same problems that have arisen in the past will arise in the future. Paine argues that it is necessary to seek independence now, as to do otherwise would only briefly cover up problems that will surely reemerge.
Paine even proposes the form of government that the independent colonies should adopt. His recommendation is for a representative democracy that gives roughly equal weight to each of the colonies.
Paine explains why the current time is a good time to break free of Britain. Primarily, Paine focuses on the present size of the colonies, and on their current capabilities. He presents an inventory of the British Navy and gives calculations revealing how America could build a navy of comparable size. Paine recommends this as a way of ensuring America's security and prosperity in trade. Paine also argues that America is sufficiently small as to be united now. If time were to elapse, and the population of the colonies to grow, the same feeling of unity would not be present. Paine adds that if the Americans revolt now, they can use the vast expanses of uncharted land to the West in order to pay down some of the debt they will incur.
Paine says that as a colony of Britain, America lacks respectability on the international scene. They are seen simply as rebels, and cannot form substantial alliances with other nations. In order to prosper in the long term, the colonies need to be independent. Paine says that, by declaring independence, America will be able to ask for the help of other countries in its struggle for freedom. For all of these reasons, Paine says it is imperative and urgent that the colonies declare independence."
Stars,"Number the Stars is told from the point of view of ten-year-old Annemarie Johansen. The story is set in the city of Copenhagen, Denmark in September 1943, the third year of the Nazi occupation of Denmark. Annemarie and her best friend Ellen, who is Jewish, are stopped by soldiers on their way home from school. The two girls, who go to the same school and live in the same building, are unsettled by their first direct encounter with the Germans. Mrs. Johansen and Mrs. Rosen are concerned and ask the girls to take a new route to school. The encounter makes Annemarie reflect on what her father has taught her about Denmark and also about her older sister Lise's death a few years before the start of the novel. Later in the fall, Annemarie and her younger sister Kirsti discover that Mrs. Hirsch's neighborhood shop has been closed. This event further alarms Mrs. Johansen, though Annemarie does not understand why.
During a late night visit from Peter Neilsen, a member of the Resistance and the man Lise was to marry, Annemarie is told more about the war. Her parents and Peter explain that Jewish stores are being closed. The next day, the Rosens must flee. They leave Ellen with the Johansens. During the night, German soldiers come to the apartment demanding that Mr. Johansen disclose the location of his friends. He refuses and they search the apartment. Ellen pretends to be one of the Johansen's daughters, but her dark hair causes the solider to be suspicious. Luckily, Mr. Johansen is able to show them a baby picture of Lise with dark hair, which convinces the soldiers.
The next day, Mrs. Johansen takes the three girls to her brother Henrik's home in Gilleleje, Denmark, where Henrik is a fisherman. They spend a peaceful day in the house by the ocean before Henrik announces that their Great-aunt Birte has died. The service is to be held that evening. Annemarie knows that no such aunt exists, and demands the truth. Uncle Henrik explains the importance of not knowing too much when bravery is needed. That night the coffin arrives and they gather around it. Many more people arrive, but all are silent. Soon Peter appears with the Rosens, who are reunited with Ellen. Soldiers, drawn by the post-curfew lights, come to the house. They demand that the coffin be opened, a problem since the coffin is empty. Mrs. Johansen thinks quickly and says that her aunt died of highly contagious typhus. The soldiers leave.
Henrik takes the first group of people down to his boat. Mrs. Johansen follows with the Rosens. Annemarie, who now understands that the people are being taken to safety in Sweden, awaits her mother's safe return. When her mother does not appear, she discovers that Mrs. Johansen has broken her ankle. Because of this, Annemarie must take an important package to her uncle before they can leave. On the way to the boat, soldiers with dogs stop her. They search her basket and discover the package. But when they rip it open it contains only a handkerchief, and they let her go. Annemarie makes it to the boat in time, to Henrik's evident relief.
That evening, Henrik is safe at home having dinner with Annemarie, Kirsti, and Mrs. Johansen, whose ankle has been taken care of by the local doctor. After dinner, Uncle Henrik takes Annemarie to learn how to milk the cow. They talk about the events of the day. He explains that he hid his passengers in the bottom of the boat, and the handkerchief was essential because it kept the Germans' dogs from smelling the human cargo. Uncle Henrik praises Annemarie for her bravery and reassures her that Ellen is safe and they will meet again someday.
The war ends in May, and Annemarie and her family watch from their balcony as people parade in the streets with the Danish flag. Annemarie thinks of the Rosens and realizes that they, along with all the others who were forced to flee, will soon be returning home. Peter Nielsen has died. He was shot in a public square for his involvement in the Resistance. Annemarie's parents tell her that Lise was a member of the Resistance, too, and that she did not die in an accident, but was killed by the Germans. Thinking of Lise and of Ellen, Annemarie goes to the trunk of Lise's things in her room and takes out the Star of David pendant that she has been keeping for Ellen. She says she will wear the necklace herself until Ellen returns."
Addâ,"From the Underworld, Penelope, wife of Odysseus, decides to tell at last her version of the events that have been immortalized in the Odyssey. Penelope’s Twelve Maids, who were hanged by Odysseus and his and Penelope’s son, Telemachus, also provide commentary on the events in the form of a Greek chorus. Penelope starts by telling of her childhood. She was born to King Icarius of Sparta and a woman who was a Naiad, or half nymph. When Penelope was a baby, her father tried to have her drowned. Penelope was saved by a flock of ducks, but her father’s motivation for having her killed is still unknown to her. After this incident, along with the coldness of her mother, Penelope learned to be suspicious of other people. The Maids contrast their own childhood with Penelope’s, showing how much they suffered compared to Penelope’s privileged, if lonely, youth. At the age of fifteen, several men compete in a race to win Penelope’s hand in marriage. Odysseus, a king from the far-off island of Ithaca, cheats with the help of Penelope’s uncle to win the race. After their marriage, Odysseus and Penelope make the journey to Ithaca. The Maids comment on how they would like to have the opportunity to marry a prince.
    
While Penelope falls in love with Odysseus, she is lonely in Ithaca with no female companions. A year after she gives birth to Telemachus, Odysseus and Penelope receive word that Penelope’s cousin Helen, who is married to King Menelaus, has run away with a Trojan prince, Paris. Several men, including Odysseus, had sworn an oath that they would protect Menelaus’s right to Helen, and so Menelaus plans to go to war with Troy. When he and his men come to enlist Odysseus, Odysseus feigns madness, acting like a peasant plowing the fields. However, one of the men puts baby Telemachus in Odysseus’s path, forcing him to redirect the plow and show that he is sane after all. Odysseus is forced to go to war. Over the next ten years, Penelope hears stories of the war, which finally ends when Odysseus proposes sneaking soldiers into the city of Troy via a wooden horse. However, Odysseus still does not return home. In his absence, several Suitors arrive at the palace, hoping to marry Penelope to access her wealth. 
Hoping to buy time until Odysseus returns home, Penelope tells the Suitors she cannot choose a new husband until she finishes weaving a funeral shroud for her father-in-law, Laertes. While she weaves during the day, at night, she and her twelve most trusted Maids unravel the shroud so that she does not make any progress on it. Penelope also enlists the Maids to infiltrate the Suitors by spending time with them and speaking badly of Penelope and Telemachus. The Maids follow her orders and are either raped or seduced by the Suitors. While Penelope feels bad about this, she finds the information they give her too valuable to ask them to stop. However, the Suitors discover from one of the Maids that Penelope has been deceiving them with the shroud. She then promises to finish it quickly and then select a husband.
Soon after, Odysseus returns to Ithaca disguised as a beggar. Penelope recognizes him but feigns ignorance for the sake of his pride. She suggests an archery competition among the Suitors, knowing only Odysseus would be able to string his bow. While Penelope is asleep in her room, likely drugged, Odysseus wins the archery competition, throws off his disguise, and murders the Suitors. He then orders his childhood nurse, Eurycleia, to point out the Maids who had been disloyal to him. Eurycleia points out Penelope’s Twelve Maids, and Odysseus and Telemachus hang them. Odysseus then reveals his true identity to Penelope, who acts surprised to see him, before leaving on another journey to cleanse himself of the murders of the Suitors and the Maids. In their chapters, the Maids discuss their murders both in an anthropology lecture and in a trial. However, Odysseus is not punished for his crimes against them. 
In the Underworld, Penelope has never been able to talk with the Maids, who avoid her. She remains around the fields of asphodel, occasionally meeting Helen, whom she still blames for the Trojan War, and the Suitors, who blame her for their deaths. Penelope reunites with Odysseus whenever one of his new lives ends. He always chooses to be reborn into the world of the living as the Maids come after him, haunting him in both the Underworld and on earth."
Candidates,"Candide is the illegitimate nephew of a German baron. He grows up in the baron’s castle under the tutelage of the scholar Pangloss, who teaches him that this world is “the best of all possible worlds.” Candide falls in love with the baron’s young daughter, Cunégonde. The baron catches the two kissing and expels Candide from his home. On his own for the first time, Candide is soon conscripted into the army of the Bulgars. He wanders away from camp for a brief walk, and is brutally flogged as a deserter. After witnessing a horrific battle, he manages to escape and travels to Holland.
	In Holland, a kindly Anabaptist named Jacques takes Candide in. Candide runs into a deformed beggar and discovers that it is Pangloss. Pangloss explains that he has contracted syphilis and that Cunégonde and her family have all been brutally murdered by the Bulgar army. Nonetheless, he maintains his optimistic outlook. Jacques takes Pangloss in as well. The three travel to Lisbon together, but before they arrive their ship runs into a storm and Jacques is drowned. Candide and Pangloss arrive in Lisbon to find it destroyed by an earthquake and under the control of the Inquisition. Pangloss is soon hanged as a heretic, and Candide is flogged for listening with approval to Pangloss’s philosophy. After his beating, an old woman dresses Candide’s wounds and then, to his astonishment, takes him to Cunégonde. Cunégonde explains that though the Bulgars killed the rest of her family, she was merely raped and then captured by a captain, who sold her to a Jew named Don Isaachar. At present, she is a sex slave jointly owned by Don Isaachar and the Grand Inquisitor of Lisbon. Each of Cunégonde’s two owners arrive in turn as she and Candide are talking, and Candide kills them both. Terrified, Candide, the old woman, and Cunégonde flee and board a ship bound for South America. During their journey, the old woman relates her own story. She was born the Pope’s daughter but has suffered a litany of misfortunes that include rape, enslavement, and cannibalism.
	Candide and Cunégonde plan to marry, but as soon as they arrive in Buenos Aires, the governor, Don Fernando, proposes to Cunégonde. Thinking of her own financial welfare, she accepts. Authorities looking for the murderer of the Grand Inquisitor arrive from Portugal in pursuit of Candide. Along with a newly acquired valet named Cacambo, Candide flees to territory controlled by Jesuits who are revolting against the Spanish government. After demanding an audience with a Jesuit commander, Candide discovers that the commander is Cunégonde’s brother, the baron, who also managed to escape from the Bulgars. Candide announces that he plans to marry Cunégonde, but the baron insists that his sister will never marry a commoner. Enraged, Candide runs the baron through with his sword. He and Cacambo escape into the wilderness, where they narrowly avoid being eaten by a native tribe called the Biglugs.
	After traveling for days, Candide and Cacambo find themselves in the land of Eldorado, where gold and jewels litter the streets. This utopian country has advanced scientific knowledge, no religious conflict, no court system, and places no value on its plentiful gold and jewels. But Candide longs to return to Cunégonde, and after a month in Eldorado he and Cacambo depart with countless invaluable jewels loaded onto swift pack sheep. When they reach the territory of Surinam, Candide sends Cacambo to Buenos Aires with instructions to use part of the fortune to purchase Cunégonde from Don Fernando and then to meet him in Venice. An unscrupulous merchant named Vanderdendur steals much of Candide’s fortune, dampening his optimism somewhat. Frustrated, Candide sails off to France with a specially chosen companion, an unrepentantly pessimistic scholar named Martin. On the way there, he recovers part of his fortune when a Spanish captain sinks Vanderdendur’s ship. Candide takes this as proof that there is justice in the world, but Martin staunchly disagrees.
	In Paris, Candide and Martin mingle with the social elite. Candide’s fortune attracts a number of hangers-on, several of whom succeed in filching jewels from him. Candide and Martin proceed to Venice, where, to Candide’s dismay, Cunégonde and Cacambo are nowhere to be found. However, they do encounter other colorful individuals there, including Paquette, the chambermaid-turned-prostitute who gave Pangloss syphilis, and Count Pococurante, a wealthy Venetian who is hopelessly bored with the cultural treasures that surround him. Eventually, Cacambo, now a slave of a deposed Turkish monarch, surfaces. He explains that Cunégonde is in Constantinople, having herself been enslaved along with the old woman. Martin, Cacambo, and Candide depart for Turkey, where Candide purchases Cacambo’s freedom.
	Candide discovers Pangloss and the baron in a Turkish chain gang. Both have actually survived their apparent deaths and, after suffering various misfortunes, arrived in Turkey. Despite everything, Pangloss remains an optimist. An overjoyed Candide purchases their freedom, and he and his growing retinue go on to find Cunégonde and the old woman. Cunégonde has grown ugly since Candide last saw her, but he purchases her freedom anyway. He also buys the old woman’s freedom and purchases a farm outside of Constantinople. He keeps his longstanding promise to marry Cunégonde, but only after being forced to send the baron, who still cannot abide his sister marrying a commoner, back to the chain gang. Candide, Cunégonde, Cacambo, Pangloss, and the old woman settle into a comfortable life on the farm but soon find themselves growing bored and quarrelsome. Finally, Candide encounters a farmer who lives a simple life, works hard, and avoids vice and leisure. Inspired, Candide and his friends take to cultivating a garden in earnest. All their time and energy goes into the work, and none is left over for philosophical speculation. At last everyone is fulfilled and happy."
Webster,"Band of Brothers: E Company, 506th Regiment, 101st Airborne from Normandy to Hitler's Eagle's Nest is a focused analysis of one of the most prolific war units the United States of America has ever produced, the legendary Easy Company of the 101st Airborne Parachute Infantry Regiment (PIR). Taken from the detailed accounts of campaigns assembled by U.S. Armed Forces historians and first-person accounts, the nonfiction book retells the journey of Easy Company through the eyes of the men who served. From their early days training stateside through to their ultimate victory over the German fighting forces, the book traces the influence Easy Company of the 506th Airborne Division had in shaping the outcome of World War II.
The story starts with the selection of the men for Easy Company. At the time, the PIR is a new type of fighting unit, paratroopers. It is all volunteer because of the extreme training required for the danger the men would be facing. The soldiers who survive the try-out process are profiled as a group of street-savvy pragmatists who figure their best chance to survive the war would be in the company of the best-trained men. The role of leadership in shaping them into efficient soldiers falls to officers with various strengths and weaknesses, both of which contribute to the men’s development. Basic training turns these soldiers into fit infantrymen, and jump school challenges the men to overcome their instincts for safety and learn to love jumping out of airplanes.
After rigorous training, Easy Company leaves the States for England, where the men participate in simulations for D-Day. There they learn that the reality of combat includes the unexpected and the unknown, and their training in flexible response to combat conditions comes to the fore on their first jump on D-Day. Normandy presents on-the-job training in “kill-or-be-killed,” and Lt. Dick Winters begins his career in Easy Company as a brilliant strategist. The bloody battles of Carentan follow as Easy Company learns to capture and hold a town. The men experience failures of nerve and must force themselves into bravery. Their bravado has had a reality check in France, and they must rely on their past training to mentally push through their fears and self-doubts.
Easy Company next deploys to Holland on an ill-conceived operation to secure “hell’s highway,” a road needed for strategic Allied troop movements into Germany. They are met with overwhelming force in the form of fifty-tank German Panzer units and infantry. Although they were at first welcomed by the Dutch civilians as liberators, the Allied soldiers must later watch the people withdraw into silent despair as they fail to hold the towns from German occupation. Easy Company and other Allied soldiers receive orders to travel to “the island,” a five-kilometer-wide area between the Rhine River on the north and the Waal River to the south, captured three weeks earlier. Easy Company’s task is to defend the position from counterattacks, support the British artillery by turning back any German infantry assaults, and serve as forward artillery observers. They push back a 100-man German SS unit, but they lose fifty men to artillery fire before they are relieved by a Canadian division.
In Mourmelon, France, Easy Company’s rest and recovery come to an abrupt end when U.S. Commander Eisenhower sends them to meet Hitler’s surprise offensive in the Ardennes area in Belgium. This event goes down in history as the Battle of the Bulge. In the hasty deployment, the Allied soldiers go to Bastogne to face subzero temperatures and snowy conditions without adequate winter clothing or ammunition. They scrounge bullets from the traumatized retreating American troops they are replacing. The Germans surround Bastogne and pound their position with artillery that inflicts horrible casualties. The siege cuts off Allied soldiers from food and ammunition resupply until General Patton’s tank division breaks the blockade. Easy Company captures Bastogne, Noville, and Rachamps, cutting off the German advance. The bloody campaign brings on combat fatigue, and many soldiers reach their psychological breaking point. The American troops lose half their men.
The Germans launch an operation in Alsace, 160 miles southeast of Bastogne, to draw American troops from the Ardennes area. Easy Company deploys to hold the line in the town of Haguenau on the Moder River and serve as forward artillery observers. They conduct a covert patrol and capture two Germans to use as informants on the enemy’s plan, position, and resources.
Easy Company returns to Mourmelon to rest and resupply and finds that many of their personal items stored there during the campaign in Bastogne have been stolen by other soldiers. Recruits from the States replace their comrades who had fallen in battle, and the veterans train with the enthusiastic replacements to bring them to battle readiness. The division prepares for Operation Eclipse, a drop on and around Berlin, planned for after the Allied armies have crossed the Rhine. To support their advance, the British-American Operation Varsity drops three airborne divisions into the Ruhr area of Germany, where they encounter stiff German resistance. As support, Commander Eisenhower sends the 101st Airborne by truck to Remagen to eliminate this resistance. Easy Company, for the first time, operates in Germany and gets to know the citizens. As the war winds down, they see thousands of survivors living amid hundreds of skeletal corpses left where they fell at the Dachau forced labor camp.
When the Germans formally surrender to Commander Eisenhower, Easy Company is busy securing the Nazi high command’s homes in Berchtesgaden. After learning about their victory, the men celebrate with German fighter pilot Hermann Goering’s champagne. The men next go to Austria to supervise the surrender and processing of German troops before finally making their way home to the United States. The book ends with the stories of their lives after their return."
Incredibly,"Oskar Schell, a nine-year-old boy, has not been happy since his dad died in the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Unbeknownst to anyone except for Oskar, on the day of the attacks, Oskar’s dad called the house five times. Oskar was home for the fifth call but couldn’t bring himself to pick up the phone. They never recovered his dad’s body and buried an empty casket at his funeral. Oskar is furious that his mom has started to spend time with a man named Ron and worries that she has begun to move on. Oskar suffers from extreme anxiety and imagines whimsical inventions in order to cope. One night, he decides to look through his dad’s closet and sees a vase hidden on the top shelf. In trying to retrieve it, Oskar drops the vase, and when it shatters, he finds an envelope labeled “Black” that contains a strange key. After doing some research, Oskar decides to visit every person with the last name Black in New York City to try and discover what the key opens.
There is also a parallel storyline about Oskar’s grandparents. The novel includes letters from Oskar’s grandpa, Thomas, to his dad, and letters that his grandma writes to him. Thomas stops speaking not long after immigrating to America out of grief for Anna, his lost love who died in the bombing of Dresden. Thomas communicates by writing one-line sentences in notebooks. He explains that Grandma, Anna’s sister whose name we never learn, encountered him in a bakery and asked him to marry her. Grandma writes her own version of their meeting, which doesn’t quite match up with Thomas’s account. According to Grandma, when she reunited with Thomas, he asked her to pose for a sculpture. She agreed and started going to his apartment daily to pose. Although he started touching her for longer and longer in order to get her into the position he wanted, the sculpture still looked like Anna. Eventually, they had sex, and Grandma proposed. Throughout their marriage, they divide up their apartment into “Nothing” places, where they can go to not exist, and “Something” places. However, the lines blur. After Grandma becomes pregnant, Thomas leaves for Dresden because he doesn’t want to keep living any longer.
Early in Oskar’s search for the key, he meets Abby Black, an epidemiologist who lives in Greenwich Village. Throughout their conversation, he hears a man yelling from the next room, but Abby ignores him. Abby claims to know nothing about the key, but Oskar notices she seems to hold something back. Nevertheless, his search continues alphabetically down his list of people named Black. He eventually meets a man only referred to as Mr. Black, who lives in the apartment right above Oskar’s. Mr. Black is 103 years old, very wise, and hard of hearing. Oskar invites him to join him in the quest for the key, but Mr. Black hasn’t left the house in the twenty-three years since his wife’s death, and he’s turned off his hearing aids. He allows Oskar to turn his hearing aids back on. From then on, Mr. Black accompanies Oskar on his travels through the city, encouraging Oskar to get over his fear of public transportation. After they meet with Ruth Black, who lives in the Empire State Building, Mr. Black tells Oskar he’s done searching for the lock. Oskar is devastated.
Thomas returns to New York after 9/11 with a desire to try and live again. Grandma at first wants him neither to stay nor leave, but she eventually allows him to stay in the guestroom. She makes him promise never to let Oskar know he’s there. After Thomas sees Oskar for the first time, he starts following him around from a distance. Mr. Black eventually confronts Thomas and tries to protect Oskar. When Thomas explains who he is, Mr. Black tells him that he should be the one going around with Oskar. Not long after, Oskar finds Thomas in Grandma’s apartment and assumes him to be Grandma’s mysterious renter. Oskar tells Thomas the story of the key and plays him the messages his dad left on the answering machine. Thomas tells Oskar if he ever needs him to toss stones at his window. Oskar later asks Thomas to help him dig up his dad’s grave. Thomas agrees, and they bury Thomas’s unsent letters to his son in the grave. Afterward, Thomas tries to leave Grandma again, but she follows him to the airport. He doesn’t want to stay or leave, so they stay there, writing.
Not long after Oskar meets Thomas, he notices that there has been a single message on his family’s answering machine for months. He listens to it and discovers that Abby Black called him because she had information about the key. He returns to her house and learns that the key belongs to her ex-husband, William. Furthermore, Oskar’s mom knew about Oskar’s key quest all along and had called Abby Black, along with many of the other Blacks, to tell them Oskar was going to be coming. Confused and frustrated, Oskar goes to William's office. William explains that the key unlocks a safety deposit box that William’s deceased father left for him. William didn’t realize the key was in the vase until after he’d sold the vase to Oskar’s dad at an estate sale. Disappointed that the key had nothing to do with his dad, Oskar goes home. He formulates a plan to dig up his dad’s grave. He looks at a series of photographs he has of a man falling from the World Trade Center. He reorders the photographs so that the man floats back up and imagines his last night with his dad playing out in reverse."
Or,"As a huntress and her family’s primary source of survival, nineteen-year-old Feyre stalks the bleak woods, a little farther from home than usual. Her family was once very wealthy, but they now live in poverty. Feyre’s luck turns when she spots a deer. At the same time, an enormous wolf appears out of nowhere. Feyre wonders if the wolf is a faerie in disguise. She hates faeries for all the harm they have done to humans. Feyre decides to use a precious ash arrow, a surefire method to kill a faerie, just in case. She fires the arrow as the wolf attacks the deer, killing the beast. The next evening, a golden beast bursts through the door of her family’s rundown cottage. The beast reveals that the wolf was indeed a faerie named Andras. The beast demands payment for his death under the terms of the Treaty between the human and faerie realms. The beast gives Feyre a choice: he can kill her now, or she can follow him to the faerie realm of Prythian to live out the rest of her days. Feyre chooses to live. 
In Prythian, Feyre learns the golden beast is a High Fae called Tamlin. He is the High Lord of the Spring Court. Tamlin and all the faeries in his court wear permanent masks on their faces due to an affliction called the blight. At first, Feyre is determined to escape Prythian, but she soon becomes accustomed to her new home. She learns about its history and magic and that much of what she was raised to believe about faeries, including their inability to lie and their aversion to iron, are myths. Feyre develops an affection for Alis, her lady-in-waiting, and Lucien, Tamlin’s best friend. Tamlin encourages her to explore her love for painting and to improve her reading skills. He reveals that he has ensured her family is well cared for in the human realm. Romantic and sexual tension grows between them. Although Feyre finds Prythian beautiful, it is full of dangerous creatures and intrigue. The blight makes life in Prythian increasingly perilous. After a threatening visit from a High Fae named Rhysand, Tamlin believes Feyre is no longer safe in Prythian and decides to send her back to the human realm. The night before she leaves, they make love. Tamlin tells Feyre that he loves her. Though she loves him too, she cannot bring herself to speak the words aloud.  
Feyre returns to the human realm to find that Tamlin was true to his word. Her family is extremely wealthy and well cared for. Her father and sisters have been glamoured, or tricked with faerie magic, and know nothing about faeries or how their wealth was restored. They believe Feyre has been away caring for a sick aunt. Soon, her sister Nesta reveals the glamour did not work on her. After Feyre was taken to Prythian, Nesta searched for her but was unable to cross the wall between the human and faerie realms. Nesta also reveals she is still angry at their father for not trying harder to save their mother’s life. Nesta’s words inspire Feyre to fight harder for Tamlin and she sets off for Prythian to fight the blight alongside him.  
When Feyre arrives at the Spring Court, Tamlin’s manor house is in shambles. Alis is the only one left. Alis reveals that the blight is a euphemism that refers to Amarantha, the High Queen of Prythian. Amarantha is an interloper who took Prythian over by force. She stole the powers of the High Fae and placed a curse on Tamlin that could only be broken by a woman who hated the fae declaring her love for him. Since Feyre never told Tamlin she loved him, the curse remained. The curse prevented the faeries from telling Feyre the truth, so they used the blight to explain their masks and other conflicts. Alis can tell Feyre this because Amarantha has relaxed part of the curse, believing she’s already won, but there is still one aspect of the curse Alis cannot reveal. When Alis explains that Tamlin and Lucien are Amarantha’s captives, Feyre decides to go after them. 
Feyre journeys to Amarantha’s faerie court Under the Mountain, where she becomes a captive as well. Amarantha gives her the chance to save Tamlin by completing three tasks or by solving a riddle. For the first task, Feyre uses her hunting skills to escape a giant worm in a labyrinth. As the faeries place bets and watch in amusement, the only one to bet on Feyre is Rhysand. After, he heals her broken arm. In exchange, Feyre agrees to spend a week every month with him in the Night Court. For the second task, Feyre must successfully solve a puzzle and choose the right lever or she and Lucien will be impaled and crushed. She makes the correct choice with the aid of Rhysand’s voice in her head. In the meantime, Rhysand parades Feyre around as his escort at parties. 
For the third task, Feyre must stab three faeries in the heart with ash wood daggers. Despite her guilt, she knows it’s the only way to break the curse. She stabs the first two faeries, but when the hood is removed from the third one, it is Tamlin. At first, Feyre believes she must kill the man she loves until she remembers two conversations about Tamlin’s heart of stone. She believes this means Tamlin’s heart is literally made of stone so he cannot be harmed by the dagger. Knowing Amarantha wants Tamlin for herself and doesn’t want to see him killed, Feyre plunges the dagger into Tamlin’s chest. She is correct, but Amarantha refuses to break the curse based on a technicality. In a rage, Amarantha beats Feyre almost to death.

Convertible,"The interrelated short stories in Love Medicine span half a century, with various narrators taking turns telling the stories. In 1934, Marie Lazarre, age fourteen, leaves home to live at Sacred Heart Convent, a school on a hill in town. A perverted nun, Sister Leopolda, considers Marie evil and tortures her, culminating in scalding her with boiling water and stabbing her hand with a fork. As Marie flees, she runs into a boy named Nector Kashpaw who thinks Marie has stolen from the convent. Nector, good with money, thinks he might get a reward if he catches Marie. They argue, tussle, and have sex. Marie and Nector go on to have a long marriage, many children, and many challenges. These events happen in “Saint Marie” and “Wild Geese.”
In “The Beads,” it is 1948 and nine-year-old June Morrissey comes to live with Marie and Nector Kashpaw after her mother dies in the woods. Filthy and malnourished, June thrives under Marie’s care. A child of the woods, June grows close to her Uncle Eli, a recluse, and goes to live with him.
Three stories—“Lulu’s Boys,” “The Plunge of the Brave,” and “Flesh and Blood”—are narrated in 1957, but each offers events and details from both the past and present. Lulu Lamartine’s husband, Henry, dies when a train hits his car, and Lulu has sex with Henry’s brother, Bev, resulting in the birth of their son, Henry Junior. Several years later, Bev visits Lulu to claim Henry Junior as his own, but he falls in love with Lulu despite his marriage to Elsa. 
In “The Plunge of the Brave,” Nector Kashpaw narrates his story, beginning in the 1930s. As a young man, he played in Hollywood Western films and modeled for a famous painting called The Plunge of the Brave. After marrying Marie, seventeen years go by, filled with babies, drinking, gambling, work, and tribal leadership. In 1952, Nector realizes that he still pines for Lulu, whom he loved as a teenager. He reconnects with her and they make love, leading to weekly trysts for five years. When Nector decides to leave Marie, he pens two letters. The letter to Lulu accidentally leads to burning Lulu’s house down when Nector lets a lit cigarette ignite it. On the same day, in “Flesh and Blood,” Marie discovers the letter saying that Nector is leaving her for Lulu. Marie finds the letter in her kitchen after she visits the dying Sister Leopolda. However, when Nector later returns home, Marie realizes that he is staying and hides the letter again without mentioning that she found it in the first place.
Lyman Lamartine narrates “The Red Convertible” in 1973, but the story begins in 1970 when Lyman and Henry Junior buy a red convertible and go on a road trip to Alaska. When they return, Henry Junior is drafted and ends up in a Vietnamese prison, returning with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Before he goes home, Henry Junior meets young Albertine Johnson in Fargo. They have sex, but Henry Junior gets drunk and loses his senses. He explodes, screams, and weeps as “The Bridge” ends. Back at home, Henry Junior is jumpy and mean. Lyman deliberately damages the convertible to give Henry Junior a reason to live as he hoped Henry Junior would be interested in repairing the car. However, when the brothers drive to the Red River, they drink too much, Henry Junior turns morose, and they fight. After Henry Junior jumps into the river and drowns, Lyman pushes the car into the water and watches it sink.
The next cluster of stories are narrated from 1980 to 1984. Albertine Johnson and Dot Nanapush work at a truck weighing station together in “Scales.” Gerry, Dot’s husband, escapes from prison but is arrested again. Dot gives birth to their daughter, and Gerry is sent to a maximum-security prison for shooting a state trooper. June Morrissey dies on Easter Sunday while walking in the snow after a sexual encounter. Her niece, Albertine, goes home a week after her funeral and witnesses a violent night of drinking and fighting that involves King, Lynette, Marie, Nector, Lipsha, Gordie, and baby King Junior. Gordie, who has been separated from June for some time, starts drinking heavily, feeling guilty and responsible for her death. He hallucinates visits from June, lost in a fog of alcohol-induced psychosis. When Gordie hits a deer in “Crown of Thorns,” he thinks he has hit June. He goes to the convent to confess “killing his wife” and meets Sister Mary Martin who sees the deer in the backseat of the car, not a woman. 
The final cluster of events focuses on Lipsha Morrissey who was adopted by Marie and Nector as a young child. Lipsha carries magic in him and has a healing touch. He serves as an attendant in the Senior Citizens home, now the residence of Marie, Nector, and Lulu. Lipsha walks in on Lulu and Nector having sex in the laundry room, indicating that Nector still lusts for her. Lipsha agrees to help Marie reclaim Nector’s heart with “love medicine.” When he misses shooting wild geese to use their hearts for the medicine, he buys frozen turkeys as a shortcut. However, Nector chokes and dies when he eats the turkey heart. Family and friends attend Grandpa Nector’s funeral, and Nector’s spirit visits Marie. Lipsha explains to Marie that Nector loved her and releases the man’s spirit. Despite Lulu’s affair with Nector, Marie and Lulu become friends when Marie agrees to help Lulu recover from eye surgery. 
In the final story, Lulu tells Lipsha who his biological parents are: his mother was June Morrissey and his father was Gerry Nanapush. Lipsha journeys to a border town where he joins the army and envisions that Gerry will escape prison yet again. He leaves the army and drives to see King, whom he now knows is his half-brother, and finds him with Lynette and King Junior. As the men play poker, the TV announces Gerry’s escape. Gerry soon appears because King snitched on him while they were in prison and he’s angry about it. When the police show up to arrest Gerry, he escapes. After Lipsha demands King’s car, which Lipsha won in a game of poker, he discovers his father, Gerry, in the trunk. Lipsha helps Gerry cross the border and escape the police. After, Lipsha accepts who he is and emotionally releases his parents while standing on a bridge over a river, ready to return to the reservation."
Works,"In Common Sense, Thomas Paine argues for American independence. His argument begins with more general, theoretical reflections about government and religion, then progresses onto the specifics of the colonial situation.
Paine begins by distinguishing between government and society. Society, according to Paine, is everything constructive and good that people join together to accomplish. Government, on the other hand, is an institution whose sole purpose is to protect us from our own vices. Government has its origins in the evil of man and is therefore a necessary evil at best. Paine says that government's sole purpose is to protect life, liberty and property, and that a government should be judged solely on the basis of the extent to which it accomplishes this goal.
Paine then considers an imagined scenario in which a small group of people has been placed on an island, and cut off from the rest of society. In time, these people develop ties with one another, and lawmaking becomes inevitable. Paine says the people will be much happier if they are responsible for the creation of the laws that rule them. Paine is also implicitly arguing that such a system of representation is also better for the American colonists. Having expressed his disagreement with British reign in America, Paine proceeds to launch a general attack on the British system of government. Paine says the British system is too complex and rife with contradictions, and that the monarchy is granted far too much power. The British system pretends to offer a reasonable system of checks and balances, but in fact, it does not.
From here Paine moves on to discuss, in general, the notions of monarchy and hereditary succession. Man, Pain argues, was born into a state of equality, and the distinction that has arisen between king and subject is an unnatural one. At first, Paine says, the world was without kings, but the ancient Jews decided they wanted a king. This angered God, but he allowed them to have one. Paine presents pages of biblical evidence detailing God's wrath at the idea of the Jews having a king. The conclusion Paine reaches is that the practice of monarchy originates from sin, and is an institution that the Bible and God condemn. Paine calls hereditary succession an abominable practice. He says that even if people were to choose to have a king, that does not legitimize that King's child acting as a future ruler. Furthermore, hereditary succession has brought with it innumerable evils, such as incompetent kings, corruption, and civil war.
Having dispensed with the preliminary theoretical issues, Paine sets in to discuss the details of the American situation. In response to the argument that America has flourished under British rule, and therefore ought to stay under the king, Paine says that such an argument fails to realize that America has evolved and no longer needs Britain's help. Some say that Britain has protected America, and therefore deserves allegiance, but Paine responds that Britain has only watched over America in order to secure its own economic well-being. Paine adds that most recently, instead of watching over the colonies, the British have been attacking them, and are therefore undeserving of American loyalty.
Paine says that the colonies have little to gain from remaining attached to Britain. Commerce can be better conducted with the rest of Europe, but only after America becomes independent. Paine also asserts that if the colonies remain attached to Britain, the same problems that have arisen in the past will arise in the future. Paine argues that it is necessary to seek independence now, as to do otherwise would only briefly cover up problems that will surely reemerge.
Paine even proposes the form of government that the independent colonies should adopt. His recommendation is for a representative democracy that gives roughly equal weight to each of the colonies.
Paine explains why the current time is a good time to break free of Britain. Primarily, Paine focuses on the present size of the colonies, and on their current capabilities. He presents an inventory of the British Navy and gives calculations revealing how America could build a navy of comparable size. Paine recommends this as a way of ensuring America's security and prosperity in trade. Paine also argues that America is sufficiently small as to be united now. If time were to elapse, and the population of the colonies to grow, the same feeling of unity would not be present. Paine adds that if the Americans revolt now, they can use the vast expanses of uncharted land to the West in order to pay down some of the debt they will incur.
Paine says that as a colony of Britain, America lacks respectability on the international scene. They are seen simply as rebels, and cannot form substantial alliances with other nations. In order to prosper in the long term, the colonies need to be independent. Paine says that, by declaring independence, America will be able to ask for the help of other countries in its struggle for freedom. For all of these reasons, Paine says it is imperative and urgent that the colonies declare independence."
Island,"The narrator, Edward Prendick, explains that he intends to recount the strange and horrible tale of the year he was lost at sea and presumed dead. His tale begins with the shipwreck of the Lady Vain off the coast of South America. Prendick and two other passengers board a dingy and float at sea for days without food or water. Growing desperate, the three men entertain thoughts of cannibalism. Prendick’s companions fight each other, and both fall overboard to their deaths, leaving Prendick alone on the dingey. Seemingly doomed and growing delirious, Prendick is scooped up and rescued by a passing schooner.  
Prendick regains consciousness several days later in the cabin of Montgomery, a passenger who has been caring for him. Prendick also encounters Montgomery’s attendant M’ling, a timid man with a dark complexion and a strangely proportioned body who arouses an inexplicable sense of revulsion in Prendick and others. The schooner is carrying a bizarre cargo of animals, including rabbits, staghounds, llamas, and a puma. The animals, which belong to Montgomery, are being ferried to the island where Montgomery and M’ling live. The ship’s captain, a raving drunkard, despises Montgomery, the animals, and above all M’ling, whom he and the rest of the crew consider a freak. Prendick also becomes a target of the captain’s rage when he attempts to defend Montgomery and M’ling.   
When the ship reaches the island, Montgomery disembarks with his animal cargo. The captain refuses to allow Prendick to stay on the ship, and Montgomery eventually agrees to let Prendick accompany him to the island. There, Prendick meets some of Montgomery’s men and notices that they have strange, unnaturally proportioned bodies and a bizarre skin tone. Montgomery introduces Prendick to Dr. Moreau, a white-haired man who explains that the island is a biological research station. Prendick recognizes Moreau’s name and recalls that, years ago, a  scientist by that name had been hounded out of England for his gruesome experiments on animals. Prendick’s misgivings are later confirmed when he overhears the tortured cries of an animal, which he assumes to be the puma, apparently being vivisected in the room next to his. Disturbed by the puma’s cries, Prendick flees out of the compound and into the jungle.  
In the jungle, Prendick encounters a strange man walking on four legs and lapping water from a stream like an animal. He tries to return to the compound, but the strange man stalks him. Fearing for his life, Prendick fashions an improvised sling and knocks the man unconscious. Back at the compound, he again hears tortured cries in the next room and suspects that Moreau is vivisecting a human. Barging through the door, he discovers Moreau vivisecting a creature bound to a rack. Fearing that Moreau plans to vivisect him next, Prendick flees again into the jungle. There, he meets a friendly Ape-man who offers him to food. The Ape-man takes Prendick to a cavern, where he lives with several other creatures who seem to be part human, part animal. Their leader, who introduces himself as the Sayer of the Law, leads these “Beast Folk” in the recital of “the Law,” a series of quasi-religious prohibitions of animal-like behaviors such as walking on all fours, eating flesh, and chasing other “men.” These rites seem designed to remind the animals to behave like “men” rather than animals, lest they be punished and subjected to great pain by Moreau, whom they revere as a sort of fearful deity.   
Montgomery and Moreau arrive at the cavern and order the creatures to capture Prendick. Prendick flees through the jungle and runs into the sea, determined to commit suicide rather than become Moreau’s next victim. But Moreau convinces Prendick that he means him no harm. Back at the compound, Moreau explains that he is researching “the plasticity of living forms.” His experiments aim to transform an animal into a human by vivisecting it, reconfiguring its body parts, combining it with parts from other animals, altering its body chemistry, and implanting certain ideas into its mind. So far, he has only succeeded in creating Beast Folk with some human qualities and abilities, but they all succumb to their animal instincts in ways that disappoint and frustrate Moreau. The Beast Folk on the island are all Moreau’s experimental creations, whom he casts away whenever he finds them insufficiently human.  
Later, in the jungle, Prendick and Montgomery discover the mutilated corpse of a rabbit and realize that some of the Beast Folk are deviating from the Law. Moreau decides to find and punish the perpetrator as an example. He summons all the Beast Folk and accuses the Leopard-man of breaking the Law. The Leopard-man attacks Moreau and then runs off into the jungle. The Beast Folk and humans give chase, eventually cornering the Leopard-man. But in a moment of sympathy, Prendick shoots the Leopard-man rather than allowing him to be captured and tortured by Moreau.  
The men uneasily return to the compound. A few weeks later, the puma breaks free from its restraints and bolts away. Moreau pursues the puma but fails to return. Montgomery goes out to find him and discovers that the Beast Folk have gone wild and killed Moreau. Drunk and despairing, Montgomery goes to the beach, where he  too is murdered, leaving Prendick the lone human on the island.  
Prendick survives for ten more months on the island by asserting authority over the Beast Folk. He forms an alliance with the Dog-man, who seems predisposed to serve him, and fends off challenges from others by brandishing weapons and issuing empty threats that prove effective on the simple-minded Beast Folk. Still, he lives in constant fear of the Hyena-swine, who refuses to serve him.  
As time passes, Prendick notices that all the Beast Folk are gradually regressing, losing their human features and abilities. One day, a small boat washes ashore. Prendick fills it with supplies and departs from the island. After several days, he is picked up by a ship. He tells no one his tale, fearing that he will be thought insane. He returns to England, where he is haunted by his memories of the island. Unable to assimilate back into civilized society, he retires to the countryside and seeks solace in the solitary study of astronomy."
Viewed,"Lucy Honeychurch, a young upper middle class woman, visits Italy under the charge of her older cousin Charlotte. At their pension, or guesthouse, in Florence, they are given rooms that look into the courtyard rather than out over the river Arno. Mr. Emerson, a fellow guest, generously offers them the rooms belonging to himself and his son George. Although Charlotte is offended by Mr. Emerson's lack of tact and propriety, she finally does agree to the switch. Lucy is an avid young pianist. Mr. Beebe, watches her passionate playing and predicts that someday she will live her life with as much gusto as she plays the piano.
Lucy's visit to Italy is marked by several significant encounters with the Emersons. In Santa Croce church, George complains that his father means well, but always offends everyone. Mr. Emerson tells Lucy that his son needs her in order to overcome his youthful melancholy. Later, Lucy is walking in the Piazza Signoria, feeling dull, when she comes in close contact with two quarreling Italian men. One man stabs the other, and she faints, to be rescued by George. On their return trip home, he kisses her, much to her surprise. She keeps his rash behavior a secret.
On a country outing in the hills, Lucy wanders in search of Mr. Beebe and the supercilious chaplain, Mr. Eager. However, the Italian cab driver leads her instead to George, who is standing on a terrace covered with blue violets. George sees her and again kisses her, but this time Charlotte sees him and chastises him after they have resurnedreturned to the pension. She leaves with Lucy for Rome the next day.
The second half of the book centers on Lucy's home in Surrey, where she lives with her mother, Mrs. Honeychurch, and her brother, Freddy. A man she met in Rome, the snobbish Cecil Vyse, proposes marriage to her for the third time, and she accepts him. He disapproves of her family and the country people she knows, finding them coarse and unsophisticated. There is a small, ugly villa available for rent in the town, and as a joke, Cecil offers it to the Emersons, whom he meets by chance in a museum. They take him up on the offer and move in, much to Lucy's initial horror.
George plays tennis with the Honeychurches on a Sunday when Cecil is at his most intolerable. After the game, Cecil reads from a book by Miss Lavish, a woman who also stayed with Lucy and Charlotte at the pension in Florence. The novel records a kiss among violets, and Lucy realizes that Charlotte let the secret out. In a moment alone, George kisses her again. Lucy tells him to leave, but George insists that Cecil is not the right man for her, characterizing Cecil as controlling and appreciative of things rather than people. Lucy sees Cecil in a new light, and breaks off her engagement that night.
However, Lucy will not believe that she loves George; she wants to stay unmarried and travel to Greece with some elderly women she met in Italy, the Miss Alans. She meets old Mr. Emerson by chance, who insists that she loves George and should marry him, because it is what her soul truly wants. Lucy realizes he is right, and though she must fly against convention, she marries George, and the book ends with the happy couple staying together in the Florence pension again, in a room with a view.
Analysis
The book depicts Lucy's struggles as she emerges as her own woman, growing from indecision to fulfillment. She struggles between strict, old-fashioned Victorian values and newer, more liberal mores. In this struggle Lucy's own idea of what is true evolves and matures. Her trip to Italy opens her sheltered eyes to ideas and people unlike those she has known growing up in the English countryside. She also notices how freely Italian classes seem to mix, and realizes that the social boundaries she has always regarded as fixed are actually arbitrary. Her experience with the Emersons shows her that there can be beauty in the things that are considered improper, and Charlotte's betrayal shows her that propriety is not always the best judge of what is true.
Having more clearly found herself in Italy, Lucy's real test lies at home, where she must confront her old familiar surroundings. She is still uncertain, however, and confused about what to think about her new experiences. That she missteps and becomes engaged to the pretentious and domineering Cecil shows her susceptibility to the pressures of society. As her bold piano playing suggests, she is cut out for a more daring life, if only she could cut herself away from the restricting social boundaries that engulf her. The Emersons, as free-thinking, modern, truth-loving people, are her deliverers from the grips of society. It is this freedom that allows her to see beyond the dictates of propriety that forbid her marriage to the lower-class George and, therefore, to follow her heart.
George is troubled by existential worries in Italy. He doesn't understand how life can be truly joyful and worthwhile when it is always shadowed by enigma, symbolized by the question mark that he hangs on the wall of his hotel. Lucy, though cautious, is loving by nature and enjoys life even when it challenges her understanding. The two are united by a shared appreciation for beauty, which might be captured in their love of views: Lucy adores the view of the Arno through the pension window, while George's first memory is of himself and his parents gazing at a view. Each possesses what the other needs: George finds simple joys staying with the Honeychurch family, while Lucy finds the courage to recognize her own individuality through her contact with the Emersons.

A Room with a View is one of Forster's early works, and is not as complex as the more mature Howard's End and Passage to India. However, its strength lies in its vivid cast of characters, humorous dialogue, and comedic play upon the manners of the day, and in Forster's engaging, sympathetic exploration of Lucy's character."
Reconciled,"The convict Jean Valjean is released from a French prison after serving nineteen years for stealing a loaf of bread and for subsequent attempts to escape from prison. When Valjean arrives at the town of Digne, no one is willing to give him shelter because he is an ex-convict. Desperate, Valjean knocks on the door of M. Myriel, the kindly bishop of Digne. Myriel treats Valjean with kindness, and Valjean repays the bishop by stealing his silverware. When the police arrest Valjean, Myriel covers for him, claiming that the silverware was a gift. The authorities release Valjean and Myriel makes him promise to become an honest man. Eager to fulfill his promise, Valjean masks his identity and enters the town of Montreuil-sur-mer. Under the assumed name of Madeleine, Valjean invents an ingenious manufacturing process that brings the town prosperity. He eventually becomes the town’s mayor.
Fantine, a young woman from Montreuil, lives in Paris. She falls in love with Tholomyès, a wealthy student who gets her pregnant and then abandons her. Fantine returns to her home village with her daughter, Cosette. On the way to Montreuil, however, Fantine realizes that she will never be able to find work if the townspeople know that she has an illegitimate child. In the town of Montfermeil, she meets the Thénardiers, a family that runs the local inn. The Thénardiers agree to look after Cosette as long as Fantine sends them a monthly allowance.
In Montreuil, Fantine finds work in Madeleine’s factory. Fantine’s coworkers find out about Cosette, however, and Fantine is fired. The Thénardiers demand more money to support Cosette, and Fantine resorts to prostitution to make ends meet. One night, Javert, Montreuil’s police chief, arrests Fantine. She is to be sent to prison, but Madeleine intervenes. Fantine has fallen ill, and when she longs to see Cosette, Madeleine promises to send for her. First, however, he must contend with Javert, who has discovered Madeleine’s criminal past. Javert tells Madeleine that a man has been accused of being Jean Valjean, and Madeleine confesses his true identity. Javert shows up to arrest Valjean while Valjean is at Fantine’s bedside, and Fantine dies from the shock.
After a few years, Valjean escapes from prison and heads to Montfermeil, where he is able to buy Cosette from the Thénardiers. The Thénardiers turn out to be a family of scoundrels who abuse Cosette while spoiling their own two daughters, Eponine and Azelma. Valjean and Cosette move to a run-down part of Paris. Javert discovers their hideout, however, and they are forced to flee. They find refuge in a convent, where Cosette attends school and Valjean works as a gardener.
Marius Pontmercy is a young man who lives with his wealthy grandfather, M. Gillenormand. Because of political differences within the family, Marius has never met his father, Georges Pontmercy. After his father dies, however, Marius learns more about him and comes to admire his father’s democratic politics. Angry with his grandfather, Marius moves out of Gillenormand’s house and lives as a poor young law student. While in law school, Marius associates with a group of radical students, the Friends of the ABC, who are led by the charismatic Enjolras. One day, Marius sees Cosette at a public park. It is love at first sight, but the protective Valjean does his utmost to prevent Cosette and Marius from ever meeting. Their paths cross once again, however, when Valjean makes a charitable visit to Marius’s poor neighbors, the Jondrettes. The Jondrettes are in fact the Thénardiers, who have lost their inn and moved to Paris under an assumed name. After Valjean leaves, Thénardier announces a plan to rob Valjean when he returns. Alarmed, Marius alerts the local police inspector, who turns out to be Javert. The ambush is foiled and the Thénardiers are arrested, but Valjean escapes before Javert can identify him.
Thénardier’s daughter Eponine, who is in love with Marius, helps Marius discover Cosette’s whereabouts. Marius is finally able to make contact with Cosette, and the two declare their love for each other. Valjean, however, soon shatters their happiness. Worried that he will lose Cosette and unnerved by political unrest in the city, Valjean announces that he and Cosette are moving to England. In desperation, Marius runs to his grandfather, M. Gillenormand, to ask for M. Gillenormand’s permission to marry Cosette. Their meeting ends in a bitter argument. When Marius returns to Cosette, she and Valjean have disappeared. Heartbroken, Marius decides to join his radical student friends, who have started a political uprising. Armed with two pistols, Marius heads for the barricades.
The uprising seems doomed, but Marius and his fellow students nonetheless stand their ground and vow to fight for freedom and democracy. The students discover Javert among their ranks, and, realizing that he is a spy, Enjolras ties him up. As the army launches its first attack against the students, Eponine throws herself in front of a rifle to save Marius’s life. As Eponine dies in Marius’s arms, she hands him a letter from Cosette. Marius quickly scribbles a reply and orders a boy, Gavroche, to deliver it to Cosette.
Valjean manages to intercept the note and sets out to save the life of the man his daughter loves. Valjean arrives at the barricade and volunteers to execute Javert. When alone with Javert, however, Valjean instead secretly lets him go free. As the army storms the barricade, Valjean grabs the wounded Marius and flees through the sewers. When Valjean emerges hours later, Javert immediately arrests him. Valjean pleads with Javert to let him take the dying Marius to Marius’s grandfather. Javert agrees. Javert feels tormented, torn between his duty to his profession and the debt he owes Valjean for saving his life. Ultimately, Javert lets Valjean go and throws himself into the river, where he drowns.
Marius makes a full recovery and is reconciled with Gillenormand, who consents to Marius and Cosette’s marriage. Their wedding is a happy one, marred only when Valjean confesses his criminal past to Marius. Alarmed by this revelation and unaware that it was Valjean who saved his life at the barricades, Marius tries to prevent Cosette from having contact with Valjean. Lonely and depressed, Valjean takes to his bed and awaits his death. Marius eventually finds out from Thénardier that Valjean saved Marius’s life. Ashamed that he mistrusted Valjean, Marius tells Cosette everything that has happened. Marius and Cosette rush to Valjean’s side just in time for a final reconciliation. Happy to be reunited with his adopted daughter, Valjean dies in peace."
Lowest,"In 1998, Barbara Ehrenreich, a journalist and activist then in her late 50s, sets out to document the daily struggles of America’s working poor. Having trained as a biologist, she decides to do fieldwork: in three different U.S. cities, she takes minimum-wage jobs and looks for affordable places to live. She leaves her Ph.D. and most of her skills off of her applications, to ensure that she is given the lowest-level positions available to a white, native-English speaking woman. However, she will use outside cash, if necessary, to ensure that she will never be without a car, she will not have to skip meals to save money, and she will never be homeless.
Ehrenreich’s first experiences are in Key West, Florida. Her most affordable living option, cheaper than a trailer in town, is a shabby efficiency apartment thirty miles away. Although she expects to earn $7 per hour, the first job she lands, as a diner waitress, pays much less, because she will also earn tips. The job requires not only serving tables but also additional work, like cleaning and restocking. Although Ehrenreich gets along well with her coworkers, she struggles as a waitress, because of her lack of experience. Realizing that she will not be able to stay in her apartment on what she is earning, she tries takes a second waitressing job, at another diner. She quickly realizes she will be physically unable to work both jobs, quits the first job, and takes a hotel housekeeping job next door to the second diner, instead. However, when her supervisor at the second diner yells at her, Ehrenreich has had enough and walks out.
Ehrenreich’s next location is Portland, Maine. There, after much searching, she finds a small apartment she will be able to afford. She takes two jobs. The first is with a maid service that cleans the homes of affluent clients where she works on a cleaning team with several other women. The work is back-breaking, and Ehrenreich develops a skin rash of unknown origin. She sees the other women continue to work even when they are injured or feeling sick. She notices that the cleaning techniques the team is taught to use are more about making homes look cleaner than about actually cleaning them. She learns that her employer charges customers $25 per person-hour, while she will earn $6.65 an hour. Ehrenreich’s other job is at a nursing home, where she helps serve food to residents with Alzheimer’s. The interactions with the residents are pleasant, but the cleanup work after meals is overwhelming, partly because one of the automatic dishwashers is broken.
In Minneapolis, Minnesota, finally, Ehrenreich has a very hard time finding safe, sanitary housing she can afford. A charity worker suggests that she check into a shelter while saving up first month’s rent. She has two job applications accepted, but backs out of one job, at a hardware store, when her very first shift is scheduled to last eleven hours without overtime pay. The other job is in women’s clothing at Wal-Mart. The day-long orientation for new employees includes criticism of labor unions, while the pay is less than typical for the area. The store layout is constantly changing, and customers make extra work for her by leaving unbought merchandise in other departments. The job makes Ehrenreich, by her own account, callous and spiteful. Meanwhile, she has been unable to secure a long-term rental situation. Fed up, at one of the employee meetings she starts talking about the need for a union. By now, she has already decided to quit.
Reviewing her experiences in light of the data from many different studies, Ehrenreich comes to several conclusions. She finds that workers cannot support themselves on minimum wage in America unless they work multiple jobs, and only so long as there are no unexpected expenses, such as for medical care. Ehrenreich also finds that employers try to keep information about the wages they pay from becoming general knowledge among workers. Additionally, she finds that the ways in which workers are supervised, including random urine tests for drug use, encourage the workers to accept being dehumanized. Ehrenreich adds that the attitudes found in managers of low-wage employees are based on class or racial prejudice. Finally, she states that medical benefits and child care are too expensive even for middle-class workers, let alone ones on minimum wage. She notes that perhaps someday the working poor will refuse to stop accepting their situation and will demand that things change—and concludes that the country will be a better place when they do."
Heaven,"Pigs In Heaven opens in rural Kentucky, where Alice Greer has woken up in the middle of the night, feeling lonely. She walks outside in her nightgown, imagining herself the queen of her own humble garden. Her husband Harland and his fetish with their T.V. provides her little warmth. She thinks about her cousin, Sugar, her girlhood companion. Although now Sugar lives out in Oklahoma, on the Cherokee Nation, the thought of her makes Alice feel less alone.
Meanwhile, Alice's daughter Taylor and Taylor's adopted daughter Turtle are visiting the Hoover Dam, one of their stopping points on their tour of the Grand Canyon. When Turtle sees a man—Lucky Buster—fall off the edge of the dam, Taylor and Turtle hound down a rescue team, and are immediately catapulted into the media spotlight. After driving Lucky Buster home, they return home to Tucson, only to prepare for a trip to Chicago to appear on Oprah.
When Taylor and Turtle return home again, it seems as if their lives have almost returned to normal. They live with Jax, Taylor's boyfriend, on the outskirts of Tucson, in a community of humble stone dwellings inhabited mostly by artists and a few academics. Jax adores Taylor, but Taylor is not as sure about him. Before Taylor and Turtle can settle in again, however, Annawake Fourkiller, a lawyer from the Cherokee Nation, shows up at their home to confront Taylor about Turtle's adoption. Annawake saw Turtle on Oprah, and recognized her as a Cherokee girl. On the show, Taylor explained the peculiar circumstances of the adoption: a woman in a bar in Oklahoma handed the baby over to Taylor. The Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 states that no one can adopt a Cherokee child without tribal permission.
Taylor is understandably enraged. She never asked for a child, and when Turtle came to her, she was half-dead, having been sexually abused. Three years later, Turtle is a happy, healthy, secure child, and all of a sudden, Annawake shows up telling Taylor that Turtle cannot belong to her. The next time Annawake comes to their home, Taylor and Turtle have fled.
Turtle and Taylor are staying at Lucky Buster's mother's hotel in Arizona, but when Taylor hears that Annawake is still on the scene, they flee to Las Vegas. At this point in the novel, Turtle begins to have bad memories of her abusive past, which cause her to disengage with the world around her. Any threat of separation, or fear of dislocation, seems to incite these episodes.
Taylor and Turtle arrive in Las Vegas, and immediately gamble away what little money they had. At that point, Alice comes to meet her daughter and granddaughter, to offer support, and to run away for good from her husband. They meet a waitress who has a nutty obsession with Barbie, and feeling sorry for her, give her a ride when they leave Las Vegas. At this point, Taylor has no idea where to go next, but only knows that she is still running from Annawake.
Meanwhile, in a tourist town in Wyoming, Cash Stillwater cannot seem to move beyond his tragic past. He has come to live there from the Cherokee Nation, having lost his mother, wife, and one of his daughters all in the same year. The daughter who died by suicide had a child, who a second daughter gave away one night at a bar in Oklahoma. Cash works in a health food store and makes beaded jewelry by night, but feels empty. When the owner of the jewelry store commits suicide, Cash decides he has to return home to the Cherokee Nation.
At home in Tucson, Jax receives a letter from Annawake the same night he begins an affair with his landlord, Gundi. The letter is one way that we come to sympathize with Annawake's position. She lost her twin brother, Gabe to a white family in Texas when they were only ten. The Cherokee tribe has suffered an inordinate amount at the hands of white Americans throughout history; now, white America is still taking children from the Nation. Also, Annawake explains that this pursuance is also for Turtle's benefit. Native American children who grow up outside the nation without a sense of their heritage, usually suffer greatly.
When Jax reads the letter to Taylor over the phone, she becomes more desperate, but Alice understands that at some point, they will have to talk to Annawake about this problem. Alice calls up her cousin Sugar and makes plans to go to the Cherokee Nation to talk over Turtle's case. Taylor, Turtle, and Barbie go on to Seattle, where they find a room to rent. Taylor has discovered that Barbie has stolen money from the Las Vegas casino, but condones her behavior. Taylor finds low-wage work in Seattle, and Barbie baby-sits for Turtle, until one night they find that Barbie has fled with all of Taylor's money. Feeling desperate, Taylor calls Jax, forgiving him for his affair, and finally figures she will go home. Unfortunately, Alice tells her on the phone from Oklahoma that Taylor has to come out to the Nation; Annawake is going to send her a subpoena.
Meanwhile, on the Nation, Cash Stillwater has returned, and he and Alice have started to date. Alice goes with him to a stomp dance, and finally feels completely part of a community. Alice has also met with Annawake, of course, who reports that there is a relative on the Nation missing a little girl, who might be Turtle. Alice and Cash figure out that they are both in the midst of trying to protect the same grandchild—Turtle. Annawake has actually orchestrated their romantic involvement, hoping some answer would come out of it.
When Taylor arrives, Turtle recognizes Cash right away, and he breaks down in cries of happiness. Both sides still do not want to give up Turtle. In a meeting with members of the Cherokee community, Annawake announces that through talks with the tribe social worker, they have decided to give joint custody to Cash and Taylor. Turtle will spend at least three months of the year on the Nation. Cash then asks Alice to marry him, suggesting that Turtle would be able to visit her grandmother as well as her grandfather during those months. In a symbolic sacrifice to Alice, he destroys his T.V. in front of the whole community."
Naught,"Cold Mountain opens with its protagonist, Inman, lying in a Virginia hospital recovering from war wounds. He is shattered by the violence he has witnessed while fighting in the Confederate army and wants to go home to reunite with Ada, the woman he loves. Inman talks to a blind man and realizes that losing something you already have is worse than not getting what you want. One day in town, Inman writes to inform Ada that he is returning home. That night, he leaves the hospital through a window and sets out on his journey back to North Carolina. 
The story of Inman’s adventures intertwines with Ada’s story. Ada is left alone to manage Black Cove Farm following her father’s death. She is bereft and has no idea where she belongs or how she should earn a living. When she visits the Swangers, her neighbors, Ada looks into a well to foretell her future. She sees a man walking through the woods on a journey but does not know what this vision means. The next day, Sally Swanger sends a local girl named Ruby to help out on the farm. Ruby and Ada become friends and establish a comfortable domestic routine.
	Meanwhile, Inman’s journey westward is fraught with danger and violence. He is pursued across the Cape Fear River, escaping with his life thanks to the skill of a girl paddling a dugout canoe. Inman intervenes when he finds a dissolute preacher, Solomon Veasey, attempting to murder his (the preacher’s) pregnant lover. The preacher is exiled from his community, and Inman is forced to -continue part of his journey with Veasey. Inman has to intervene again when Veasey causes trouble in a store and at an inn. While Veasey spends the night with a prostitute called Big Tildy, the peddler Odell tells Inman a sad story about landowners’ cruelty towards slaves. 
The next day, Inman and Veasey help a man remove a dead bull from his stream. This man, Junior, invites them to his home to spend the night, and several strange things happen. Inman is drugged and forced to marry Junior’s wife, who the author suggests may be a cannibal. Junior then hands Inman and Veasey over to the Home Guard, the military force that has been searching for Inman. Inman is forced to walk eastward, retracing his steps. The guards decide to shoot the men and bury them in a shallow grave. Although Inman escapes with a slight head wound, Veasey dies.
	Ada’s story resumes. The novel follows her adjustment to a life of labor in harmony with nature. Ada’s friendship with Ruby blossoms as she begins to identify with the natural world. The female protagonist lays down roots at the farm and recalls memories of Inman and her father. Occasionally, she finds herself touched by events surrounding the war. A group of pilgrims forced into exile by Federal soldiers seeks shelter for a day at the farm. Ada recalls Blount, a soldier she met at a party in Charleston who later died in battle. 
Finally, when Ada and Ruby visit the town of Cold Mountain, they hear a story told by a prisoner jailed for desertion. The captive tells of the sadistic Teague’s band of the Home Guard. On their walk home, the two women observe some herons, and Ruby explains that a heron fathered her. Ada tells the intricate story of her parents’ relationship and her mother’s tragic death in childbirth. Ruby’s father, Stobrod, appears later, caught in a trap the women have laid to catch a corn thief. He explains that he is living in a mountain cave with a community of outliers who object to the war. Stobrod plays his fiddle to prove that he is a changed man, but Ruby remains skeptical.
	Inman’s story continues. Having been dragged from the shallow grave by wild hogs, Inman meets a kind slave who feeds and clothes him and draws a map of what lies ahead. He returns to Junior’s house and kills him. Inman then continues on his journey, full of despair, a “traveling shade.” Inman meets an old woman who offers him shelter at her camp in the mountains. He rests and regains his strength while the woman nurses his wounds and talks about her life. Inman learns that the woman ran away from a loveless marriage and raises goats for company and sustenance. Inman identifies with the goat-woman, but concludes that he could not live such an isolated life. 
Inman continues to wander and meets a man called “Potts,” who directs him to a cabin belonging to Sara, a kind young woman whose husband died in battle. Sara feeds Inman, mends his clothes and tells him her story. Despite her bravery, she is close to despair. The next day, Inman kills three Federal soldiers, called “Federals” in the novel,  after these men threaten Sara and her baby and steal the family hog, the only form of sustenance that the family has.
	At home, Ada and Ruby start harvesting apples as autumn nears. Stobrod reappears with a slow-witted banjo player named Pangle. Ruby’s father asks for shelter at the farm and for food provisions, explaining that the men intend to leave the outliers’ cave because it is getting too dangerous. To Ruby’s annoyance, Ada agrees to help Stobrod. The men go off into the mountains with a boy from Georgia to find their own camp. Teague’s Home Guard appears looking for the mountain cave and shoots Stobrod and Pangle. The Georgia boy, who survived because he hid in a thicket, runs to the farm and tells the women what happened. Ada and Ruby leave to bury the bodies and camp out in the mountains. The next day, they bury Pangle but discover that Stobrod is still alive. Ruby removes the bullet from her father and takes him to an abandoned Cherokee village.
	Meanwhile, Inman reaches Black Cove Farm and finds himself in sight of Cold Mountain. The Georgia boy tells him that the women have left to bury Ruby’s father. Inman climbs the mountain and finds Pangle’s grave but loses Ada’s tracks in the snow. The next day he hears a gunshot and finds Ada hunting turkeys. The lovers spend four days together at the Cherokee village, discussing their feelings, past experiences, and plans for the future. They decide that Inman will walk north and surrender to the Federals, since the war will be over soon. On the fifth day, Stobrod is strong enough to travel. Ada and Ruby leave for the farm and the men follow.
	On the journey back to Black Cove, the Home Guard ambushes Inman and Stobrod. Inman kills all the men except for Birch, Teague’s second-in-command. Birch seems powerless and scared, but he shoots Inman before the Inman can attack him. Ada hears the shots, finds Stobrod, and races back to locate Inman. She holds him in her lap as he dies.
	In a brief epilogue set ten years later, Ada, her nine year-old daughter (presumably by Inman), and Ruby’s family gather in the evening. Ruby has married the boy from Georgia, called Reid, and has had three sons with him. The family sits down to eat. When the meal is over, Stobrod plays his fiddle and Ada reads to the children."
Invited,"Eight people, all strangers to each other, are invited to Indian Island, off the English coast. Vera Claythorne, a former governess, thinks she has been hired as a secretary; Philip Lombard, an adventurer, and William Blore, an ex-detective, think they have been hired to look out for trouble over the weekend; Dr. Armstrong thinks he has been hired to look after the wife of the island’s owner. Emily Brent, General Macarthur, Tony Marston, and Judge Wargrave think they are going to visit old friends.
	When they arrive on the island, the guests are greeted by Mr. and Mrs. Rogers, the butler and housekeeper, who report that the host, someone they call Mr. Owen, will not arrive until the next day. That evening, as all the guests gather in the drawing room after an excellent dinner, they hear a recorded voice accusing each of them of a specific murder committed in the past and never uncovered. They compare notes and realize that none of them, including the servants, knows “Mr. Owen,” which suggests that they were brought here according to someone’s strange plan.
	As they discuss what to do, Tony Marston chokes on poisoned whiskey and dies. Frightened, the party retreats to bed, where almost everyone is plagued by guilt and memories of their crimes. Vera Claythorne notices the similarity between the death of Marston and the first verse of a nursery rhyme, “Ten Little Indians,” that hangs in each bedroom. 
	The next morning the guests find that Mrs. Rogers apparently died in her sleep. The guests hope to leave that morning, but the boat that regularly delivers supplies to the island does not show up. Blore, Lombard, and Armstrong decide that the deaths must have been murders and determine to scour the island in search of the mysterious Mr. Owen. They find no one, however. Meanwhile, the oldest guest, General Macarthur, feels sure he is going to die and goes to look out at the ocean. Before lunch, Dr. Armstrong finds the general dead of a blow to the head.
	The remaining guests meet to discuss their situation. They decide that one of them must be the killer. Many make vague accusations, but Judge Wargrave reminds them that the existing evidence suggests any of them could be the killer. Afternoon and dinner pass restlessly, and everyone goes to bed, locking his or her door before doing so. The next morning, they find that Rogers has been killed while chopping wood in preparation for breakfast. At this point, the guests feel sure the murders are being carried out according to the dictates of the nursery rhyme. Also, they realize that the dining-room table initially featured ten Indian figures, but with each death one of the figures disappears.
	After breakfast, Emily Brent feels slightly giddy, and she remains alone at the table for a while. She is soon found dead, her neck having been injected with poison. At this point, Wargrave initiates an organized search of everyone’s belongings, and anything that could be used as a weapon is locked away. The remaining guests sit together, passing time and casting suspicious looks at each other. Finally, Vera goes to take a bath, but she is startled by a piece of seaweed hanging from her ceiling and cries out. Blore, Lombard, and Armstrong run to help her, only to return downstairs to find Wargrave draped in a curtain that resembles courtroom robes and bearing a red mark on his forehead. Armstrong examines the body and reports that Wargrave has been shot in the head.
	That night, Blore hears footsteps in the hall; upon checking, he finds that Armstrong is not in his room. Blore and Lombard search for Armstrong, but they cannot find him anywhere in the house or on the island. When they return from searching, they discover another Indian figure missing from the table.
	Vera, Lombard, and Blore go outside, resolving to stay in the safety of the open land. Blore decides to go back into the house to get food. The other two hear a crash, and they find someone has pushed a statue out of a second-story window, killing Blore as he approached the house. Vera and Lombard retreat to the shore, where they find Armstrong’s drowned body on the beach. Convinced that Lombard is the killer, Vera steals Lombard’s gun and shoots him. She returns to her bedroom to rest, happy to have survived. But upon finding a noose waiting for her in her room, she feels a strange compulsion to enact the last line of the nursery rhyme, and hangs herself.
	The mystery baffles the police until a manuscript in a bottle is found. The late Judge Wargrave wrote the manuscript explaining that he planned the murders because he wanted to punish those whose crimes are not punishable under law. Wargrave frankly admits to his own lust for blood and pleasure in seeing the guilty punished. When a doctor told Wargrave he was dying, he decided to die in a blaze, instead of letting his life trickle away. He discusses how he chose his victims and how he did away with Marston, Mr. and Mrs. Rogers, Macarthur, and Emily Brent. Wargrave then describes how he tricked Dr. Armstrong into helping him fake his own death, promising to meet the doctor by the cliffs to discuss a plan. When Armstrong arrived, Wargrave pushed him over the edge into the sea, then returned to the house and pretended to be dead. His ruse enabled him to dispose of the rest of the guests without drawing their suspicion. Once Vera hanged herself on a noose that he prepared for her, Wargrave planned to shoot himself in such a way that his body would fall onto the bed as if it had been laid there. Thus, he hoped, the police would find ten dead bodies on an empty island."
Thomas,"Thomas wakes up in a swaying elevator, and the only thing he can remember is his first name. The elevator, called the Box, opens up, and a group of boys lower a rope for Thomas and pull him out. The boys live in a place called the Glade, a courtyard which is surrounded by an enormous labyrinth of 100-foot stone walls called the Maze. Alby, a dark-skinned boy who has been there the longest, is the leader, and his sidekick is a blond boy named Newt. For the past two years, a new boy has appeared in the Box every month. Thomas, confused and upset, demands an explanation about where he is and what’s going on, but when screams sound from a nearby building, the boys leave him with the young, pudgy Chuck, who will become like a brother to Thomas.
The screams are from a boy named Ben; he was stung by a Griever, one of the monsters that lives in the Maze. After receiving an antidote called Grief Serum, Ben is going through “the Changing,” a painful process during which the victim is flooded with memories of his life before the Maze. Gally, a bully who went through the Changing and recovered, confronts Thomas, saying that he saw Thomas during his Changing and doesn’t trust him.
Before dark, four boy run out through four “Doors” in the walls of the Maze, the walls sliding closed behind them. Chuck tells Thomas that these are the Maze Runners, and Thomas feels drawn to become one. The Runners are trying to find a way out of the Maze, and each night, in a concrete room, they map out the eight sections of the Maze. But the internal walls shift every night, creating multiple variations of the Maze, and, so far, they haven’t been able to identify an escape route. 
Before dawn the next morning, Newt shows Thomas a Griever through a window in one of the walls. It’s a “horrifying mix of animal and machine,” an enormous monster with metal arms that are capped with saws and shears. Grievers patrol the Maze at night, stinging any boy unlucky enough to be there. Alby explains that the Glade is divided into four areas: the Gardens, where they grow food, the Blood House, where they raise and butcher animals, the Homestead, where they live, and the Deadheads forest, which serves as a graveyard.
An alarm blares out through the Glade, and, for the first time ever, a girl arrives in the Box. She babbles incoherently and then falls into a coma, holding a note reading that reads, “She’s the last one. Ever.” The girl seems familiar to Thomas, but he doesn’t know why. Later, Thomas sees a metal beetle engraved with the word WICKED; the beetle is a spy from the Creators of the Maze. Thomas goes into the Deadheads forest, where he is attacked by a delirious Ben. Before Ben can stab Thomas, Alby shoots an arrow through Ben’s face, wounding but not killing him.
While Thomas is working in the Blood House, he sees an Asian Runner collapse on the lawn. This Runner, Minho, tells Alby and Thomas that he found a dead Griever in the Maze. At dusk, the leaders, called Keepers, bring Ben from prison and push him into the Maze for attempting to murder Thomas. Ben shrieks and howls in terror as the walls close on him.
The next day, Minho and Alby go into the Maze to find the Griever, who, it turns out, was only pretending to be dead. By dinner, they haven’t returned. At the West Door, Thomas sees Minho half-carrying Alby, who has been stung. When Thomas realizes that they won’t make it into the Glade before the Doors close, he jumps into the Maze to help them.
Thomas secures himself and Alby high onto the wall with ivy ropes. A Griever appears, pursues Thomas, and is joined by three Grievers. Using an evasive maneuver, Minho and Thomas trick the Grievers into going off a cliff within the Maze, where they are instantly swallowed up by darkness. 
The next day, Alby is still alive on the wall, and he is taken down by other Gladers and given the Grief Serum. The Keepers are divided on what to do about Thomas: he violated the rules by entering the Maze, but he also saved Alby’s life. Minho and Gally fight over Thomas’ fate, and it’s finally decided that Thomas will spend the next day in the Slammer (the Glade’s jail), then join Minho as a Runner.
Word comes that Alby is awake and that he wants to talk to Thomas alone. Alby tells Thomas that during the Changing he learned some disturbing things about Thomas and the girl, and that he knows about “the Flare,” which means nothing to Thomas. Just as Alby is explain further, he starts to strangle himself. After Alby is restrained with Newt’s help, he says that an outside force was in control of his hands. Alby then gives Newt two instructions: “Be careful with the girl,” and “protect the Maps.”
When Thomas visits the girl, she tells him telepathically that her name is Teresa. In her coma, she still has memories and says she and Thomas caused this and were sent to end it. Thomas retreats to sleep in the south corner of the Deadheads.
After his day in jail, Thomas joins Minho. They run through Sections Eight and One of the Maze, then draw maps of those sections and add them to a trunk holding all the other daily maps. The other Runners do the same. That night, Teresa telepathically tells Thomas she has “triggered the Ending.” 
The next morning, the boys wake up to find that the sun has disappeared and the Glade is bathed in grey light. More disturbing is the fact that the walls of the Maze are now stuck in the open position, meaning that there’s nothing protecting the Glade from Grievers. Back in the Maze, Thomas and Minho follow a Griever, and when they see it throw itself off the cliff, they realize there’s a hole through which Grievers enter and exit the Maze. Teresa wakes up, and she and Thomas, who have a connection they don’t fully understand, speak to each other telepathically. Teresa is locked in the Slammer, and everyone else prepares for the Grievers to come through the open Maze doors into the Glade. 
Barricaded in a Homestead room, Newt, Alby, Minho, and Thomas hear the Grievers approach. Alby, very troubled, runs to the Map room. Gally bursts in and says the Grievers will kill one Glader each night until they’re all dead. As a Griever breaks through the window, Gally throws himself at it. The Griever takes Gally through the West Door and the other Grievers follow.
Alby has burned the Maps, but it turns out that Minho had already moved the real Maps to protect them. Teresa realizes that the Maps are a code, and that by stacking each day’s eight maps together, they can read letters, one letter each day. The Maps spell out six repeating words: FLOAT, CATCH, BLEED, DEATH, STIFF, PUSH. To gain more information, Thomas intentionally gets stung by a Griever, goes through the Changing, and realizes in his visions that the only way to escape the Maze is to jump into the Griever Hole and type in the code words. 
After a Gathering, the Keepers agree to the dangerous plan, and about half the Gladers assemble to escape. In the Maze, they’re surrounded by Grievers, but they fight valiantly to make a path for Thomas, Teresa, and Chuck to get to the Cliff. The three make it through the Hole and land in a greasy tunnel. Teresa types the words into a computer while Thomas fights, and kills, a Griever. The last word, PUSH, won’t enter, and Chuck realizes they need to push a button marked “Kill the Maze.” 
Thomas, Teresa, and Chuck by the eighteen surviving Gladers, including Newt and Minho, and they go down a winding slide, landing in an enormous lab. Ghostly scientists observe them. A woman enters the room with a boy who reveals himself to be Gally. Gally throws a knife at Thomas, but Chuck steps in to protect him and is killed. As Thomas grieves Chuck, an armed group arrives. They shoot the woman and scientists and lead the Gladers to a bus. 
One of the rescuers explains to Thomas that the world was burned up by a series of solar flares and then consumed by a disease they call the Flare. It’s rumored that there’s a cure in the Andes, and WICKED, the Creators’ organization, was testing orphaned children to see if they were tenacious enough to try and recover the cure. The Gladers are taken to a bright dormitory and given pizza, after which they fall asleep. 
A memo reveals that the woman in the lab, Ava Paige, was not actually killed, and that the “rescuers” are actually a part of the WICKED plan. WICKED will give the survivors, called Group A, one night’s sleep before sending them on the next part of the experiment. Another group, Group B, is reported to also have performed well."
Of,"Two migrant workers, George and Lennie, have been let off a bus miles away from the California farm where they are due to start work. George is a small, dark man with “sharp, strong features.” Lennie, his companion, is his opposite, a giant of a man with a “shapeless” face. Overcome with thirst, the two stop in a clearing by a pool and decide to camp for the night. As the two converse, it becomes clear that Lennie has an intellectual disability, and is deeply devoted to George and dependent upon him for protection and guidance. George finds that Lennie, who loves petting soft things but often accidentally kills them, has been carrying and stroking a dead mouse. George angrily throws it away, fearing that Lennie might catch a disease from the dead animal. George complains loudly that his life would be easier without having to care for Lennie, but the reader senses that their friendship and devotion is mutual. He and Lennie share a dream of buying their own piece of land, farming it, and, much to Lennie’s delight, keeping rabbits. George ends the night by treating Lennie to the story he often tells him about what life will be like in such an idyllic place.
The next day, the men report to the nearby ranch. George, fearing how the boss will react to Lennie, insists that he’ll do all the talking. He lies, explaining that they travel together because they are cousins and that a horse kicked Lennie in the head when he was a child. They are hired. They meet Candy, an old “swamper,” or handyman, with a missing hand and an ancient dog, and Curley, the boss’s mean-spirited son. Curley is newly married, possessive of his flirtatious wife, and full of jealous suspicion. Once George and Lennie are alone in the bunkhouse, Curley’s wife appears and flirts with them. Lennie thinks she is “purty,” but George, sensing the trouble that could come from tangling with this woman and her husband, warns Lennie to stay away from her. Soon, the ranch-hands return from the fields for lunch, and George and Lennie meet Slim, the skilled mule driver who wields great authority on the ranch. Slim comments on the rarity of friendship like that between George and Lennie. Carlson, another ranch-hand, suggests that since Slim’s dog has just given birth, they should offer a puppy to Candy and shoot Candy’s old, good-for-nothing dog.
The next day, George confides in Slim that he and Lennie are not cousins, but have been friends since childhood. He tells how Lennie has often gotten them into trouble. For instance, they were forced to flee their last job because Lennie tried to touch a woman’s dress and was accused of rape. Slim agrees to give Lennie one of his puppies, and Carlson continues to badger Candy to kill his old dog. When Slim agrees with Carlson, saying that death would be a welcome relief to the suffering animal, Candy gives in. Carlson, before leading the dog outside, promises to do the job painlessly.
Slim goes to the barn to do some work, and Curley, who is maniacally searching for his wife, heads to the barn to accost Slim. Candy overhears George and Lennie discussing their plans to buy land, and offers his life’s savings if they will let him live there too. The three make a pact to let no one else know of their plan. Slim returns to the bunkhouse, berating Curley for his suspicions. Curley, searching for an easy target for his anger, finds Lennie and picks a fight with him. Lennie crushes Curley’s hand in the altercation. Slim warns Curley that if he tries to get George and Lennie fired, he will be the laughingstock of the farm.
The next night, most of the men go to the local brothel. Lennie is left with Crooks, the lonely, Black stable-hand, and Candy. Curley’s wife flirts with them, refusing to leave until the other men come home. She notices the cuts on Lennie’s face and suspects that he, and not a piece of machinery as Curley claimed, is responsible for hurting her husband. This thought amuses her. The next day, Lennie accidentally kills his puppy in the barn. Curley’s wife enters and consoles him. She admits that life with Curley is a disappointment, and wishes that she had followed her dream of becoming a movie star. Lennie tells her that he loves petting soft things, and she offers to let him feel her hair. When he grabs too tightly, she cries out. In his attempt to silence her, he accidentally breaks her neck.
Lennie flees back to a pool of the Salinas River that George had designated as a meeting place should either of them get into trouble. As the men back at the ranch discover what has happened and gather together a lynch party, George joins Lennie. Much to Lennie’s surprise, George is not mad at him for doing “a bad thing.” George begins to tell Lennie the story of the farm they will have together. As he describes the rabbits that Lennie will tend, the sound of the approaching lynch party grows louder. George shoots his friend in the back of the head.
When the other men arrive, George lets them believe that Lennie had the gun, and George wrestled it away from him and shot him. Only Slim understands what has really happened, that George has killed his friend out of mercy. Slim consolingly leads him away, and the other men, completely puzzled, watch them leave."
Efficient,"In “moon,” the first of the four parts of feed, an American teenager named Titus travels to the lunar surface with his high-school friends for spring break, hoping to escape the boredom they feel on Earth. No specific date is revealed, though it’s sometime in a dystopic future, where the moon is fully commercialized and people suffer from red sores called lesions. As Titus and his fellow upper-class friends Link, Marty, Calista, Loga, and Quendy arrive on the moon, readers also get their first glimpse of “the feed.” Although Titus doesn’t initially reveal exact details about the feed or how it works, he says it sends the friends ads and images for where to stay and shop. 
After failing to get into college-age parties, the group visits the Ricochet Lounge, where Titus becomes infatuated with a girl named Violet. She is beautiful and, he soon finds, visiting the moon by herself and is very unlike his friends: She doesn’t make pointless purchases at a mall they all soon visit and isn’t interested in malfunctioning, or falling into a drug-like stupor, via their connections to the feed. Later, when they all visit a dance club called the Rumble Spot, an old man from a dissenter group called the Coalition of Pity hacks into people’s individual feeds, causing them to broadcast the signal, “we enter a time of calamity” over the feed’s network. Police beat the man and “shut off” those hacked, including Titus and Violet, who hold hands as they collapse.
Part 2, “eden,” occurs in a lunar hospital where Violet, Titus, and his friends remain disconnected from the feed until their systems can be scanned for viruses. There, Titus provides additional details about what the feed is and how it works. Feeds are implanted inside the body and connect to a global network that provides news, entertainment, and a means to purchase every kind of product, he says while singing its praises. The feed even anticipates and creates users’ wants from individual profiles based on purchasing decisions, thoughts, and feelings. Titus and Violet grow closer during the stay. Violet, who’s home-schooled and smarter than Titus and his friends, says she hoped to enjoy herself like normal kids but now has a problem, though she remains vague about what this problem is. When doctors finally restore the friends’ feeds, they rejoice. Promotions begin to flow through their minds again, though there’s also ominous news concerning protests over America’s annexation of the moon and resulting anger from a group called the Global Alliance. Still, Titus says, the friends exalt in the return of their feeds.
In Part 3, “Utopia,” Titus and his friends return to Earth and life returns to normal for them: “upcars” travel in tubes past vertically stacked suburbs, the friends party, and U.S. President Trumbull scoffs at reports that claim toxic industries cause lesions. In defiance of rampant consumerism and a loss of individuality, Violet determines to resist the feed by creating a completely random customer profile and asks Titus to join her. Violet, who didn’t receive her feed until she was seven, voices deep concern about the decline of the world and destruction of Earth, and laments how those who’ve had the feed their entire lives are ignorant and self-centered. Titus soon has nightmares that are more likely hacks from the Coalition of Pity. In them, he sees disturbing images of eco destruction and human suffering around the world, but after Violet chats him, saying she has seen the images too, he only wants to go back to sleep.
Before long, Violet’s problem becomes clear: Her body begins to fail and she’s told by doctors that the damage to her feedware can be fatal. The prognosis makes Violet realize how much she wants to do. She starts by going to the seashore with Titus, though they need to dress in protective suits due to its toxicity. Meanwhile, feed chatter reveals that all of Earth’s forests have fallen and there is a growing rift between the U.S. and the Global Alliance. At a party where Quendy shows off her artificial lesions, Violet becomes outraged and her body falters. She chastises Titus and his friends for living in ignorance as the world dies, then collapses and is brought to the hospital. 
Violet’s condition declines further in Part 4, “slumberland,” whose chapter titles track her feed efficiency from a high of 87.3 percent to a low of 4.6 percent, 98 percent being optimal. Aware that she doesn’t have much time, Violet messages Titus a list of twenty-two things she wants to do in life, though he grows increasingly distant, and doesn’t message back. When they do reconnect, Violet sends Titus a recent memory where she falls down a staircase and receives a response from the corporation FeedTech, denying her petition to pay for her system repairs because she wasn’t deemed to be worthy due to her random customer profile. Violet later sends Titus childhood memories to preserve her history, though he deletes them. And when Violet convinces him to visit the mountains with her, one of her life goals, Titus breaks up with her, saying he was only interested in a short relationship while she wanted something eternal. 
Time passes and Titus eventually hears from Violet’s father. At Violet’s home, Titus sees her lying on a floating bed, completely pale, fully incapacitated, and covered in discs. Her father details her final, painful days and how her body failed. He then berates Titus for how badly he treated Violet and for willfully living in ignorance. Titus later visits Violet’s home a second time. Although she appears dead, her feed efficiency is at 4.6 percent and a screen shows that her heart is beating slightly. Nevertheless, Titus tells Violet a story he plans to keep telling her, he says, so she will remember herself. The story is about Violet, the end of America, and their relationship, where they learn something important about love and how to resist the feed. The book ends with a promotion on the feed for Blue-Jean Warehouse’s Final Sales Event and a recurring, fading message that “Everything must go.”"
Regime,"Marjane “Marji” Satrapi is an intelligent, spirited, and very modern girl living with her parents in Iran’s capital of Tehran during the eventful period of Iranian history from the late 1970s into the early 1980s. In Persepolis: The Story of a Childhood, Marji’s remembers her life during those years, mostly from when she was about ten to age fourteen. This account includes how Marji and her family lived through and were affected by turbulent events that included the overthrow of the autocratic Shah of Iran by the Islamic revolution, the oppressive fundamentalist regime that replaced the Shah, and the devasting Iran-Iraq war.
The nation’s wealth has long made it a target of outside invaders, but Islamic revolution of 1979 has pushed out the Western-backed government of the Shah.  The revolution has ushered in a new Islamic regime that is bringing massive societal changes impacting how people are supposed to behave--including Marji and her family. Marji struggles to adjust to the changes at her liberal French bilingual school, which has become increasingly stricter. Girls are required to wear veils and female and male students are now separated. Marji’s wealthy and modern parents—her father, Ebi, and her mother, Taji—take part in the massive protests against the new regime’s strict rules on behavior (just as they had previously protested against the Shah’s regime). Marji’s parents worry when a photo of Marji’s mother a protest appears in newspapers magazines. Later, after a demonstration they are at turns violent, the Satrapis decide that openly protesting is too dangerous to continue to do.
Marji feels conflict between her own deeply spiritual feelings and the stark modernism of her parents. She talks to God at night and has believed she will become a prophet one day since she was six years old, Marji. But the revolution leads to Marji setting aside these ambitions while she studies and imitates protestors and revolutionaries. She mimics protestors in the garden of her house and studies books about famous revolutionaries and philosophers given to her by her parents. She fantasizes about becoming a hero and wants her parents to become heroes too. Marji’s relationship with God becomes strained, as she finds that she and God have less to talk about—although God does still come by to see her from time to time.
Marji thrills when she learns that rebels fill her family history. She learns that her grandfather was a prince and later a communist whom the Shah removed from power and that her uncle Anoosh, also a communist, spent nine years in prison during the Shah’s regime. Marji spends a short time with Anoosh, learning about his life. After the Shah fell from power in 1979, Anoosh was released from prison, but when Islamic fundamentalists consolidate their grip on power, they hunt Anoosh down, imprison him, and later execute him. Her new idol killed, Marji feels crushed. She completely abandons her faith in God and increasingly questions the pro-regime propaganda she hears—especially at school.
Marji deeply loves and identifies with of her parents, even if she does sometimes feel that their actions and behavior (as wealthy and privileged individuals) do not always live up to their pro-democratic and liberal rhetoric. Marji also has a special connection with her grandmother, who remains stoic and inspiring to Marji in spite of the turmoil and numerous tragedies stemming from political actions that impact her and the family. Marji’s uncle Anoosh is not Marji’s only direct experience with the cruel consequences of the government’s actions. Throughout the book, death and devastation occurs among Marji’s extended family and friends as direct results of the brutality and fanaticism of the Iranian regimes and the war with Iraq.
People had rejoiced when the Shah was forced out, but as Islamic fundamentalists retain power, Marji and her family watch as their neighbors’ behavior shifts back and forth to coincide with the current political winds. The neighbors go from wearing short skirts and drinking alcohol to covering themselves and denouncing the use of alcohol. Marji’s parents ask her to tell everyone that she prays every day, a lie they hope will keep Marji safe, but acknowledge that the rules seem foolish. Marji grows more rebellious, as she increasingly views the rules at school and elsewhere as hypocritical and difficult to follow. Armed with more knowledge and personal experience, Marji begins to act out in ways that put her safety at risk. In fact, she even (accidentally) hits her principal during an argument, which results in her expulsion from school. Fearing her rebellious behavior will get her killed, Marji’s mother tries to reason with Marji by telling her that it is not her responsibility to serve justice and that the bad guys eventually pay for their sins in the end.
The war with Iraq had originally inspired Marji to vocal patriotism in protection her country against another invasion, but Marji begins to realize there are greater forces behind the war. She sees how the Islamic regime needs the war to continue survive and keep power. The war promotes a sense of nationalism and pride in the public, and those who die in the war are hailed as “martyrs.” Marji sees thousands of poor boys lured into war without proper training. She becomes increasingly uncomfortable and aware of class differences within society. Poor young boys are lured into the army with gold-painted keys to the “kingdom of heaven” to help them enter paradise after dying on the battlefield, while children in her wealthy neighborhood are left alone.
More and more people try to escape Iran as the borders tighten and Iraqi forces bomb Tehran and other Iranian cities. Realizing that Marji’s chances of escaping Iran are narrowing, her parents make the difficult decision to send her abroad alone to finish school in Vienna, explaining that only a good education will free her of Iran. Marji feels heartbroken. She spends one last night with her grandmother, who gives her warm advice and inspires her to be compassionate and understanding while in Vienna. Marji gives away all of her prized contraband to her friends, including a Kim Wilde poster. At the airport, as Marji turns to say goodbye to her parents one last time to see that her mother, devasted by her only child’s departure, has fainted."
Xwe,"Cadence, nearly eighteen, narrates her story in the first person. In Part One (“Welcome”), she describes the three generations of her family, the Sinclairs; Granddad, widowed; his three daughters, all divorced or separated from their husbands; and Cadence and her six cousins. The family spends every summer on a family-owned island. One aunt’s longtime boyfriend and his nephew, Gat, always join them there, even though Granddad doesn’t like the fact that they are of South Asian descent. Cadence, her two oldest cousins, and Gat are known in the family as “the Liars,” for unexplained reasons. Cadence and Gat fell in love when Cadence was fourteen, but the next summer there was an accident of some sort. Cadence doesn’t recall much, but apparently she suffered a head injury. She now has migraines, for which she takes prescription pain medication. None of the Liars stayed in touch with Cadence during her long recovery. The following summer, when her father took her on a trip to Europe, they didn’t reply to her emails.
In Part Two (“Vermont”), Cadence struggles to remember more of her accident. When she asks Penny for details, Penny replies tearfully that Cadence has asked many times before, and always finds the answers upsetting. When Cadence’s father wants to take her to Europe again next summer, Cadence insists on returning to the island. Her mother and father reluctantly settle on a plan for her to spend just the first month of the summer there. Meanwhile, it becomes clear during a visit from Granddad and a phone call with one of the younger cousins that all is not well with the family. Granddad’s mind is starting to fail, the younger cousins gossip about Cadence being a drug addict, and the cousin on the phone thinks the island is haunted.
Part Three (“Summer Seventeen”) begins with Cadence’s arrival at the island. To her shock, the old Victorian house where Granddad and Granny used to live has been completely rebuilt, as an unattractive modern structure. She reunites awkwardly with her aunts and the younger cousins, but her reunion with the Liars goes better, despite her resentment over not hearing from them in the last two years. The four Liars agree to stay together and not to spend much time with the rest of the family. Over the next week or two, Cadence begins to remember what happened two summers ago. Granddad and his daughters argued about the family home back in Boston. One aunt was resentful over the condition of her house on the island. Granddad also snapped at Cadence one day, about his right to do with his money as he pleased. In the present, Cadence makes progress reconnecting with the Liars, but they’re not very responsive to her questions about her accident.
In Part Four (“Look, a Fire”), Cadence starts to grasp what really happened. There had been an ugly showdown between Granddad and his daughters, about the division of the family inheritance. The fight ended with all four adults angrily leaving the island for a short time, taking the younger cousins with them. The Liars stayed behind. Since much of the family conflict had been about Granddad’s house and its contents, the Liars had deliberately burned the house down. Cadence is pleased that in the new house, Granddad and his daughters treat each other more kindly. Cadence’s feelings change, however, when she realizes that Granddad’s two dogs died in the fire. She and the other Liars are responsible for their deaths.
In Part Five (“Truth”), finally, Cadence confronts the whole truth: she alone survived the fire. The other three Liars died. They have spent the last few weeks with Cadence as ghosts, waiting for her to remember and understand. Now the Liars must leave. Cadence says final goodbyes to her two cousins and her beloved Gat. She carries with her the guilty knowledge of her role in their deaths. She is resolved to be kinder toward her surviving family from now on."
Invokes,"Speak, by Laurie Halse Anderson, chronicles the struggles of thirteen-year-old Melinda Sordino after she is a raped by at a party the summer before her freshman year of high school by another student. Melinda tells her story in first person narrative. She describes events within the framework of the four marking periods of the school year.
In the opening part of Speak, “First Marking Period,” Melinda begins high school, and we learn that former friends now hate her. She experiences humiliation in the cafeteria and Mr. Neck, a social studies teacher, further embarrasses her by giving her demerits on the first day of school. Ostracized by her former friends, she befriends Heather, a new girl at the school. Heather seeks popularity, and she badgers Melinda to join various clubs. Rachel, Melinda’s ex-best friend, hasn’t tried to find out the truth about what really happened to Melinda that night at the party over the summer.
Melinda describes her classes, activities, and thoughts. Her project in Mr. Freeman’s art class is to create a work of art based on a “tree,” which is the object named on the piece of paper she randomly chooses. In biology, Melinda thinks that David Petrakis, her lab partner, might be cute without the braces. And in algebra, when Mr. Stetman has Rachel come to the board to help Melinda with a problem, Melinda is humiliated. 
Melinda often skips class using stolen late passes and doesn’t complete her homework. She finds refuge at school in a vacant janitor’s closet, which she turns into her “burrow.” At the Homecoming Rally, students bully her for being the one who called the cops that night at the party.
At home, Melinda and her parents communicate with each other by leaving notes on the refrigerator. In her bedroom, she no longer wants to look in the mirror and puts it in the back of her closet. Toward the end of the marking period, Melinda’s parents hear from the school about her missing work, and she remains silent while they berate her for failing. Through it all, Melinda sees “IT” everywhere, the nightmare from which she cannot awaken.
In “Second Marking Period,” school is a grind for Melinda. At her parents’ insistence, she stays after to finish her homework, but she goes to her burrow and naps instead. In social studies, David Petrakis stands up against Mr. Neck’s racist rant about immigration. In biology, she finds that a seed within the apple she has cut is already growing. Heather gives her an early Christmas present, and Melinda decides she’ll give Heather a friendship necklace. 
On Christmas, Melinda nearly tells her parents what happened that night last summer but can’t. Winter break is miserable. Her parents keep her busy working for them, and she is relieved when school starts again. 
In gym class, Melinda impresses the basketball coaches with skills but has no interest in being on the team. She reluctantly helps Heather in her attempts to become an initiated member of a do-good club. And in biology, when she and David dissect a frog, she faints when preparing to slice it open. 
Melinda’s parents receive another call from the guidance counselor about her grades. After their verbal assault, Melinda goes to her room and uses an open paper clip to scrape at her wrist. 
“IT”, who we learn is Andy Evans, harasses Melinda in the cafeteria, and she runs to the bathroom to vomit. She has yet to tell anyone, even the reader, about what happened that summer night.
In “Third Marking Period,” Melinda continues to skip school and avoid Andy Evans. Heather ends their friendship suddenly, and later returns the friendship necklace Melinda had given her for Christmas. No one, Melinda is sure, “would like the inside girl I think I am.” 
The school counselors hold another meeting with Melinda’s parents, who berate and threaten her. She refuses to talk or defend herself. She receives In-School Suspension, and IT is there. He sits next to her and blows in her ear when Mr. Neck isn’t looking. 
In art class, Mr. Freeman gives Melinda a book about Picasso to help her “paralyzed” imagination. Picasso’s art inspires her, and she begins to draw. Mr. Freeman recognizes that she has a lot to say.
Melinda works to meet the expectations set for her. Yet, with “no friends in the known universe,” Melinda sits alone at lunch, wondering if everyone is talking and laughing about her. 
One afternoon, after a basketball game, David Petrakis invites her to his house for pizza to celebrate the team’s one-point win. She declines, torn between getting a life, and the fact that the world is a dangerous place.
At last, Melinda reveals that she was attacked at a party last summer, though she does not use the word “rape.” At this point, we (the readers) are the only ones besides Melinda who know what happened.
In “Fourth Marking Period,” Melinda takes her ex-friend Ivy’s advice and tries drawing a tree instead of carving one from linoleum block. She also learns that Rachel is dating Andy Evans. Compelled to do something, she writes a note to Rachel warning her about Andy. In the note, she admits for the first time (but without divulging her identity), that she was raped. 
Springtime arrives, and Melinda finds solace working in the garden. She and David plan a protest in social studies class over an oral report she is supposed to present, and she stands up to Heather by refusing to help her decorate for the Senior Prom. She writes on a stall in the bathroom, “Guys to Stay Away From: Andy Evans.” Andy Evans continues to bully her. 
Melinda feels compelled to tell Rachel the truth about Andy and what happened that night. But, when Rachel learns that Andy Evans was Melinda’s attacker, she accuses Melinda of being jealous and calls her a “twisted little freak.” Later, Ivy brings Melinda into the bathroom stall. Other girls have added words like “creep” and “bastard” under Andy Evan’s name. Seeing that, Melinda feels like she can fly.
Melinda realizes she doesn’t need her burrow anymore. When she is clearing her items out of the closet, Andy Evans barges in, attacks Melinda, and tries to rape her again. She finds her voice and screams “NNNOOO!!” He does not back off, so Melinda breaks a mirror, takes a shard of glass, and holds it to his neck. “I said no,” she tells him. People who had heard her scream run for help.
With hours left in the school year, Melinda finds herself a sort of hero. She finishes her tree project, receiving an A+ from Mr. Freeman."
Shake,"The novel begins in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1968. Ashima Ganguli, expecting a child, makes a snack for herself in the kitchen of her apartment, which she shares with her husband, Ashoke. The two met in Calcutta, where their marriage was arranged by their parents. Ashoke is a graduate student in electrical engineering at MIT. Though Ashima was afraid to move across the world with a man she barely knew, she dutifully did so, satisfying her family’s wishes. She gives birth to a boy in the hospital in Cambridge. Ashoke, nearly killed in a train accident as a young man in India, decides that the boy’s nickname, or pet name, should be Gogol, after Nikolai Gogol, the Russian writer. Ashima and Ashoke agree to register the boy’s legal name as “Gogol.”Gogol is Ashoke’s favorite author, in part because Ashoke was reading Gogol during the train accident. A dropped page of that book caused the authorities to recognize Ashoke in the wreckage, and they saved his life.
The Gangulis wait for an “official” name for Gogol to come in the mail, from Calcutta. But Ashima’s grandmother, who has the ceremonial honor of naming the boy, suffers a stroke, and her letter with Gogol’s official name is lost in the mail. The family settles into life in Cambridge, with Ashima learning to take Gogol around on her errands. As the family prepares for its first trip back to Calcutta, Ashoke and Ashima learn that Ashima’s father has died suddenly. Their trip is shrouded in mourning. Ashima, especially, misses her parents and her home in Calcutta, despite the family’s growing network of Bengali friends in the Boston area.
The Gangulis move to a Boston suburb, a university town where Ashoke has found a job teaching electrical engineering. Gogol begins preschool, then kindergarten, and Ashima misses spending time with him, and walking around the neighborhood. Gogol begins school, and although his parents have settled on an official name, Nikhil, for him to use there, Gogol insists on being called “Gogol,” and so the name sticks. Ashima and Ashoke have another child, a girl named Sonia. Years pass, and the family settles into the modest house in the suburbs, on Pemberton Road. In high school, Gogol grows resentful of his name, which he finds strange, not “really” Indian. He learns about the life of Nikolai Gogol in a literature class, and is horrified by that man’s bizarre, unhappy existence. Ashoke gives Gogol a copy of Gogol’s stories for his fourteenth birthday, and almost tells him the story of his train accident, but holds back. Gogol hides the book in a closet and forgets about it.
Gogol officially changes his name to Nikhil before going to Yale. He meets a girl there named Ruth, and they fall in love, dating for over a year. After waiting hurriedly for Gogol’s delayed Amtrak train, one holiday weekend, Ashoke tells his son about the train-wreck that nearly killed him, and that gave Gogol his name. Gogol was unaware of the story until this point. Nikhil develops a love for architecture, and after graduating from Yale, he attends design school at Columbia, then lives uptown and works for a firm in Manhattan. He meets a young woman in New York named Maxine, who leads a cosmopolitan life with her parents downtown. Nikhil essentially moves into Maxine’s home, and the two date seriously. Gogol introduces Maxine to his parents one summer, then spends two weeks in New Hampshire with Maxine’s family, the Ratliffs, believing that their life, as opposed to his parents’, is paradise.
Ashoke takes a visiting professorship outside Cleveland and moves there for the academic year. He comes home every three weeks to see Ashima and take care of household chores. Ashoke calls Ashima one night and tells her he has been admitted to the hospital for a minor stomach ailment. When Ashima calls back, she finds out that Ashoke has died of a heart attack. The family is stunned. Gogol flies to Cleveland and cleans out his father’s apartment. The family observes traditional Bengali mourning practices, from which Maxine feels excluded. Soon after this period is over, Maxine and Gogol break up.
Gogol continues his life in New York, though he visits his mother and sister in Boston more frequently. Ashima sets Gogol up with Moushumi, a family friend from Pemberton Road, who now studies for a French-literature PhD in New York. Gogol and Moushumi initially resist this blind date, but find that they like and understand one another. They continue dating and soon fall in love. After about a year, they marry in a large Bengali ceremony in New Jersey, near where Moushumi’s parents now live. They rent an apartment together downtown.
Time passes. The couple takes a trip to Paris, where Moushumi delivers a paper at a conference. The marriage strains. Moushumi likes spending time with her artistic, Brooklyn friends, whereas Gogol finds them frustrating and selfish. Gogol also resents the specter of Graham, Moushumi’s banker ex-fiancé, who was good friends with the artistic crew Moushumi still adores. Moushumi, feeling confined in the marriage, begins an affair with an old friend, an aimless academic named Dimitri Desjardins. She keeps the affair from Gogol for several months, but eventually Nikhil catches her in a lie, and she admits all to him. They divorce.
Gogol returns to Pemberton Road for a final Christmas party. His sister Sonia is marrying a man named Ben and staying in the Boston area. Ashima will spend half her time in Boston and half in Calcutta, close to relatives. Gogol will continue working as an architect in New York, but for a smaller firm where he has more creative input. Nikhil goes up to his room and finds the copy of Gogol’s stories his father gave him, realizing how much the author meant to his father. Gogol, feeling close to Ashoke’s memory, begins reading the Gogol as the novel ends."
Captive,"On the morning of February 10, 1675, the British settlement of Lancaster, in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, is besieged by Native Americans. The attackers burn down houses and open fire on the settlers, wounding and killing several of them, and take a number of the survivors captive. Mary Rowlandson is one of the wounded, as is her youngest child, Sarah. Other members of Rowlandson’s family are killed outright. As the melee dies down, the Native Americans begin to lead their captives, including Rowlandson and her three children, from the settlement into the surrounding wilderness. At this point, Rowlandson and her two elder children are separated, but she and the youngest are allowed to remain together.
After a night spent in an abandoned town nearby, from which colonists had fled in fear of Indian attack, the captors and their captives begin to trek westward, farther into the forest. As Rowlandson and her daughter are both wounded, the journey is difficult and painful. After another day of travel, they reach an Indian settlement called Wenimesset. Here, Rowlandson meets another British captive, Robert Pepper, who wants to offer the new captives comfort. The Indians and their captives remain in Wenimesset for over a week, and during this time, Rowlandson’s wounded child becomes more ill, finally dying on February 18. By this time, Rowlandson’s original captor has sold her to a Saggamore Indian named Quannopin, who is related by marriage to King Philip. Quannopin oversees the burial of Rowlandson’s dead child, and a grieving Rowlandson visits her elder daughter (also named Mary), who she learns is also being held in Wenimesset. As she despairs over the fate of her family, her son visits her—he has been allowed to come from the nearby Indian settlement where he is being held in captivity. Meanwhile, the Indians continue to attack British towns, including Medfield, killing and looting as they go. Her captors give Rowlandson a Bible, part of the spoils of Medfield, and in it she finds comfort and hope.
After the fighting at Medfield, the Indians decide again to “remove” westward, now heading north as well. Rowlandson is again separated from her family and acquaintances. After a four-day rest in the forest, the band of Indians with whom Rowlandson is traveling begins to travel more swiftly. Rowlandson suspects that the British army must be close. They reach the Baquaug River and cross it, and the English arrive close behind. The British soldiers, however, are unable to ford the river, and the Indians and Rowlandson continue to the northwest. Rowlandson and her captors soon reach the Connecticut River, which they plan to cross in order to meet with King Philip. Here, however, are English scouts, and the Indians and Rowlandson are forced to scatter in the forest to remain undetected. Rowlandson again meets up with her son and his captors, though they must soon part ways.
After this detour, Rowlandson and the Indians cross the river, and on the other side, she meets with King Philip as planned. For some time, she remains at this settlement, sewing clothes for the Indians in return for food. The Indians, meanwhile, raid Northampton and return with spoils, including horses. Rowlandson asks to be taken to Albany on horseback, hoping that there she will be “sold” in exchange for gunpowder, but instead, the Indians prepare to take her northward and over the river once more.
After a brief sojourn at a settlement five miles north of King Philip’s abode, Rowlandson’s captors once again bring her north but then turn south again. Rowlandson hopes she’ll be returned home, but the Indians delay the journey, continuing south down the Connecticut River rather than turning east toward civilization. Indian attacks on British towns continue, and another captive, Thomas Read, joins Rowlandson’s group. From Read, Rowlandson learns that her husband is alive and well, which heartens her. Rowlandson also sees her son again, briefly. Rowlandson and her captors finally begin to move east.
They again cross the Baquaug River. Messengers meet them and report that Rowlandson must go to Wachuset, where the Indians will meet to discuss her possible return to freedom. More hopeful than she has been in some time, Rowlandson eagerly sets off toward the council’s meeting place. But the journey tires her, and she is disheartened by the sight of an injured colonist, wounded in still another Indian attack. At Wachuset, she speaks with King Philip, who promises her she’ll be free in two weeks. Nonetheless, the council continues to deliberate, asking Rowlandson how much her husband would be willing to pay them as ransom. The Indians then send a letter to Boston, stating that Rowlandson can be redeemed for twenty pounds. Meanwhile, attacks on British settlements continue, including an attack on Sudbury, after which Rowlandson must travel with her captors back into the forest.
As the Indians celebrate their victories, messengers arrive from the council, along with an Englishman named John Hoar. Rowlandson hopes she’ll be allowed to leave with Hoar, but negotiations continue for several more days. Rowlandson is finally allowed to travel back to now-abandoned Lancaster, then on to Concord, and finally to Boston. After nearly twelve weeks in the wilderness, Rowlandson is reunited with her husband. The two stay with a friend in Concord for eleven weeks, during which time Rowlandson’s sister is also released from her captivity. Rowlandson’s son and daughter are eventually returned as well. The family, together again at last, sets up a new household in Boston, where they continue to live until 1677."
Intricate,"Guy Montag is a fireman who burns books in a futuristic American city. In Montag’s world, firemen start fires rather than putting them out. The people in this society do not read books, enjoy nature, spend time by themselves, think independently, or have meaningful conversations. Instead, they drive very fast, watch excessive amounts of television on wall-size sets, and listen to the radio on “Seashell Radio” sets attached to their ears.
Montag encounters a gentle seventeen-year-old girl named Clarisse McClellan, who opens his eyes to the emptiness of his life with her innocently penetrating questions and her unusual love of people and nature. Over the next few days, Montag experiences a series of disturbing events. First, his wife, Mildred, attempts suicide by swallowing a bottle of sleeping pills. Then, when he responds to an alarm that an old woman has a stash of hidden literature, the woman shocks him by choosing to be burned alive along with her books. A few days later, he hears that Clarisse has been killed by a speeding car. Montag’s dissatisfaction with his life increases, and he begins to search for a solution in a stash of books that he has stolen from his own fires and hidden inside an air-conditioning vent.
When Montag fails to show up for work, his fire chief, Beatty, pays a visit to his house. Beatty explains that it’s normal for a fireman to go through a phase of wondering what books have to offer, and he delivers a dizzying monologue explaining how books came to be banned in the first place. According to Beatty, special-interest groups and other “minorities” objected to books that offended them. Soon, books all began to look the same, as writers tried to avoid offending anybody. This was not enough, however, and society as a whole decided to simply burn books rather than permit conflicting opinions. Beatty tells Montag to take twenty-four hours or so to see if his stolen books contain anything worthwhile and then turn them in for incineration. Montag begins a long and frenzied night of reading.
Overwhelmed by the task of reading, Montag looks to his wife for help and support, but she prefers television to her husband’s company and cannot understand why he would want to take the terrible risk of reading books. He remembers that he once met a retired English professor named Faber sitting in a park, and he decides that this man might be able to help him understand what he reads. He visits Faber, who tells him that the value of books lies in the detailed awareness of life that they contain. Faber says that Montag needs not only books but also the leisure to read them and the freedom to act upon their ideas.
Faber agrees to help Montag with his reading, and they concoct a risky scheme to overthrow the status quo. Faber will contact a printer and begin reproducing books, and Montag will plant books in the homes of firemen to discredit the profession and to destroy the machinery of censorship. Faber gives him a two-way radio earpiece (the “green bullet”) so that he can hear what Montag hears and talk to him secretly.
Montag goes home, and soon two of his wife’s friends arrive to watch television. The women discuss their families and the war that is about to be declared in an extremely frivolous manner. Their superficiality angers him, and he takes out a book of poetry and reads “Dover Beach” by Matthew Arnold. Faber buzzes in his ear for him to be quiet, and Mildred tries to explain that the poetry reading is a standard way for firemen to demonstrate the uselessness of literature. The women are extremely disturbed by the poem and leave to file a complaint against Montag.
Montag goes to the fire station and hands over one of his books to Beatty. Beatty confuses Montag by barraging him with contradictory quotations from great books. Beatty exploits these contradictions to show that literature is morbid and dangerously complex, and that it deserves incineration. Suddenly, the alarm sounds, and they rush off to answer the call, only to find that the alarm is at Montag’s own house. Mildred gets into a cab with her suitcase, and Montag realizes that his own wife has betrayed him.
Beatty forces Montag to burn the house himself; when he is done, Beatty places him under arrest. When Beatty continues to berate Montag, Montag turns the flamethrower on his superior and proceeds to burn him to ashes. Montag knocks the other firemen unconscious and runs. The Mechanical Hound, a monstrous machine that Beatty has set to attack Montag, pounces and injects Montag’s leg with a large dose of anesthetic. Montag manages to destroy it with his flamethrower; then he walks off the numbness in his leg and escapes with some books that were hidden in his backyard. He hides these in another fireman’s house and calls in an alarm from a pay phone.
Montag goes to Faber’s house, where he learns that a new Hound has been put on his trail, along with several helicopters and a television crew. Faber tells Montag that he is leaving for St. Louis to see a retired printer who may be able to help them. Montag gives Faber some money and tells him how to remove Montag’s scent from his house so the Hound will not enter it. Montag then takes some of Faber’s old clothes and runs off toward the river. The whole city watches as the chase unfolds on TV, but Montag manages to escape in the river and change into Faber’s clothes to disguise his scent. He drifts downstream into the country and follows a set of abandoned railroad tracks until he finds a group of renegade intellectuals (“the Book People”), led by a man named Granger, who welcome him. They are a part of a nationwide network of book lovers who have memorized many great works of literature and philosophy. They hope that they may be of some help to mankind in the aftermath of the war that has just been declared. Montag’s role is to memorize the Book of Ecclesiastes. Enemy jets appear in the sky and completely obliterate the city with bombs. Montag and his new friends move on to search for survivors and rebuild civilization."
Longer,"Obi Okonkwo is a young man, about twenty-six years old, who returns to Nigeria after studying in England at a university for four years. No Longer At Ease, begins with a trial against Obi that takes place a while after his return, and the novel then works its way backward to explain how Obi has come to be charged with accepting a bribe.
The Umuofia Progressive Union (U.P.U.) has given Obi a scholarship to study law in England, a scholarship that Obi has to pay back upon his return. And, thus, he leaves for England, stopping in Lagos on the way out. While in England, several things happen to him. First, he changes his course of study to English and abandons law. Secondly, he finds himself nostalgic for home, writing poems about Nigeria. Finally, he meets a girl named Clara at a dance in London but fails to make a good impression. However, the girl is Nigerian also, and on Obi's boat ride back home, after nearly four years in England, he meets Clara once again. This time, they begin a relationship.
Once back in Nigeria, Obi stays, once again, in Lagos with his friend Joseph, trying to find a job and a place of his own. He also visits his own home village of Umuofia. Obi is quickly given a post on the Scholarship Board of the Civil Service and is also quickly introduced to the world of bribery, which is a world he wholeheartedly rejects with a strong idealism at first. This is indicated early on when a man offers Obi money in order for Obi to ""pull strings"" for his little sister's scholarship. Obi is appalled and rejects the offer, only later to be met at home by the little sister herself who offers Obi her body in return for the scholarship favor. Again, Obi rejects this offer.
Although Obi begins his life in Nigeria in an honest way, events do not go as he has planned. First, Clara tells him that she cannot marry him because she is an osu, an outcast. Obi decides to ignore this and go against what most of his fellow countrymen believe to be a major transgression of custom, and he decides he will marry her anyway. Still, his economic hardship worsens, given that he has to send money home and that he is in debt. Obi then receives a letter from his father telling him that he must go home. When he arrives at home he sees that his mother is very ill. And, his parents tell him he must not marry Clara because she is an osu. In fact, Obi's dying mother gives him an ultimatum: she tells him that if he insists on marrying Clara, he must wait until she is dead because if he marries Clara while she is alive, she will kill herself.
Obi, therefore returns back to Lagos and tells Clara all that has transpired. Clara becomes angry and breaks off the engagement, afterwards hinting at the fact that she is pregnant. It is at this point when Obi arranges an abortion. He does not have the money and needs to borrow it. Complications arise out of the operation, and Clara is hospitalized, after which she refuses to see Obi.
Obi then returns to work, only to be notified that his mother has died. He does not go home for the funeral, and the U.P.U. discusses this failure on Obi's behalf as a sign of his not having cared about his mother's death. The truth, however, is that he was terribly saddened by her death, feels terrible remorse and guilt, and has entered into a state of mental unrest. However, Obi awakes from this unrest with a new sense of calm. He feels like a new man, and it is at this point that he takes his first bribe, not without a certain degree of guilt.
Obi allows this acceptance of bribes to become habitual. He continues to take bribes until the end of the novel, when Obi decides he cannot stand it anymore. He has paid off all of his debts and can no longer be a part of the corruption. It is at this moment, however, when he has taken his last bribe, that he is caught, which brings us back to the beginning of the novel."
Staunchest,"Don Quixote is a middle-aged gentleman from the region of La Mancha in central Spain. Obsessed with the chivalrous ideals touted in books he has read, he decides to take up his lance and sword to defend the helpless and destroy the wicked. After a first failed adventure, he sets out on a second one with a somewhat befuddled laborer named Sancho Panza, whom he has persuaded to accompany him as his faithful squire. In return for Sancho’s services, Don Quixote promises to make Sancho the wealthy governor of an isle. On his horse, Rocinante, a barn nag well past his prime, Don Quixote rides the roads of Spain in search of glory and grand adventure. He gives up food, shelter, and comfort, all in the name of a peasant woman, Dulcinea del Toboso, whom he envisions as a princess.
On his second expedition, Don Quixote becomes more of a bandit than a savior, stealing from and hurting baffled and justifiably angry citizens while acting out against what he perceives as threats to his knighthood or to the world. Don Quixote abandons a boy, leaving him in the hands of an evil farmer simply because the farmer swears an oath that he will not harm the boy. He steals a barber’s basin that he believes to be the mythic Mambrino’s helmet, and he becomes convinced of the healing powers of the Balsam of Fierbras, an elixir that makes him so ill that, by comparison, he later feels healed. Sancho stands by Don Quixote, often bearing the brunt of the punishments that arise from Don Quixote’s behavior.
The story of Don Quixote’s deeds includes the stories of those he meets on his journey. Don Quixote witnesses the funeral of a student who dies as a result of his love for a disdainful lady turned shepherdess. He frees a wicked and devious galley slave, Gines de Pasamonte, and unwittingly reunites two bereaved couples, Cardenio and Lucinda, and Ferdinand and Dorothea. Torn apart by Ferdinand’s treachery, the four lovers finally come together at an inn where Don Quixote sleeps, dreaming that he is battling a giant.
Along the way, the simple Sancho plays the straight man to Don Quixote, trying his best to correct his master’s outlandish fantasies. Two of Don Quixote’s friends, the priest and the barber, come to drag him home. Believing that he is under the force of an enchantment, he accompanies them, thus ending his second expedition and the First Part of the novel.
The Second Part of the novel begins with a passionate invective against a phony sequel of Don Quixote that was published in the interim between Cervantes’s two parts. Everywhere Don Quixote goes, his reputation—gleaned by others from both the real and the false versions of the story—precedes him.
As the two embark on their journey, Sancho lies to Don Quixote, telling him that an evil enchanter has transformed Dulcinea into a peasant girl. Undoing this enchantment, in which even Sancho comes to believe, becomes Don Quixote’s chief goal.
Don Quixote meets a Duke and Duchess who conspire to play tricks on him. They make a servant dress up as Merlin, for example, and tell Don Quixote that Dulcinea’s enchantment—which they know to be a hoax—can be undone only if Sancho whips himself 3,300 times on his naked backside. Under the watch of the Duke and Duchess, Don Quixote and Sancho undertake several adventures. They set out on a flying wooden horse, hoping to slay a giant who has turned a princess and her lover into metal figurines and bearded the princess’s female servants.
During his stay with the Duke, Sancho becomes governor of a fictitious isle. He rules for ten days until he is wounded in an onslaught the Duke and Duchess sponsor for their entertainment. Sancho reasons that it is better to be a happy laborer than a miserable governor.
A young maid at the Duchess’s home falls in love with Don Quixote, but he remains a staunch worshipper of Dulcinea. Their never-consummated affair amuses the court to no end. Finally, Don Quixote sets out again on his journey, but his demise comes quickly. Shortly after his arrival in Barcelona, the Knight of the White Moon—actually an old friend in disguise—vanquishes him.
Cervantes relates the story of Don Quixote as a history, which he claims he has translated from a manuscript written by a Moor named Cide Hamete Benengeli. Cervantes becomes a party to his own fiction, even allowing Sancho and Don Quixote to modify their own histories and comment negatively upon the false history published in their names.
In the end, the beaten and battered Don Quixote forswears all the chivalric truths he followed so fervently and dies from a fever. With his death, knights-errant become extinct. Benengeli returns at the end of the novel to tell us that illustrating the demise of chivalry was his main purpose in writing the history of Don Quixote."
Continuation,"In a series of letters, Robert Walton, the captain of a ship bound for the North Pole, recounts to his sister back in England the progress of his dangerous mission. Successful early on, the mission is soon interrupted by seas full of impassable ice. Trapped, Walton encounters Victor Frankenstein, who has been traveling by dog-drawn sledge across the ice and is weakened by the cold. Walton takes him aboard ship, helps nurse him back to health, and hears the fantastic tale of the monster that Frankenstein created.
Victor first describes his early life in Geneva. At the end of a blissful childhood spent in the company of Elizabeth Lavenza (his cousin in the 1818 edition, his adopted sister in the 1831 edition) and friend Henry Clerval, Victor enters the university of Ingolstadt to study natural philosophy and chemistry. There, he is consumed by the desire to discover the secret of life and, after several years of research, becomes convinced that he has found it.
Armed with the knowledge he has long been seeking, Victor spends months feverishly fashioning a creature out of old body parts. One climactic night, in the secrecy of his apartment, he brings his creation to life. When he looks at the monstrosity that he has created, however, the sight horrifies him. After a fitful night of sleep, interrupted by the specter of the monster looming over him, he runs into the streets, eventually wandering in remorse. Victor runs into Henry, who has come to study at the university, and he takes his friend back to his apartment. Though the monster is gone, Victor falls into a feverish illness.
Sickened by his horrific deed, Victor prepares to return to Geneva, to his family, and to health. Just before departing Ingolstadt, however, he receives a letter from his father informing him that his youngest brother, William, has been murdered. Grief-stricken, Victor hurries home. While passing through the woods where William was strangled, he catches sight of the monster and becomes convinced that the monster is his brother’s murderer. Arriving in Geneva, Victor finds that Justine Moritz, a kind, gentle girl who had been adopted by the Frankenstein household, has been accused. She is tried, condemned, and executed, despite her assertions of innocence. Victor grows despondent, guilty with the knowledge that the monster he has created bears responsibility for the death of two innocent loved ones.
Hoping to ease his grief, Victor takes a vacation to the mountains. While he is alone one day, crossing an enormous glacier, the monster approaches him. The monster admits to the murder of William but begs for understanding. Lonely, shunned, and forlorn, he says that he struck out at William in a desperate attempt to injure Victor, his cruel creator. The monster begs Victor to create a mate for him, a monster equally grotesque to serve as his sole companion.
Victor refuses at first, horrified by the prospect of creating a second monster. The monster is eloquent and persuasive, however, and he eventually convinces Victor. After returning to Geneva, Victor heads for England, accompanied by Henry, to gather information for the creation of a female monster. Leaving Henry in Scotland, he secludes himself on a desolate island in the Orkneys and works reluctantly at repeating his first success. One night, struck by doubts about the morality of his actions, Victor glances out the window to see the monster glaring in at him with a frightening grin. Horrified by the possible consequences of his work, Victor destroys his new creation. The monster, enraged, vows revenge, swearing that he will be with Victor on Victor’s wedding night.
Later that night, Victor takes a boat out onto a lake and dumps the remains of the second creature in the water. The wind picks up and prevents him from returning to the island. In the morning, he finds himself ashore near an unknown town. Upon landing, he is arrested and informed that he will be tried for a murder discovered the previous night. Victor denies any knowledge of the murder, but when shown the body, he is shocked to behold his friend Henry Clerval, with the mark of the monster’s fingers on his neck. Victor falls ill, raving and feverish, and is kept in prison until his recovery, after which he is acquitted of the crime.
Shortly after returning to Geneva with his father, Victor marries Elizabeth. He fears the monster’s warning and suspects that he will be murdered on his wedding night. To be cautious, he sends Elizabeth away to wait for him. While he awaits the monster, he hears Elizabeth scream and realizes that the monster had been hinting at killing his new bride, not himself. Victor returns home to his father, who dies of grief a short time later. Victor vows to devote the rest of his life to finding the monster and exacting his revenge, and he soon departs to begin his quest.
Victor tracks the monster ever northward into the ice. In a dogsled chase, Victor almost catches up with the monster, but the sea beneath them swells and the ice breaks, leaving an unbridgeable gap between them. At this point, Walton encounters Victor, and the narrative catches up to the time of Walton’s fourth letter to his sister.
Walton tells the remainder of the story in another series of letters to his sister. Victor, already ill when the two men meet, worsens and dies shortly thereafter. When Walton returns, several days later, to the room in which the body lies, he is startled to see the monster weeping over Victor. The monster tells Walton of his immense solitude, suffering, hatred, and remorse. He asserts that now that his creator has died, he too can end his suffering. The monster then departs for the northernmost ice to die."
Saying,"Having Our Say is an oral history conducted by Amy Hill Hearth with the centenarian sisters Sadie and Bessie Delany. The book is divided into a preface and seven parts. In the preface, Hearth describes how the Delanys first charm her when she writes about them for the New York Times and how she eventually convinces them to share their stories in a book. After the preface, Hearth disappears from the narrative. She provides context for the Delanys’ stories at the beginning of each section but otherwise acts strictly as a listener. When the sisters tell a story together, or in an almost identical fashion, Hearth attributes the chapters to them both. When the sisters have distinctive viewpoints or ways of telling a story, Hearth attributes the chapter to either Bessie or Sadie. Though the book’s seven parts generally follow a chronological pattern, the sisters occasionally discuss the present day (the early 1990s). They compare different eras of history; make judgments with their century of experience; and frequently discuss racism, sexism, and aging.
Throughout the stories, the sisters talk about their childhoods in the segregated South, where the “rebby boys,” or racist white men, are a constant menace. The sisters have very different personalities. Sadie is an obedient mama’s child, and Bessie is strong-willed and outspoken. Both sisters are determined and intelligent. The sisters describe their parents, Henry Beard Delany and Nanny James Logan, who grew up during and after the Civil War. Following the “Surrender” came the difficult days of the Reconstruction, when poverty and a struggle for power ruled the South. Henry was born into slavery. When the Surrender came, his family began a free life with nothing. The Delanys were luckier than most Black families because they were together and they could read. Nanny’s family faced discrimination because her father was white and her mother was a quarter Black. Though Nanny appeared white, she was considered “colored,” and her own parents couldn’t marry. Nanny and Henry met at Saint Augustine’s School in Raleigh, North Carolina, and Henry eventually became vice principal of “Saint Aug’s.” The Delany parents had ten children, including Sadie and Bessie.
Sadie and Bessie encounter racism early in life. The Jim Crow laws throughout the South required separate facilities for whites and Black people, and on the trolley to Pullen Park, a driver tells the Delany family to sit in the back. The spring where they drink water at the park is divided, with one side for white people and the other for Black people, and the drugstore where they used to buy limeade will no longer serve them. Despite all the obstacles, all the Delany children plan to go to college. To pay for school, both Sadie and Bessie take jobs as teachers. Sadie is a Jeanes Supervisor, setting up domestic science programs in rural schools, and she takes Booker T. Washington on tours of her school district. Bessie teaches first in rural North Carolina, then in Georgia. In Georgia, she is nearly lynched on her way to her new job when she stands up to a drunken white man in a train station waiting room. Both women date, but their father is critical of their boyfriends, and Nanny tells Bessie that she will have to choose between work and a family.
Sadie moves to Harlem in 1916, and Bessie follows nearly two years later. All the Delany children except Lemuel eventually migrate to Harlem. The Harlem Renaissance, a time of literary experimentation and cutting-edge jazz music, is in full swing. Although they sometimes go to nightclubs and know many famous personalities through their brother Hubert, a New York City political figure, the sisters focus on their careers. Sadie attends Pratt Institute, then Columbia University, where she receives a master’s degree. She becomes the first Black woman to teach domestic science at public high schools in New York City. Bessie studies dentistry at Columbia University and opens a practice in Harlem. She shares an office with her brother Hap, and the place becomes a meeting point for thinkers such as E. Franklin Frazier. Bessie narrowly avoids an encounter with the Ku Klux Klan on Long Island and becomes an outspoken protestor against racial discrimination. The family is devastated when Henry Beard Delany dies in 1928. Nanny moves to Harlem and begins to go on trips with Sadie. The Black community is particularly hard-hit by the Depression, but the Delanys cope.
During World War II, the Delany sisters are concerned with their nephew, Little Hubie. Little Hubie is born “damaged” (which is the extent of the explanation the sisters give for his condition) and dies when he is ten years old. Manross Delany fights in the war and faces discrimination in the U.S. armed forces. Sadie, Bessie, and their mother move to a cottage in the Bronx and enjoy cultivating their own garden. Nanny is too elderly to stay home by herself, so Bessie retires at fifty-nine to take care of her. Before she dies, Nanny meets Eleanor Roosevelt. Around this time, the civil rights movement is underway, and the Jim Crow laws at last begin to unravel. The deaths of their mother and a number of their brothers grieve the sisters. They decide to move to Mount Vernon, a mostly white suburb in New York. At their advanced age, the Delany sisters are part of a quiet revolutionary movement to integrate white suburbs. Sadie and Bessie discuss aging and the fears and fearlessness that accompany that process."
House,"A Doll’s House opens on Christmas Eve. Nora Helmer enters her well-furnished living room—the setting of the entire play—carrying several packages. Torvald Helmer, Nora’s husband, comes out of his study when he hears her arrive. He greets her playfully and affectionately, but then chides her for spending so much money on Christmas gifts. Their conversation reveals that the Helmers have had to be careful with money for many years, but that Torvald has recently obtained a new position at the bank where he works that will afford them a more comfortable lifestyle.
Helene, the maid, announces that the Helmers’ dear friend Dr. Rank has come to visit. At the same time, another visitor has arrived, this one unknown. To Nora’s great surprise, Kristine Linde, a former school friend, comes into the room. The two have not seen each other for years, but Nora mentions having read that Mrs. Linde’s husband passed away a few years earlier. Mrs. Linde tells Nora that when her husband died, she was left with no money and no children. Nora tells Mrs. Linde about her first year of marriage to Torvald. She explains that they were very poor and both had to work long hours. Torvald became sick, she adds, and the couple had to travel to Italy so that Torvald could recover.
Nora inquires further about Mrs. Linde’s life, and Mrs. Linde explains that for years she had to care for her sick mother and her two younger brothers. She states that her mother has passed away, though, and that the brothers are too old to need her. Instead of feeling relief, Mrs. Linde says she feels empty because she has no occupation; she hopes that Torvald may be able to help her obtain employment. Nora promises to speak to Torvald and then reveals a great secret to Mrs. Linde—without Torvald’s knowledge, Nora illegally borrowed money for the trip that she and Torvald took to Italy; she told Torvald that the money had come from her father. For years, Nora reveals, she has worked and saved in secret, slowly repaying the debt, and soon it will be fully repaid.
Krogstad, a low-level employee at the bank where Torvald works, arrives and proceeds into Torvald’s study. Nora reacts uneasily to Krogstad’s presence, and Dr. Rank, coming out of the study, says Krogstad is “morally sick.” Once he has finished meeting with Krogstad, Torvald comes into the living room and says that he can probably hire Mrs. Linde at the bank. Dr. Rank, Torvald, and Mrs. Linde then depart, leaving Nora by herself. Nora’s children return with their nanny, Anne-Marie, and Nora plays with them until she notices Krogstad’s presence in the room. The two converse, and Krogstad is revealed to be the source of Nora’s secret loan.
Krogstad states that Torvald wants to fire him from his position at the bank and alludes to his own poor reputation. He asks Nora to use her influence to ensure that his position remains secure. When she refuses, Krogstad points out that he has in his possession a contract that contains Nora’s forgery of her father’s signature. Krogstad blackmails Nora, threatening to reveal her crime and to bring shame and disgrace on both Nora and her husband if she does not prevent Torvald from firing him. Krogstad leaves, and when Torvald returns, Nora tries to convince him not to fire Krogstad, but Torvald will hear nothing of it. He declares Krogstad an immoral man and states that he feels physically ill in the presence of such people.
Act Two opens on the following day, Christmas. Alone, Nora paces her living room, filled with anxiety. Mrs. Linde arrives and helps sew Nora’s costume for the ball that Nora will be attending at her neighbors’ home the following evening. Nora tells Mrs. Linde that Dr. Rank has a mortal illness that he inherited from his father. Nora’s suspicious behavior leads Mrs. Linde to guess that Dr. Rank is the source of Nora’s loan. Nora denies Mrs. Linde’s charge but refuses to reveal the source of her distress. Torvald arrives, and Nora again begs him to keep Krogstad employed at the bank, but again Torvald refuses. When Nora presses him, he admits that Krogstad’s moral behavior isn’t all that bothers him—he dislikes Krogstad’s overly familiar attitude. Torvald and Nora argue until Torvald sends the maid to deliver Krogstad’s letter of dismissal.
Torvald leaves. Dr. Rank arrives and tells Nora that he knows he is close to death. She attempts to cheer him up and begins to flirt with him. She seems to be preparing to ask him to intervene on her behalf in her struggle with Torvald. Suddenly, Dr. Rank reveals to Nora that he is in love with her. In light of this revelation, Nora refuses to ask Dr. Rank for anything.
Once Dr. Rank leaves, Krogstad arrives and demands an explanation for his dismissal. He wants respectability and has changed the terms of the blackmail: he now insists to Nora not only that he be rehired at the bank but that he be rehired in a higher position. He then puts a letter detailing Nora’s debt and forgery in the Helmers’ letterbox. In a panic, Nora tells Mrs. Linde everything, and Mrs. Linde instructs Nora to delay Torvald from opening the letter as long as possible while she goes to speak with Krogstad. In order to distract Torvald from the letterbox, Nora begins to practice the tarantella she will perform at that evening’s costume party. In her agitated emotional state, she dances wildly and violently, displeasing Torvald. Nora manages to make Torvald promise not to open his mail until after she performs at the party. Mrs. Linde soon returns and says that she has left Krogstad a note but that he will be gone until the following evening.
The next night, as the costume party takes place upstairs, Krogstad meets Mrs. Linde in the Helmers’ living room. Their conversation reveals that the two had once been deeply in love, but Mrs. Linde left Krogstad for a wealthier man who would enable her to support her family. She tells Krogstad that now that she is free of her own familial obligations and wishes to be with Krogstad and care for his children. Krogstad is overjoyed and says he will demand his letter back before Torvald can read it and learn Nora’s secret. Mrs. Linde, however, insists he leave the letter, because she believes both Torvald and Nora will be better off once the truth has been revealed.
Soon after Krogstad’s departure, Nora and Torvald enter, back from the costume ball. After saying goodnight to Mrs. Linde, Torvald tells Nora how desirable she looked as she danced. Dr. Rank, who was also at the party and has come to say goodnight, promptly interrupts Torvald’s advances on Nora. After Dr. Rank leaves, Torvald finds in his letterbox two of Dr. Rank’s visiting cards, each with a black cross above the name. Nora knows Dr. Rank’s cards constitute his announcement that he will soon die, and she informs Torvald of this fact. She then insists that Torvald read Krogstad’s letter.
Torvald reads the letter and is outraged. He calls Nora a hypocrite and a liar and complains that she has ruined his happiness. He declares that she will not be allowed to raise their children. Helene then brings in a letter. Torvald opens it and discovers that Krogstad has returned Nora’s contract (which contains the forged signature). Overjoyed, Torvald attempts to dismiss his past insults, but his harsh words have triggered something in Nora. She declares that despite their eight years of marriage, they do not understand one another. Torvald, Nora asserts, has treated her like a “doll” to be played with and admired. She decides to leave Torvald, declaring that she must “make sense of [her]self and everything around her.” She walks out, slamming the door behind her."
Spread,"Matilda Cook is a fourteen-year-old girl living in Philadelphia in 1793. Matilda’s mother, Lucille, manages the coffeehouse, and they live above the shop with Grandfather, Matilda’s deceased father’s father, who fought in the war. Matilda dreams of one day owning her own shops and traveling to Paris, but for now she helps Mother in the coffeehouse, where she is often berated for being too slow or too lazy. The coffeehouse’s cook, Eliza, is a formerly enslaved Black woman whose husband died before she could buy him his freedom. Matilda and her family also have a serving girl, Polly, who was Matilda’s childhood friend. One day, Polly fails show up at the coffeehouse. Mother goes to see where Polly is and comes back with news that Polly died from a sudden fever. Matilda feels very sad and asks to see Polly’s family or go to her funeral, but Mother doesn’t want Matilda going anywhere near a house that could contain sick people.
As Matilda serves the customers in the coffeehouse, she hears them talking about a new disease spreading around the city, and some believe it is yellow fever. More and more people continue to catch the disease and die. Mother considers sending Matilda to the Ludington family’s farm, where she will be farther away from the disease, but Matilda doesn’t want to leave. However, not long after, Mother becomes ill with the fever and insists that Matilda leave her so that she will not get sick as well. Matilda and Grandfather leave Philadelphia with a farmer and his wife to go to the Ludington farm. Grandfather begins coughing on the journey and blames it on the heat. But when the wagon is stopped by several men who are monitoring who goes in and out of the local town, the men hear Grandfather’s coughing and refuse to let him pass. The farmer leaves Grandfather and Matilda behind on the road several miles outside Philadelphia.
Matilda and Grandfather rest in the shade of a tree while Matilda thinks about what to do next. She gathers water for them to drink at a stream and collects berries for them to eat. Grandfather seems weak and at times disoriented but does not show any signs of yellow fever. After trying to find food from local farmers, Matilda returns to Grandfather and collapses. She wakes up several days later in a hospital and learns that she has yellow fever, but Grandfather does not. He explains that his recent cough was caused by heart problems. While Matilda recovers, a clerk tells her that she should go live at the orphan house since she cannot find Mother, but Grandfather protests, insisting that he’ll take care of Matilda.
Once Matilda is fully recovered, she and Grandfather return to Philadelphia. They find that the city has changed very much since they departed. Many businesses have closed. Empty houses are boarded up to prevent thieves from breaking in. When Grandfather and Matilda return to their coffeehouse, they see that it has been broken into and all of their food and several possessions have been stolen. Matilda finds some food in the withered garden and cares for Grandfather. One night, two men break into the house while Matilda is sleeping on the first floor. Matilda hides, but the men soon realize she’s there. They trap her and try to make her tell them where she’s hidden her money. Woken by the noise, Grandfather comes downstairs with his rifle and shoots. One of the men attacks Grandfather, but Matilda stabs the man in the shoulder with Grandfather’s sword, which the men had planned to steal. The men leave when Matilda threatens to kill them. Grandfather, who was knocked back by the shot of the rifle and who has already been having heart troubles, dies. Matilda brings his body outside to be buried in a mass grave the next day.
On her way home from overseeing Grandfather’s burial, Matilda sees a young girl crying. She learns that the girl’s name is Nell and that Nell’s mother is dead. While trying to find someone to take in Nell, Matilda sees Eliza in the distance and follows her until she catches up. Eliza allows Matilda and Nell to stay with her and her brother Joseph’s family. Matilda becomes attached to Nell but knows she’s not ready to take care of a child, so Matilda brings Nell to the orphan house. However, after the woman at the orphan house says they can’t take in any more children, Matilda brings Nell back to Eliza’s brother’s house, secretly relieved.
Matilda begins helping Eliza with her volunteer work for the Free African Society, caring for patients with yellow fever. One day, Matilda and Eliza return home to find that Joseph’s sons and Nell have the fever. Knowing the children need to get out of the heat to survive, Matilda and Eliza bring the children to the coffeehouse, where it is cooler. The first frost soon arrives, an event that people believe will bring an end to the epidemic. The children eventually recover.
After the epidemic ends, Matilda reopens the coffeehouse with Eliza as her partner and begins spending more time with a local painter’s apprentice, Nathaniel Benson. One day, Nathaniel comes in the coffeehouse to announce that President Washington has returned to Philadelphia. Everyone rushes outside to catch a glimpse of the president. On their way back to the coffeehouse, a carriage arrives and Matilda’s mother steps out. Mother left for the Ludington farm shortly after Matilda and Grandfather did and tried to track them down when she realized they were not there, which only made her weaker. She recovered at the Ludingtons’ and returned to Philadelphia as soon as she could. With Mother needing more rest than before, Matilda continues running the coffeehouse and caring for Nell as the city moves on from the epidemic."
Dear,"Part 1 alternates between the narrative and the letters Justyce McAllister, a black seventeen-year-old boy living in Atlanta, writes to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.—to whom he refers simply as “Martin”—in which he reflects on his life and explains how he tries to live more like Dr. King.
In the middle of the night, Justyce goes to rescue his ex-girlfriend, Melo Taylor, from driving home drunk. When the police arrive, Officer Castillo misreads the situation and puts Justyce in handcuffs using excessive force. Justyce is finally released with the help of Mrs. Friedman, a lawyer and the mother of his friend, Sarah-Jane, or SJ. In a Dear Martin letter, Justyce talks about being from a rough neighborhood, attending Braselton Preparatory Academy on full scholarship, and having plans to attend an Ivy League college. 
The brutal treatment he received from the police reminds Justyce of the recent police shooting of a black seventeen-year-old with a promising future. Hanging out with his best friend Manny Rivers, a wealthy, black Braselton Prep student, the two talk about Justyce’s on-and-off relationship with Melo. Over dinner, they learn that Manny’s cousin, Quan Banks, a gang member from Justyce’s neighborhood, has killed Officer Castillo. In class, Justyce, SJ, and Manny’s friend, Jared Christensen, both of whom are white, debate with their teacher and debate coach Dr. Jarius “Doc” Dray whether racial equality exists in America. Jared claims America is now color-blind.
On the weekend, Justyce goes to a Halloween party with Manny’s friends Jared, Kyle, and Blake. Jared suggests the boys dress as stereotypes. Justyce dresses as a thug and Blake as a Klansman. At the party, one of the Black Jihad, a gang from Justyce’s old neighborhood, punches Blake for his offensive costume and criticizes Manny and Justyce for hanging out with these white boys. Later, SJ and Justyce have a late-night conversation during which Justyce realizes how much he likes SJ. The next day, SJ celebrates Justyce’s acceptance at Yale University. In Doc’s class, Jared complains about affirmative action, claiming that an undeserving black student may have taken his spot at Yale. Later, Manny observes that SJ seems perfect for Justyce, but Justyce says his mother doesn’t want him to date a white girl. Manny confesses to being afraid of black girls because of his lack of exposure to them.
Some weeks later, Justyce and SJ win their debate tournament about racial profiling. Justyce then tries to kiss SJ, but she turns away. Confused, Justyce gets even more upset when he finds out that another black teen has been killed by the police. In reaction to these events, Justyce gets drunk and goes with Manny to Blake’s birthday party. Angered by their displays of racism, Justyce hits Blake and Jared. Justyce worries whites will only ever see his skin color and thinks his experiment to be like Martin Luther King Jr. has failed. 
Later, Doc visits a hungover Justyce in his dorm room. Justyce tells Doc about his alcoholic, abusive father, whom he doesn’t want to be like. Doc encourages Justyce to hold on to his value despite other people’s racism. A couple days later in Justyce’s dorm room, Manny says his eyes are now open to racism. He tells Justyce he has quit the basketball team and that he has hit Jared for a racist comment that Jared made. 
Later, Manny’s dad talks to the boys about the racism he experiences at work and his regret that he hadn’t better prepared Manny for racism. The next weekend, because Manny feels upset by Jared’s dad pressing assault charges against him, he and Justyce drive around, playing music loudly. Manny has an angry exchange about his music volume with a white driver, who turns out to be an off-duty police officer, Garrett Tison. The officer shouts a racial slur and fires three shots that injure Justyce and kill Manny.
In part 2, the narrative is interwoven with news reports. Disillusioned, Justyce stops writing his Dear Martin letters. After being released from the hospital, Justyce attends Manny’s funeral and reconnects with SJ. Newspaper articles follow the Tison case and report that Tison will stand trial for shooting Justyce and Manny. Justyce receives a free car. Manny’s parents give Justyce an heirloom watch in memory of Manny and tell him that Manny’s cousin Quan wants Justyce to visit him in juvenile detention. During Justyce’s visit, Quan explains the Black Man’s Curse and encourages Justyce to seek support from the Black Jihad. The media misrepresent Justyce as a “thug,” which angers SJ. Surprisingly, Jared wants to help correct the misguided impression of Justyce. Doc encourages Justyce to focus on the kind of man he wants to be, and SJ apologizes to Justyce for avoiding him.
Manny’s father is forced to step down from his corporate VP role because of his efforts to get justice for Manny and Justyce, and Manny’s parents decide to move. Feeling alone, Justyce visits the leader of the Black Jihad but decides not to join the gang. Instead, he goes to see SJ, and the two confess their feelings for each other. The news reports arson at Officer Tison’s home. After his graduation, the police question Justyce in connection with the fire because some Black Jihad have named Justyce as an accomplice. But Justyce has an alibi: He was with SJ’s family the night of the fire. 
When Justyce’s mother learns he’s dating a white girl, she becomes upset. At the trial for Manny’s murder, the defense attorney cross-examines Justyce, trying to paint Justyce and Manny as volatile and violent. The jury doesn’t reach a conclusion about the murder charges against Officer Tison. Before there can be a retrial, Tison is murdered in prison. Several weeks later, Justyce and SJ head to college. In a final Dear Martin letter, Justyce talks about being negatively judged by his college roommate. He also reflects on why his be-like-Martin experiment didn’t work. Justyce realizes he needs to figure out who he is and what he believes. Four months later, Justyce reconnects with Jared at Manny’s grave. The two talk about missing Manny, life at Yale, and what they plan to study. It’s clear Jared has changed and that a genuine friendship has begun between the two."
Remnant,"The Remains of the Day is told in the first-person narration of an English butler named Stevens. In July 1956, Stevens decides to take a six- day road trip to the West Country of England—a region to the west of Darlington Hall, the house in which Stevens resides and has worked as a butler for thirty-four years. Though the house was previously owned by the now-deceased Lord Darlington, by 1956, it has come under the ownership of Mr. Farraday, an American gentleman. Stevens likes Mr. Farraday, but fails to interact well with him socially: Stevens is a circumspect, serious person and is not comfortable joking around in the manner Mr. Farraday prefers. Stevens terms this skill of casual conversation ""bantering""; several times throughout the novel Stevens proclaims his desire to improve his bantering skill so that he can better please his current employer.
The purpose of Stevens's road trip is to visit Miss Kenton, the former housekeeper of Darlington Hall who left twenty years earlier to get married. Stevens has received a letter from Miss Kenton, and believes that her letter hints that her marriage is failing and that she might like to return to her post as housekeeper. Ever since World War II has ended, it has been difficult to find enough people to staff large manor houses such as Darlington Hall.
Much of the narrative is comprised of Stevens's memories of his work as a butler during and just after World War II. He describes the large, elaborate dinner parties and elegant, prominent personages who come to dine and stay at Darlington Hall in those times. It is gradually revealed—largely through other characters' interactions with Stevens, rather than his own admissions—that Lord Darlington, due to his mistaken impression of the German agenda prior to World War II, sympathized with the Nazis. Darlington even arranged and hosted dinner parties between the German and British heads of state to help both sides come to a peaceful understanding. Stevens always maintains that Lord Darlington was a perfect gentleman, and that it is a shame his reputation has been soiled simply because he misunderstood the Nazis' true aims.
During the trip Stevens also recounts stories of his contemporaries—butlers in other houses with whom he struck up friendships. Stevens's most notable relationship by far, however, is his long-term working relationship with Miss Kenton. Though Stevens never says so outright, it appears that he harbors repressed romantic feelings for Miss Kenton. Despite the fact that the two frequently disagree over various household affairs when they work together, the disagreements are childish in nature and mainly serve to illustrate the fact that the two care for each other. At the end of the novel, Miss Kenton admits to Stevens that her life may have turned out better if she had married him. After hearing these words, Stevens is extremely upset. However, he does not tell Miss Kenton—whose married name is Mrs. Benn—how he feels. Stevens and Miss Kenton part, and Stevens returns to Darlington Hall, his only new resolve being to perfect the art of bantering to please his new employer.
As Salman Rushdie comments, The Remains of the Day is ""a story both beautiful and cruel."" It is a story primarily about regret: throughout his life, Stevens puts his absolute trust and devotion in a man who makes drastic mistakes. In the totality of his professional commitment, Stevens fails to pursue the one woman with whom he could have had a fulfilling and loving relationship. His prim mask of formality cuts him off from intimacy, companionship, and understanding."
Distresses,"In the Time of The Butterflies, by Julia Alvarez, is a work of historical fiction based on the true story of the four Mirabal sisters who fought for freedom from the dictatorship of Rafael Trujillo in the mid to late 20th century Dominican Republic. Three of the sisters, Patria, Mariá Teresa, and Minerva, tell their story in first person narration. The fourth sister’s story, Dedé’s, is told by a third person omniscient narrator. 
Part 1 begins in 1994 with Dedé, now an older woman, living in her childhood home. She agrees to an interview request at the family home. 
The interviewer arrives and Dedé explains that Minerva, a year younger than herself, was always concerned with right and wrong. Patria, a year older than Dedé, was the religious one. And Mariá Teresa, nine years younger than Minerva, was twenty-five when she died. Dede recalls a happier moment, the moment she calls “zero.” The family sits under the anacahuita tree while Papá plays fortune teller about his daughters’ futures. The subject of Trujillo comes up, and everyone goes silent. Spies are everywhere.
Minerva begins her story with how she persuades Papá to allow his three eldest daughters to attend the convent school, Inmaculada Concepción. There she meets Sinita and learns about Trujillo’s corruption and brutality. Lina Lovatón, a student at the school, is one of Trujillo’s many girlfriends. Lina becomes pregnant and is sent to Miami to live in exile. 
Minerva and her friends perform a skit in front of Trujillo to celebrate the country’s centennial. The performance goes awry when Sinita, off script, approaches Trujillo to stab him with an arrow. To make it seem as if the performance had been planned that way, Minerva shouts, ""¡Viva Trujillo!""  
We learn Mariá Teresa’s story through her diary entries. Minerva has been sneaking out of school to attend secret meetings of those opposed to Trujillo. When Trujillo’s men arrest a member of Minerva’s dissident group, Minerva buries all evidence of her involvement.
Patria is a spiritual soul. She struggles between spiritual and earthly desires. She meets Pedrito Gonzalez, falls in love, marries, and has two children. Pregnant a third time, she suffers a miscarriage, and wonders if God is punishing her for not becoming a nun. While on a retreat with Mamá, she learns that Papá has been unfaithful. 
As Part 2 begins, Dedé tells the interviewer about Virgilio Morales, or Lío, a special friend of Minerva’s and member of the resistance. Before he goes into hiding, Lío gives Dedé a letter for Minerva asking her to join him in exile. Dedé reads Lío’s letter and burns it instead of giving it to Minerva.
Minerva discovers that Papá has a mistress, Carmen, and four children by her. She finds letters from Lío that Papá has hidden. Lío wonders why Minerva hasn’t responded to his request that she join him. Minerva confronts her father about his other family and Lío, and she tells him she owes him no respect. 
The family attends one of Trujillo’s parties, and he suspects that Minerva is conspiring with Virgilio Morales (Lío). He dances obscenely with her, and she slaps him in the face. The family makes a quick exit, and for the infraction of leaving the party before Trujillo, Papá is taken in for questioning, and Minerva is interrogated. It takes weeks for Minerva and Mamá to secure Papá’s release.
Mariá Teresa’s next series of diary entries opens with the funeral of Papá. It distresses her that his other family came to the cemetery, and she decides she hates men. She reports that Minerva has met someone special, Manolo.
Mariá Teresa graduates. Minerva and Manolo have married, have a daughter, Minou, and are part of the national underground that has spread across the country. Minerva’s code name is Mariposa (butterfly). Mariá Teresa joins them as Mariposa (#2). She and Leandro, a member of the resistance, fall in love and are married.
Patria, now married eighteen years, is pregnant with Raul Ernesto. She cares for Minou, Minerva’s daughter, while Minerva travels for the resistance. After surviving a government bombing, Patria (Mariposa #3) and Pedrito join the resistance, and their home becomes the “motherhouse of the movement.”
In Part 3, Dedé’s interview ends and Minou arrives and asks why Dedé didn’t join her sisters in the resistance, and Dedé tells the story: 
One day, Dedé’s sisters arrive, wanting her to bury boxes in the cacao field on the property. Jaimito, Dedé’s husband, says no. A week later, the secret police arrest Leandro, as well as Pedrito, Nelson, and Manolo. A few days later, the secret police arrest Minerva and Mariá Teresa. Rumors spread that Trujillo wants Minerva killed. 
After Minerva and Mariá Teresa are released from prison, Dedé receives notes advising her to tell the butterflies to avoid the roads to Puerto Plata, where the men have been transferred. 
When we rejoin Patria’s story, Pedrito is in prison. Margarita Mirabal, Papá’s daughter by Carmen, visits Patria. She is able to smuggle notes out and supplies into the prison for Mariá Teresa and Minerva. Eventually, Patria, Mamá, and Dedé are given passes to visit the sisters. Nelson, because he is a minor, is released.
Mariá Teresa’s diary describes prison life: their cell, the routine, her friendships, her daydreams about Jacqui, her daughter, and the horrendous torture she endured. 
Minerva explains that she is home, and on house arrest. The sisters make weekly prison visits to see their husbands. Dedé worries about their safety, for news spreads that Trujillo has two problems, “the damn church and the Mirabal sisters.” 
Officials transfer Manolo and Leandro to Puerto Plata, a shorter drive but over a mountain pass. On the sisters’ last trip to the prison, lights are on in one of Trujillo’s abandoned mansions along the pass. Thoughts of ambush cross the sisters’ minds, but they decide to return home that same evening.
In the Epilogue, Dedé’s story switches to first person narration. Her sisters are dead. People who encountered her sisters on that last day help her piece together what happened. Men confess to killing them, and to pushing their Jeep over the cliff. The revolution continues, Trujillo is assassinated, and the new president promises to rebuild the nation. But there is a coup, and Manolo dies fighting yet another revolution. Dedé must tell Minou that her father is dead. 
In 1994, Dedé is the oracle of the Mirabal story. Telling the story helps her understand. Dedé and Jaimito divorce, and Dedé survives breast cancer. Once again the winner of the prize trip at work, she’ll go to Canada this year, to find the man she had met last year in Barcelona. To find love."
1873,"Beloved begins in 1873 in Cincinnati, Ohio, where Sethe, a former slave, has been living with her eighteen-year-old daughter Denver. Sethe’s mother-in-law, Baby Suggs, lived with them until her death eight years earlier. Just before Baby Suggs’s death, Sethe’s two sons, Howard and Buglar, ran away. Sethe believes they fled because of the malevolent presence of an abusive ghost that has haunted their house at 124 Bluestone Road for years. Denver, however, likes the ghost, which everyone believes to be the spirit of her dead sister.
On the day the novel begins, Paul D, whom Sethe has not seen since they worked together on Mr. Garner’s Sweet Home plantation in Kentucky approximately twenty years earlier, stops by Sethe’s house. His presence resurrects memories that have lain buried in Sethe’s mind for almost two decades. From this point on, the story will unfold on two temporal planes. The present in Cincinnati constitutes one plane, while a series of events that took place around twenty years earlier, mostly in Kentucky, constitutes the other. This latter plane is accessed and described through the fragmented flashbacks of the major characters. Accordingly, we frequently read these flashbacks several times, sometimes from varying perspectives, with each successive narration of an event adding a little more information to the previous ones.
From these fragmented memories, the following story begins to emerge: Sethe, the protagonist, was born in the South to an African mother she never knew. When she is thirteen, she is sold to the Garners, who own Sweet Home and practice a comparatively benevolent kind of slavery. There, the other slaves, who are all men, lust after her but never touch her. Their names are Sixo, Paul D, Paul A, Paul F, and Halle. Sethe chooses to marry Halle, apparently in part because he has proven generous enough to buy his mother’s freedom by hiring himself out on the weekends. Together, Sethe and Halle have two sons, Howard and Buglar, as well as a baby daughter whose name we never learn. When she leaves Sweet Home, Sethe is also pregnant with a fourth child. After the eventual death of the proprietor, Mr. Garner, the widowed Mrs. Garner asks her sadistic, vehemently racist brother-in-law to help her run the farm. He is known to the slaves as schoolteacher, and his oppressive presence makes life on the plantation even more unbearable than it had been before. The slaves decide to run.
Schoolteacher and his nephews anticipate the slaves’ escape, however, and capture Paul D and Sixo. Schoolteacher kills Sixo and brings Paul D back to Sweet Home, where Paul D sees Sethe for what he believes will be the last time. She is still intent on running, having already sent her children ahead to her mother-in-law Baby Suggs’s house in Cincinnati. Invigorated by the recent capture, schoolteacher’s nephews seize Sethe in the barn and violate her, stealing the milk her body is storing for her infant daughter. Unbeknownst to Sethe, Halle is watching the event from a loft above her, where he lies frozen with horror. Afterward, Halle goes mad: Paul D sees him sitting by a churn with butter slathered all over his face. Paul D, meanwhile, is forced to suffer the indignity of wearing an iron bit in his mouth.
When schoolteacher finds out that Sethe has reported his and his nephews’ misdeeds to Mrs. Garner, he has her whipped severely, despite the fact that she is pregnant. Swollen and scarred, Sethe nevertheless runs away, but along the way she collapses from exhaustion in a forest. A white girl, Amy Denver, finds her and nurses her back to health. When Amy later helps Sethe deliver her baby in a boat, Sethe names this second daughter Denver after the girl who helped her. Sethe receives further help from Stamp Paid, who rows her across the Ohio River to Baby Suggs’s house. Baby Suggs cleans Sethe up before allowing her to see her three older children.
Sethe spends twenty-eight wonderful days in Cincinnati, where Baby Suggs serves as an unofficial preacher to the black community. On the last day, however, schoolteacher comes for Sethe to take her and her children back to Sweet Home. Rather than surrender her children to a life of dehumanizing slavery, she flees with them to the woodshed and tries to kill them. Only the third child, her older daughter, dies, her throat having been cut with a handsaw by Sethe. Sethe later arranges for the baby’s headstone to be carved with the word “Beloved.” The sheriff takes Sethe and Denver to jail, but a group of white abolitionists, led by the Bodwins, fights for her release. Sethe returns to the house at 124, where Baby Suggs has sunk into a deep depression. The community shuns the house, and the family continues to live in isolation.
Meanwhile, Paul D has endured torturous experiences in a chain gang in Georgia, where he was sent after trying to kill Brandywine, a slave owner to whom he was sold by schoolteacher. His traumatic experiences have caused him to lock away his memories, emotions, and ability to love in the “tin tobacco box” of his heart. One day, a fortuitous rainstorm allows Paul D and the other chain gang members to escape. He travels northward by following the blossoming spring flowers. Years later, he ends up on Sethe’s porch in Cincinnati.
Paul D’s arrival at 124 commences the series of events taking place in the present time frame. Prior to moving in, Paul D chases the house’s resident ghost away, which makes the already lonely Denver resent him from the start. Sethe and Paul D look forward to a promising future together, until one day, on their way home from a carnival, they encounter a strange young woman sleeping near the steps of 124. Most of the characters believe that the woman—who calls herself Beloved—is the embodied spirit of Sethe’s dead daughter, and the novel provides a wealth of evidence supporting this interpretation. Denver develops an obsessive attachment to Beloved, and Beloved’s attachment to Sethe is equally if not more intense. Paul D and Beloved hate each other, and Beloved controls Paul D by moving him around the house like a rag doll and by seducing him against his will.
When Paul D learns the story of Sethe’s “rough choice”—her infanticide—he leaves 124 and begins sleeping in the basement of the local church. In his absence, Sethe and Beloved’s relationship becomes more intense and exclusive. Beloved grows increasingly abusive, manipulative, and parasitic, and Sethe is obsessed with satisfying Beloved’s demands and making her understand why she murdered her. Worried by the way her mother is wasting away, Denver leaves the premises of 124 for the first time in twelve years in order to seek help from Lady Jones, her former teacher. The community provides the family with food and eventually organizes under the leadership of Ella, a woman who had worked on the Underground Railroad and helped with Sethe’s escape, in order to exorcise Beloved from 124. When they arrive at Sethe’s house, they see Sethe on the porch with Beloved, who stands smiling at them, naked and pregnant. Mr. Bodwin, who has come to 124 to take Denver to her new job, arrives at the house. Mistaking him for schoolteacher, Sethe runs at Mr. Bodwin with an ice pick. She is restrained, but in the confusion Beloved disappears, never to return.
Afterward, Paul D comes back to Sethe, who has retreated to Baby Suggs’s bed to die. Mourning Beloved, Sethe laments, “She was my best thing.” But Paul D replies, “You your best thing, Sethe.” The novel then ends with a warning that “[t]his is not a story to pass on.” The town, and even the residents of 124, have forgotten Beloved “[l]ike an unpleasant dream during a troubling sleep.”"
Valuable,"Scout Finch lives with her brother, Jem, and their widowed father, Atticus, in the sleepy Alabama town of Maycomb. Maycomb is suffering through the Great Depression, but Atticus is a prominent lawyer and the Finch family is reasonably well off in comparison to the rest of society. One summer, Jem and Scout befriend a boy named Dill, who has come to live in their neighborhood for the summer, and the trio acts out stories together. Eventually, Dill becomes fascinated with the spooky house on their street called the Radley Place. The house is owned by Mr. Nathan Radley, whose brother, Arthur (nicknamed Boo), has lived there for years without venturing outside.
Scout goes to school for the first time that fall and detests it. She and Jem find gifts apparently left for them in a knothole of a tree on the Radley property. Dill returns the following summer, and he, Scout, and Jem begin to act out the story of Boo Radley. Atticus puts a stop to their antics, urging the children to try to see life from another person’s perspective before making judgments. But, on Dill’s last night in Maycomb for the summer, the three sneak onto the Radley property, where Nathan Radley shoots at them. Jem loses his pants in the ensuing escape. When he returns for them, he finds them mended and hung over the fence.
The next winter, Jem and Scout find more presents in the tree, presumably left by the mysterious Boo. Nathan Radley eventually plugs the knothole with cement. Shortly thereafter, a fire breaks out in another neighbor’s house, and during the fire someone slips a blanket on Scout’s shoulders as she watches the blaze. Convinced that Boo did it, Jem tells Atticus about the mended pants and the presents.
To the consternation of Maycomb’s racist white community, Atticus agrees to defend a Black man named Tom Robinson, who has been accused of raping a white woman. Because of Atticus’s decision, Jem and Scout are subjected to abuse from other children, even when they celebrate Christmas at the family compound on Finch’s Landing. Calpurnia, the Finches’ Black cook, takes them to the local Black church, where the warm and close-knit community largely embraces the children.
Atticus’s sister, Alexandra, comes to live with the Finches the next summer. Dill, who is supposed to live with his “new father” in another town, runs away and comes to Maycomb. Tom Robinson’s trial begins, and when the accused man is placed in the local jail, a mob gathers to lynch him. Atticus faces the mob down the night before the trial. Jem and Scout, who have sneaked out of the house, soon join him. Scout recognizes one of the men, and her polite questioning about his son shames him into dispersing the mob.
At the trial itself, the children sit in the “colored balcony” with the town’s Black citizens. Atticus provides clear evidence that the accusers, Mayella Ewell and her father, Bob, are lying: in fact, Mayella propositioned Tom Robinson, was caught by her father, and then accused Tom of rape to cover her shame and guilt. Atticus provides impressive evidence that the marks on Mayella’s face are from wounds that her father inflicted; upon discovering her with Tom, he called her a whore and beat her. Yet, despite the significant evidence pointing to Tom’s innocence, the all-white jury convicts him. The innocent Tom later tries to escape from prison and is shot to death. In the aftermath of the trial, Jem’s faith in justice is badly shaken, and he lapses into despondency and doubt.
Despite the verdict, Bob Ewell feels that Atticus and the judge have made a fool out of him, and he vows revenge. He menaces Tom Robinson’s widow, tries to break into the judge’s house, and finally attacks Jem and Scout as they walk home from a Halloween party. Boo Radley intervenes, however, saving the children and stabbing Ewell fatally during the struggle. Boo carries the wounded Jem back to Atticus’s house, where the sheriff, in order to protect Boo, insists that Ewell tripped over a tree root and fell on his own knife. After sitting with Scout for a while, Boo disappears once more into the Radley house.  
Later, Scout feels as though she can finally imagine what life is like for Boo. He has become a human being to her at last. With this realization, Scout embraces her father’s advice to practice sympathy and understanding and demonstrates that her experiences with hatred and prejudice will not sully her faith in human goodness."
Mortgage,"A Raisin in the Sun portrays a few weeks in the life of the Youngers, a Black family living on the South Side of Chicago in the 1950s. When the play opens, the Youngers are about to receive an insurance check for $10,000. This money comes from the deceased Mr. Younger’s life insurance policy. Each of the adult members of the family has an idea as to what he or she would like to do with this money. The matriarch of the family, Mama, wants to buy a house to fulfill a dream she shared with her husband. Mama’s son, Walter Lee, would rather use the money to invest in a liquor store with his friends. He believes that the investment will solve the family’s financial problems forever. Walter’s wife, Ruth, agrees with Mama, however, and hopes that she and Walter can provide more space and opportunity for their son, Travis. Finally, Beneatha, Walter’s sister and Mama’s daughter, wants to use the money for her medical school tuition. She also wishes that her family members were not so interested in assimilating into the white world. Beneatha instead tries to find her identity by looking back to the past and to Africa.
As the play progresses, the Youngers clash over their competing dreams. Ruth discovers that she is pregnant but fears that if she has the child, she will put more financial pressure on her family members. When Walter says nothing to Ruth’s admission that she is considering abortion, Mama puts a down payment on a house for the whole family. She believes that a bigger, brighter dwelling will help them all. This house is in Clybourne Park, an entirely white neighborhood. When the Youngers’ future neighbors find out that the Youngers are moving in, they send Mr. Lindner, from the Clybourne Park Improvement Association, to offer the Youngers money in return for staying away. The Youngers refuse the deal, even after Walter loses the rest of the money ($6,500) to his friend Willy Harris, who persuades Walter to invest in the liquor store and then runs off with his cash.
In the meantime, Beneatha rejects her suitor, George Murchison, whom she believes to be shallow and blind to the problems of race. Subsequently, she receives a marriage proposal from her Nigerian boyfriend, Joseph Asagai, who wants Beneatha to get a medical degree and move to Africa with him (Beneatha does not make her choice before the end of the play). The Youngers eventually move out of the apartment, fulfilling the family’s long-held dream. Their future seems uncertain and slightly dangerous, but they are optimistic and determined to live a better life. They believe that they can succeed if they stick together as a family and resolve to defer their dreams no longer."
Type,"After being out to sea for six months without seeing land, the whaling ship The Dolly stops in the Marquesas Islands located in the South Pacific. Tired of a life of drudgery and abuse on board, the narrator, later called Tommo, decides to flee the ship with a fellow shipmate, Toby. The two men plan to hide on the island of Nukuheva, eating tropical fruits until they can catch a ride on a better boat. They must be careful while hiding, though, since the island is partially populated by the Typees, a violent tribe known for being cannibals.
The two men make their escape while the crew is on shore leave. After spending several cold and wet nights on the island mountain, Tommo and Toby spot a beautiful valley below. They are hungry, cold, and Tommo also feels feverish due to an injury to his leg. They decide to descend into the valley even though they are not sure if it is the home of the friendly Happar tribe or that of the dreaded Typee. After a dangerous descent, which involves scaling a steep ravine and jumping onto a tree from a cliff above, the two men are in the heart of the valley. They spot a tree of tropical fruit and then a young native man and woman.
Because of their desperation, they approach the natives and offer them a piece of calico cloth. Initially, Toby and Tommo happily think that the natives are Happars, not Typees. After arriving in their nearby village however, a stern chief, Mehevi, asks Tommo, ""Typee"" or ""Happar""? Knowing that he must choose correctly, Tommo suddenly changes his mind and says ""Typee."" His guess is right and the surrounding natives start chattering happily. The Typees offer Tommo and Toby food and a place to sleep. Mehevi orders a man named Kory-Kory to be Tommo's servant. Tommo immediately feels deeply attracted to a beautiful maiden named Fayaway.
In their initial days with the Typees, Tommo quickly learns to enjoy the pleasures of their lifestyle. Kory-Kory feeds Tommo by hand, carries him everywhere due to his injured leg, and bathes him each morning in the nearby stream. Despite the Typees's hospitality though, neither Toby nor Tommo is entirely free from their fear about cannibalism. When they are served meat for the first time, Toby instantly declares that it is roast human baby and refuses to eat it. Tommo later discovers that it is actually roast pork, but he still remains apprehensive that the Typees plan to do him harm.
Tommo's leg injury also continues to be painful and crippling. Eventually, Toby starts for Nukuheva to get Tommo some European medicine, but has to turn back after an altercation with nearby Happars. Soon after, some foreign ships appear in the Typee Bay and Toby goes with the Typees to greet them. He never returns and Tommo is given only inconclusive answers about where he went. Tommo occasionally worries that the Typees killed and ate Toby, since he has no other explanation.
With time though, Tommo begins to relax and truly enjoy Typee life. As he does so, his leg heals. He spends his days walking with Fayaway or Kory-Kory. He bathes in the morning with a group of half-dressed maidens, sleeps much of the day, and chats with Mehevi at the Ti, a religious location reserved only for men. Tommo describes the Typee culture in depth, including their religious, marital, and social practices. He believes that the Typees are more civilized than Europeans and Americans, even though the latter call natives ""savages."" Actually, Tommo finds that natives live with more honesty, truth, and goodness than Europeans. Their one major flaw is that they sometimes act as cannibals, but many European cultures have engaged in comparably brutal acts, Tommo notes.
Despite Tommo's happiness, he still worries about the Typees's intentions towards him. When the Typees express a desire to tattoo him, Tommo becomes terribly distressed at the thought and it is only through extensive begging that the tattooing is not enforced. The pressure to be tattooed hastens Tommo's desire to escape. This desire is reinforced when Tommo sees the natives holding three shrunken human heads, one of which belongs to a white man. Soon after, Tommo positively learns that the Typees are cannibals. After a battle with the Happars, a feast is held from which Tommo is carefully excluded. Later, though, he sees part of a half-eaten body and knows that the Typees ate the dead Happars. He then thinks about escape constantly.
Tommo's escape comes when a Nukuheva native, Karakoee, comes to the Typee Bay trying to buy Tommo's freedom for an Australian whaling captain. When the natives are not paying close attention, Tommo leaps towards Karakoee and they start rowing away. Several native men swim after them in an effort to overturn their boat, but Tommo disables one of the ferocious chiefs, Mow-Mow, with a forceful blow. Tommo and Karakoee make their escape. When he knows he is free, Tommo faints. Later, however, he entertains his new crew on the Australian ship with tales of his adventures.
In the sequel ""The Story of Toby,"" Toby's mysterious disappearance is explained. He disappeared when a European resident of Nukuheva, Jimmy, arrived and negotiated for his freedom. Toby believed that Jimmy truly wanted to help him, but Jimmy actually was simply working for a whaling ship in need of a crew. After they reached Nukuheva, Toby learned that no one would go back for Tommo as they had promised. He was forced to leave on the ship. Until the publication of Typee, he had believed that his friend, the narrator, was dead."
Federative,"Warriors Don’t Cry begins when Melba and eight other Black men and women in their forties return to their home state of Arkansas to meet the then-governor, Bill Clinton. Melba, the narrator and author, explains that the group, called the Little Rock Nine, is visiting Central High School in Little Rock. As teenagers in 1957, the nine of them were the first Black students to be integrated into the school.
When Melba is twelve years old, the Supreme Court rules that separate schools for whites are illegal, a ruling called Brown v. the Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas. In the year after the ruling, Melba sees very little change in segregation. She is still at an all-Black high school, but she and sixteen other Black students sign up to attend the white school.
Because of the threat of violence, the number of Black students who will participate in the integration is decreased from seventeen to nine. Several times in the few days before school is supposed to start, lawsuits are filed that threaten to stop the nine students. Arkansas Governor Faubus declares that he is going to send the state National Guard to the high school, though he does not say whether they are there to protect the nine or to stop them from entering the school. Grandma India begins to stay awake at night with a shotgun near her. Finally, a few days after school has started, federal court judge Ronald Davies orders that the students be allowed to attend.
On September 3, 1957, Melba and her mother drive to Central High School for Melba’s first day of class. A huge white mob has gathered, and the Arkansas National Guard encircles the school. Luckily, both Melba and her mother make it to the car and escape unharmed. Melba is not allowed to leave her house or answer the door or the phone. She tells her grandmother that she wants to go back to Horace Mann, her old high school, but her grandmother insists that Melba is not a quitter.
President Eisenhower and Governor Faubus meet and attempt to resolve the problem of integration in Arkansas, but the meeting is unsuccessful, and on September 20, 1957, the State of Arkansas goes to federal court before Judge Davies. Judge Davies rules that the Arkansas National Guard must be removed and that the Little Rock Nine must be allowed into Central High School. Governor Faubus removes the guard and predicts that blood will run in the streets of Little Rock if the schools are integrated.
On Monday, September 23, 1957, Melba and the other Black students go to school. They are again greeted by a mob of angry white people. In the middle of one class, Melba is forced to flee to the principal’s office, as the mob has broken the barricades and is headed for the school. Someone in the principal’s office proposes that they give the crowd one of the children to kill so the others can escape. Gene Smith, the assistant chief of police, smuggles the nine students out of the school. The day after the mob attack, Melba stays home and reads that President Eisenhower has announced he will use force to prevent this kind of mob rule and to enforce federal law. The next day, the 101st Airborne Division (a division of war heroes) arrives in Little Rock.
Each Black student has his or her own escort from the 101st Airborne Division. Melba’s solider, Danny, protects her when someone attempts to throw acid in her eyes. In October, Melba, Ernie, and Minnijean meet with some of Central High’s white students under the guidance of a Norwegian reporter, Mrs. Jorumn Rickets, who hopes to foster some sort of understanding between the two groups. The meeting is a failure. Eisenhower withdraws the 101st Airborne, and the nine students are forced to rely on the Arkansas National Guard for protection. The Nine continue to be terrorized: one day, white girls attack Melba in the showers and hold her under scalding water. At the same time, the newspaper that Mrs. Bates (the President of the NAACP in Little Rock) runs is being financially ruined by white businesspeople, and the State Attorney is threatening NAACP officials across the state.
On December 17th, white boys surround Minnijean in the school cafeteria. Minnijean throws hot chili on two of the boys. Minnijean is suspended. The segregationists start a new chant: “One n***** down and eight to go.” Minnijean is allowed to return to school, and a short while later, a white boy pours a bucket of soup on her head. Later, the boy who poured soup on Minnijean attacks her, and a fight ensues. Nobody knows exactly what happened, but the white students allege that Minnijean fought back. Minnijean is expelled from Central High School, and three white students are suspended. The NAACP arranges for a scholarship for Minnijean at a high school in New York.
One day, Melba is almost surrounded by a group of white boys led by Andy, her main tormentor. She is saved by a white boy named Link, who gives her the keys to his car. That night, Melba returns Link’s car to him, and he begins to warn her of the plans that the segregationists have made for her. Melba and Link become friends. On April 16, Judge Davies is removed from the Little Rock integration lawsuits and replaced by an Arkansas judge named Harry Lemley.
One Saturday morning, Link and Melba visit Nana Healey, Link’s Black nanny. Link thinks that Nana Healey has tuberculosis. Melba finds a doctor in the Black community to tend to her. Nana Healey is dying, and Melba has to tell Link. Meanwhile, the integration case is reopened, with Judge Lemley presiding, and the school board once again asks for a postponement of integration at Central High School. Melba’s mother, Lois, is nearly fired from her teaching job of fourteen years because Melba won’t withdraw from Central High School. The end of the school year is approaching, and the segregationists are desperate to keep Ernie, the oldest of the nine, from graduating. Yet, on May 27, Ernie graduates. The next day, Link calls in tears. Nana Healey has died. Link asks Melba to leave Little Rock with him. Melba agrees to go, knowing she will not follow through with her promise.
By May 29, the Nine (including Minnijean) have begun a tour of the northern states, where they are treated like heroes and celebrities. Meanwhile, the integration effort in Little Rock is disintegrating. Judge Lemley grants the school board’s plea to delay integration for three years. The NAACP sets up a round of appeals, and by September of 1958, the students are gearing up for their second year at Central. Rather than allow that to happen, Governor Faubus shuts down all of Little Rock’s high schools. While Melba is waiting to return to school, Grandma India is diagnosed with leukemia and dies in October of 1958. By September of 1959, the NAACP has decided that the strain on the families is too great. They ask people in NAACP chapters across the country to take in the students. Melba is sent to Santa Rosa, California, to the home of the McCabes, a white Quaker family. The McCabes nurture and care for Melba and convince her to go to college in January of 1960.
In September of 1960, Central is again open to integration, but only two of the nine students are readmitted. They eventually graduate. Melba begins to attend San Francisco State University with predominantly white students. One night in 1962, while she is at school, a white soldier named John comes to her room to meet her roommate. There is mutual attraction, and soon they are engaged to be married. Melba relates how she keeps in touch with Link during this time. But when Link hears that she is getting married, and to a white man, he is furious, as Melba had always maintained she could not date a white man. They never speak again. Six months later, Melba and John are married. They have a daughter named Kelli. Seven years after their daughter’s birth, they split up because Melba wants to be a reporter and work, and John wants a housewife. Melba goes to journalism school at Columbia and becomes a reporter. She ends the book by saying that if her experience at Central High School has taught her anything, it is that we are all one."
Blow,"Alex Claremont-Diaz is the 21-year-old son of Ellen Claremont, the first female president of the United States. Alex is highly ambitious, with his sights set on a career in politics like his mother and his father, who is a US senator. Alex is finishing his last year of college and living in the White House with his family, including his older sister June. As the novel opens, June and Alex discuss the British royal wedding, which they are about to attend, and Alex talks about how much he hates the groom’s younger brother, Prince Henry. When Alex was 12, he used to look repeatedly at a photo of Henry from one of June’s teen magazines. But when he met Henry in person, Henry was rude to him, and he’s disliked Henry ever since. At the wedding, Alex is focused on Prince Henry and is irritated by everything he does, especially when he asks June to dance for a photo opportunity. Drunk, Alex confronts Henry for acting superior, and the two end up in a physical altercation that topples the $75,000 royal wedding cake. The international incident is a scandal, and Alex is forced to pretend to be Henry’s close friend to squash rumors of a shaky relationship between the United States and Britain. 
Alex has no choice but to go along with the plan. As Alex and Henry spend more time together, however, Alex is continually surprised by Henry and finds that Henry is not at all what he expected. He’s especially moved when he sees Henry speaking warmly and openly to a young girl with cancer. Before Alex can talk to Henry about it, there’s a loud noise like gunshots, and the two are rushed into a supply closet by security. In the closet, Henry ends up apologizing for mistreating Alex in the past and says he was cold to Alex because his father had just died. Alex and Henry exchange phone numbers and start texting and talking on the phone. The Claremont-Diaz clan has a family dinner, and Ellen offers both Alex and June positions in her reelection campaign. Alex is thrilled, but June, who wants to be a journalist, declines the offer. 
Alex, June, and their best friend Nora, who is the granddaughter of the Vice President, throw their annual New Year’s Eve party. Henry attends with his best friend Pez, who is enamored of June. Everyone is having fun together, but when Henry sees Alex and Nora kiss at midnight, he gets jealous and leaves the party. Alex finds him in the garden, and Henry kisses him for the first time. This spurs a crisis of sexual identity in Alex, who can’t stop thinking about the kiss. Though Alex has had a sexual relationship with his high school friend Liam and been attracted to men, he’s never considered himself bisexual. He talks to Nora about his confusion, and she says that Henry is gay, and that Alex seems to have feelings for Henry. When Henry flies in for a dinner, Alex kisses him while a security guard keeps watch. That night, they have sex for the first time, and Alex says they are friends with benefits. Henry and Alex continue to meet up to have sex when they can get away. They also begin to write flirtatious emails to each other and have heart-to-hearts on the phone. After a night on the town with June, Nora, Henry, Pez, and Henry’s sister Bea, Alex begins to develop feelings for Henry. 
Since Alex's mother is running for reelection and because Henry is a royal, it’s crucial that Henry and Alex’s relationship remain a secret. Alex often turns to his mentor and family friend, Senator Rafael Luna, for advice to help his mother with her campaign. It’s a blow to the whole family when Luna comes out as the running mate for Ellen’s opponent, Jeffrey Richards. Alex is devastated, and Henry comes to visit Alex at the Democratic National Convention to comfort him. The next morning, Zahra, Ellen’s chief of staff and family friend, catches Henry and Alex together and agrees to keep it a secret until after the convention. Alex comes out to his mother, who creates a PowerPoint presentation as a means of talking about the dangers of his relationship with Henry. She tells him she’ll support him, but he needs to be sure the relationship is forever. He goes to his family’s lake house with Henry, June, Nora, and his father Oscar. Alex comes out to his father, too, and he realizes that he is in love with Henry. Just as he’s about to tell Henry how he feels, Henry suddenly becomes formal and fake and leaves the conversation. The next morning Henry leaves the lake house without saying goodbye, leaving only a note. 
When Henry stops responding to Alex’s texts, Alex is distraught. He flies to London to confront Henry. Henry says he can’t be in a relationship with Alex because of the royal family. They have sex, and neither of them is sure whether it is a goodbye or the beginning of their relationship. Henry gives Alex his signet ring and says he wants to be with Alex. They are happy to be together, and they send each other passionate emails when they are apart.
Suspicions about their relationship start coming out in the press, so Alex and Henry pretend to go on dates with Nora and June. It’s painful for Henry to pretend to be someone he isn’t. Then, Akex and Henry's relationship is leaked to the press, with photos of them together and their entire email history. They are both forced to go on a communication blackout, and Ellen’s team attempts to triage the situation. Alex is miserable and worried about Henry. Eventually, he flies to London. Alex and Bea help Henry confront his family, including his grandmother, the Queen. As the Queen argues that the world will never accept them, a group of people gathers outside the palace to express support for Alex and Henry’s love.  
Nora, who has been missing since the news of Alex and Henry’s relationship broke, emerges and reveals that it was the Richards campaign that leaked their photographs and emails. Alex figures out that it was Luna who tipped them off. Alex talks to Luna, and Luna reveals that Richards sexually assaulted him when he was his intern. Luna joined the campaign to expose Richards as a sexual predator. Election night is tense, and in the end, whoever wins Texas, Ellen’s home state, will win the election. Ellen wins, and Henry joins Alex onstage for her victory lap. The two leave the party and go to Alex’s house. Alex shows Henry where he grew up, letting them in with the key he always wears around his neck."
Historical,"In 1983, Richard Papen transfers from a college in his hometown of Plano, California, to Hampden College in Vermont, taken in by the beautiful scenery in a brochure. After experiencing some pushback, Richard is accepted into an exclusive ancient Greek program taught by Professor Julian Morrow, with five other students, Henry, Bunny, Francis, and twins Charles and Camilla. The other students are extremely wealthy, and Richard attempts to hide the truth of his economic background from them. Richard feels like an outsider at first, especially as he was forced to drop all his other classes to study with Julian. However, once Richard is invited to spend weekends with them at Francis’s country house, he begins to feel more a part of the group. 
Over winter break, Richard remains at Hampden, continuing to work for a psychology professor to earn money while living for free in an unheated warehouse. Richard suffers from cold and exhaustion until he is found by Henry, who has returned early from his trip to Italy with Bunny, and takes Richard to the hospital. Henry then allows Richard to stay with him until the dorms reopen. After Richard moves back to his dorm, he returns to Henry’s apartment for a textbook. There, he finds that Henry has booked four tickets from Boston to Argentina for himself, Francis, and the twins. After Richard realizes the four of them did not leave, Henry confides in Richard that they had planned to escape the country but could not get enough money to do so. Henry tells Richard of how they had a bacchanal at Francis’s country house, trying to achieve a state of Dionysiac madness, which they had discussed in Julian’s class. In the woods, they killed a farmer and left his body behind. 
Though none of them told Bunny about the farmer, he read about the man’s death in the paper and began to make jokes about the four of them committing murder. While Bunny and Henry were in Italy, Bunny read Henry’s journal, in which he wrote about the farmer. Henry and Francis have been paying for everything for Bunny to keep him quiet, though Bunny is getting more demanding and is taking his anger out on all of them. Henry toys with the idea of poisoning Bunny but eventually decides they will push him over a ravine while he is on his weekly hike. Richard is not supposed to join them, although on the day of the planned attack, Richard finds a note from Bunny in the library stating he has gone to a party. Richard goes to the woods to tell the others that Bunny will not be coming. However, Bunny does arrive, confused to find his friends there before they push him over the edge.
Snow begins to fall soon after Bunny is dead, so his body is not found for several days. During that time, the FBI descends on the campus, believing Bunny’s disappearance is related to drug dealing. After the snow melts, Bunny’s body is found, and his classmates go to his family’s home in Connecticut for the funeral. When they return to campus, they do not spend as much time together as they did before. Charles begins drinking even more than usual, getting pulled over while driving drunk, and passing out on a playground. Francis believes he is having a heart attack, which turns out to be anxiety. Richard begins to realize things about his friends, such as the fact that Charles and Camilla have a sexual relationship, and that Camilla and Henry have been manipulating him all along.
Richard and Francis take Charles to the country house, as Charles is increasingly paranoid about what Henry will do to him. Charles disappears after Henry calls, and Richard and Francis go to the hotel where Camilla has been staying to look for Charles. There, they find Camilla and Henry, who have begun a romantic relationship. Charles arrives with a gun, which Henry gets a hold of in the ensuing confusion. Henry whispers something to Camilla and then shoots himself in the head. After Henry’s death, Francis, Charles, and Camilla all leave Hampden, and Richard is the only one to graduate. The four of them grow apart, though Richard visits Francis and Camilla after Francis attempts suicide, and he learns that Charles and Camilla no longer speak. Despite the years that have passed, Richard remains in love with Camilla and still dreams of Henry."
Destinies,"On the Mediterranean Sea, Aeneas and his fellow Trojans flee from their home city of Troy, which has been destroyed by the Greeks. They sail for Italy, where Aeneas is destined to found Rome. As they near their destination, a fierce storm throws them off course and lands them in Carthage. Dido, Carthage’s founder and queen, welcomes them. Aeneas relates to Dido the long and painful story of his group’s travels thus far.
Aeneas tells of the sack of Troy that ended the Trojan War after ten years of Greek siege. In the final campaign, the Trojans were tricked when they accepted into their city walls a wooden horse that, unbeknownst to them, harbored several Greek soldiers in its hollow belly. He tells how he escaped the burning city with his father, Anchises; his son, Ascanius; and the hearth gods that represent their fallen city. Assured by the gods that a glorious future awaited him in Italy, he set sail with a fleet containing the surviving citizens of Troy. Aeneas relates the ordeals they faced on their journey. Twice they attempted to build a new city, only to be driven away by bad omens and plagues. Harpies, creatures that are part woman and part bird, cursed them, but they also encountered friendly countrymen unexpectedly. Finally, after the loss of Anchises and a bout of terrible weather, they made their way to Carthage.
Impressed by Aeneas’s exploits and sympathetic to his suffering, Dido, a Phoenician princess who fled her home and founded Carthage after her brother murdered her husband, falls in love with Aeneas. They live together as lovers for a period, until the gods remind Aeneas of his duty to found a new city. He determines to set sail once again. Dido is devastated by his departure, and kills herself by ordering a huge pyre to be built with Aeneas’s castaway possessions, climbing upon it, and stabbing herself with the sword Aeneas leaves behind.
As the Trojans make for Italy, bad weather blows them to Sicily, where they hold funeral games for the dead Anchises. The women, tired of the voyage, begin to burn the ships, but a downpour puts the fires out. Some of the travel-weary stay behind, while Aeneas, reinvigorated after his father visits him in a dream, takes the rest on toward Italy. Once there, Aeneas descends into the underworld, guided by the Sibyl of Cumae, to visit his father. He is shown a pageant of the future history and heroes of Rome, which helps him to understand the importance of his mission. Aeneas returns from the underworld, and the Trojans continue up the coast to the region of Latium.
The arrival of the Trojans in Italy begins peacefully. King Latinus, the Italian ruler, extends his hospitality, hoping that Aeneas will prove to be the foreigner whom, according to a prophecy, his daughter Lavinia is supposed to marry. But Latinus’s wife, Amata, has other ideas. She means for Lavinia to marry Turnus, a local suitor. Amata and Turnus cultivate enmity toward the newly arrived Trojans. Meanwhile, Ascanius hunts a stag that was a pet of the local herdsmen. A fight breaks out, and several people are killed. Turnus, riding this current of anger, begins a war.
Aeneas, at the suggestion of the river god Tiberinus, sails north up the Tiber to seek military support among the neighboring tribes. During this voyage, his mother, Venus, descends to give him a new set of weapons, wrought by Vulcan. While the Trojan leader is away, Turnus attacks. Aeneas returns to find his countrymen embroiled in battle. Pallas, the son of Aeneas’s new ally Evander, is killed by Turnus. Aeneas flies into a violent fury, and many more are slain by the day’s end.
The two sides agree to a truce so that they can bury the dead, and the Latin leaders discuss whether to continue the battle. They decide to spare any further unnecessary carnage by proposing a hand-to-hand duel between Aeneas and Turnus. When the two leaders face off, however, the other men begin to quarrel, and full-scale battle resumes. Aeneas is wounded in the thigh, but eventually the Trojans threaten the enemy city. Turnus rushes out to meet Aeneas, who wounds Turnus badly. Aeneas nearly spares Turnus but, remembering the slain Pallas, slays him instead."
Backward,"Julian West, the narrator of Looking Backward, was born into an aristocratic family in the late nineteenth century. The gap between the rich and poor was vast and seemingly impossible to remedy through any means. Like other members of his class, Julian thought himself superior to the toiling masses, and he regarded their frequent strikes with anger and contempt. Julian was engaged to Edith Bartlett, a beautiful, graceful Boston aristocrat. They planned to marry when the construction of their new home was completed, but the frequent strikes by the building trades had delayed their marriage for over a year.
Julian, a sufferer of insomnia, had secretly built an underground sleeping chamber to shield himself from street noises. He also enlisted the aid of Doctor Pillsbury, a skilled mesmerist, who never failed to leave Julian in a deep sleep. Pillsbury trained Julian's servant, Sawyer, to revive Julian from a mesmerized sleep. The night before Pillsbury left Boston for a new job in New Orleans, Julian enlisted his help one last time. After Pillsbury left, Julian's home was destroyed by a fire; Julian was protected by his underground chamber. Because no one knew of his chamber, Julian was assumed dead.
Over one hundred years later, Julian's secret chamber is discovered by Doctor Leete, who was preparing the site for the construction of a new laboratory. Julian has not aged a day because he has been in a state of suspended animation. Doctor Leete revives him and takes him into his home. Julian quickly learns that twentieth-century society is vastly different from that of the nineteenth century. The economy is based on publicly owned capital rather than private, as was the case in Julian's day. The government controls the means of production and divides the national product equally between all citizens. Every citizen receives a college-level education. Individuals are given a great deal of freedom in choosing a career, and everyone retires at the age of forty-five. Society is based on an ideal of the brotherhood of man, and it is unthinkable that any individual should suffer the evils of poverty or hunger. With Doctor Leete's guidance, Julian comes to understand and appreciate the twentieth-century society. Meanwhile, Julian learns that Doctor Leete's daughter, Edith is the great-granddaughter of Edith Bartlett. Julian and Edith become engaged, much to Doctor Leete's pleasure.
Julian has a terrible nightmare, in which he dreams that his transportation to the twentieth century was nothing but a dream. He finds himself trapped again in the cruel and inhumane world of the nineteenth century. To his great distress, he now sees all of the horrendous faults of nineteenth-century society. He tries to explain to his friends--Edith Bartlett and her family-- why their society is so awful and cruel, and how it can be transformed into something much better. However, they are only frightened and angered, so they expel Julian from their company. When Julian wakes from this nightmare to discover that his trip to the twentieth century was not just a dream, he is greatly relieved."
Wings,"It is the late twentieth century. Both the United States and the Soviet Union are about to enter outer space using nuclear-powered spaceships. Just as both countries close in on the achievement of space travel, a number of giant alien spaceships come down over every major city in the world.
Five years later, these aliens, known as the Overlords, have taken control of the entire world. Their flagship is based over New York and is managed by Karellen, the Overlord who is charge of Earth-related affairs. The humans know Karellen as ""the Supervisor."" Karellen uses the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Stormgren, as his liaison to the human race. Once every few weeks, Karellen meets with Stormgren inside his ship. However, neither Stormgren nor any other human has ever seen what an Overlord looks like.
Stormgren is attempting to placate the Freedom League, a group that opposes the Overlords' dominion, no matter how friendly the aliens seem to be. A radical fringe group of the Freedom League kidnaps Stormgren; Karellen uses Stormgren as bait so he can keep track of these radicals. The radicals do give Stormgren the idea to use a scanning device to try and find out what is inside the room where he and Karellen meet. Stormgren then meets with Karellen, who announces that the Overlords will reveal themselves in fifty years. Stormgren then uses the scanner and discovers that Karellen is on the other side of the blank ""viewscreen""--it's just a piece of one-way glass. Later, as he is handing over the paperwork for the World Federation, a new world government, Stormgren uses a flashlight to sneak a glimpse of Karellen.
Fifty years later, the Earth has greatly changed. It has become a utopia, where everyone has a place to live and enough food to eat. The Overlords have altered the world and raised the standard of living for everyone. At this time, the Overlords reveal themselves: they look almost exactly like the Devil, with dark black skin, giant wings, horns on their heads, and a barbed tail.
A few years later, George Greggson and Jean Morrel attend a party held by Rupert Boyce, an amateur scholar of the paranormal. While there, George and Jean run into Rashaverak, an Overlord making use of Boyce's research library. George also meets Jan Rodricks, a restless astronomer who is annoyed that the Overlords will not let mankind explore space. During the party, Boyce organizes a séance using a mechanized Ouija board. The board gives surprisingly accurate answers, and when Jan asks where the Overlords' homeworld is, it gives an exact star number. Jean faints after this incident. This fainting fit worries George, and he proposes marriage to Jean. Meanwhile, Jan takes the information he has learned and confirms it: the Overlord supply ships take off in the direction of the star given by the Ouija board. Rashaverak reports to Karellen and informs him that Jean should be watched, as she may be ""the most important human alive.""
After speaking again with Boyce, Jan gets an idea of how to sneak aboard an Overlord vessel. He meets with Sullivan and makes a plan to stow away inside a giant sperm whale that Sullivan is stuffing for the Overlords. The plan succeeds, and soon Jan is on his way to the Overlord homeworld. While the trip will seem like only a few months to him, due to time dilation at the speed of light eighty years will pass on Earth.
Back on Earth, George and Jean begin their life together. Eventually, George comes to believe he is stuck in a rut, and the couple decide to go to New Athens, an experimental community based on an island. The members of the community are primarily artists, and the hope is that they will reinvigorate the stagnating imagination of humanity. George and Jean take their two kids, Jeffrey and Jennifer, with them. The family adjusts to life on New Athens fairly well, but one day, a tsunami hits the island while Jeffrey is down at the beach. Jeffrey mysteriously survives and says that he heard a voice in his head that told him where to run.
A few weeks later, an Overlord visits New Athens. He tells the community he is just performing a routine inspection, but actually he is checking on Jeffrey. A few weeks after his visit, Jeffrey begins to have strange dreams, where he is walking across alien landscapes. His parents don't know what to make of the dreams, but the Overlords recognize the planets he describes as real worlds. George meets with Rashaverak, who tells him that his children aren't human-- they're something beyond humanity.
Jennifer, even though she is a baby, soon begins to exhibit powers herself--and her powers are even greater than those of Jeffrey. Soon all the children of the world are showing signs of strange mental powers. Karellen addresses all of mankind one last time, telling them that their children are taking a new evolutionary step. This is why the Overlords were sent to Earth--sent by the Overmind, a powerful being of thought and energy that absorbs and assimilates races once they have matured enough. Ironically, this is a step that the Overlords have never been able to make and may never be able to. The rest of humanity, however, is doomed. While the Overlords round up the children, many people decide to kill themselves. Jean and George die as New Athens blows itself up in a nuclear explosion.
Back on the Overlords spaceship, Jan arrives on the Overlords' homeworld. He is subjected to many tests by the curious Overlords and asked many questions. He is allowed to explore their cities a little bit, and he sees a strange mountain that may be an avatar of the Overmind. Finally, however, he is shipped back home. Nothing prepares him for what he sees: the Earth is deserted, except for three hundred million strange children. They have slowly been growing in power and ability, and their individual personalities have all but vanished. Soon, the Overmind will arrive, and the Earth will be destroyed as the children join the Overmind. While the Overlords prepare to leave, Jan decides to stay on Earth. As he watches, the Overmind arrives and absorbs the children. In the process, the children consume the Earth's crust, causing it to explode. The children consume all of the Earth for energy as they complete their transformation into the Overmind. From his ship, thousands of kilometers away, Karellen watches the end of humanity. He then awaits his next call from the Overmind and continues to explore its secrets."
Repeated,"In “moon,” the first of the four parts of feed, an American teenager named Titus travels to the lunar surface with his high-school friends for spring break, hoping to escape the boredom they feel on Earth. No specific date is revealed, though it’s sometime in a dystopic future, where the moon is fully commercialized and people suffer from red sores called lesions. As Titus and his fellow upper-class friends Link, Marty, Calista, Loga, and Quendy arrive on the moon, readers also get their first glimpse of “the feed.” Although Titus doesn’t initially reveal exact details about the feed or how it works, he says it sends the friends ads and images for where to stay and shop. 
After failing to get into college-age parties, the group visits the Ricochet Lounge, where Titus becomes infatuated with a girl named Violet. She is beautiful and, he soon finds, visiting the moon by herself and is very unlike his friends: She doesn’t make pointless purchases at a mall they all soon visit and isn’t interested in malfunctioning, or falling into a drug-like stupor, via their connections to the feed. Later, when they all visit a dance club called the Rumble Spot, an old man from a dissenter group called the Coalition of Pity hacks into people’s individual feeds, causing them to broadcast the signal, “we enter a time of calamity” over the feed’s network. Police beat the man and “shut off” those hacked, including Titus and Violet, who hold hands as they collapse.
Part 2, “eden,” occurs in a lunar hospital where Violet, Titus, and his friends remain disconnected from the feed until their systems can be scanned for viruses. There, Titus provides additional details about what the feed is and how it works. Feeds are implanted inside the body and connect to a global network that provides news, entertainment, and a means to purchase every kind of product, he says while singing its praises. The feed even anticipates and creates users’ wants from individual profiles based on purchasing decisions, thoughts, and feelings. Titus and Violet grow closer during the stay. Violet, who’s home-schooled and smarter than Titus and his friends, says she hoped to enjoy herself like normal kids but now has a problem, though she remains vague about what this problem is. When doctors finally restore the friends’ feeds, they rejoice. Promotions begin to flow through their minds again, though there’s also ominous news concerning protests over America’s annexation of the moon and resulting anger from a group called the Global Alliance. Still, Titus says, the friends exalt in the return of their feeds.
In Part 3, “Utopia,” Titus and his friends return to Earth and life returns to normal for them: “upcars” travel in tubes past vertically stacked suburbs, the friends party, and U.S. President Trumbull scoffs at reports that claim toxic industries cause lesions. In defiance of rampant consumerism and a loss of individuality, Violet determines to resist the feed by creating a completely random customer profile and asks Titus to join her. Violet, who didn’t receive her feed until she was seven, voices deep concern about the decline of the world and destruction of Earth, and laments how those who’ve had the feed their entire lives are ignorant and self-centered. Titus soon has nightmares that are more likely hacks from the Coalition of Pity. In them, he sees disturbing images of eco destruction and human suffering around the world, but after Violet chats him, saying she has seen the images too, he only wants to go back to sleep.
Before long, Violet’s problem becomes clear: Her body begins to fail and she’s told by doctors that the damage to her feedware can be fatal. The prognosis makes Violet realize how much she wants to do. She starts by going to the seashore with Titus, though they need to dress in protective suits due to its toxicity. Meanwhile, feed chatter reveals that all of Earth’s forests have fallen and there is a growing rift between the U.S. and the Global Alliance. At a party where Quendy shows off her artificial lesions, Violet becomes outraged and her body falters. She chastises Titus and his friends for living in ignorance as the world dies, then collapses and is brought to the hospital. 
Violet’s condition declines further in Part 4, “slumberland,” whose chapter titles track her feed efficiency from a high of 87.3 percent to a low of 4.6 percent, 98 percent being optimal. Aware that she doesn’t have much time, Violet messages Titus a list of twenty-two things she wants to do in life, though he grows increasingly distant, and doesn’t message back. When they do reconnect, Violet sends Titus a recent memory where she falls down a staircase and receives a response from the corporation FeedTech, denying her petition to pay for her system repairs because she wasn’t deemed to be worthy due to her random customer profile. Violet later sends Titus childhood memories to preserve her history, though he deletes them. And when Violet convinces him to visit the mountains with her, one of her life goals, Titus breaks up with her, saying he was only interested in a short relationship while she wanted something eternal. 
Time passes and Titus eventually hears from Violet’s father. At Violet’s home, Titus sees her lying on a floating bed, completely pale, fully incapacitated, and covered in discs. Her father details her final, painful days and how her body failed. He then berates Titus for how badly he treated Violet and for willfully living in ignorance. Titus later visits Violet’s home a second time. Although she appears dead, her feed efficiency is at 4.6 percent and a screen shows that her heart is beating slightly. Nevertheless, Titus tells Violet a story he plans to keep telling her, he says, so she will remember herself. The story is about Violet, the end of America, and their relationship, where they learn something important about love and how to resist the feed. The book ends with a promotion on the feed for Blue-Jean Warehouse’s Final Sales Event and a recurring, fading message that “Everything must go.”"
Second,"Revolutionary and incendiary, The Second Sex is one of the earliest attempts to confront human history from a feminist perspective. It won de Beauvoir many admirers and just as many detractors. Today, many regard this massive and meticulously researched masterwork as not only as pillar of feminist thought but of twentieth-century philosophy in general.
De Beauvoir’s primary thesis is that men fundamentally oppress women by characterizing them, on every level, as the Other, defined exclusively in opposition to men. Man occupies the role of the self, or subject; woman is the object, the other. He is essential, absolute, and transcendent. She is inessential, incomplete, and mutilated. He extends out into the world to impose his will on it, whereas woman is doomed to immanence, or inwardness. He creates, acts, invents; she waits for him to save her. This distinction is the basis of all de Beauvoir’s later arguments.
De Beauvoir states that while it is natural for humans to understand themselves in opposition to others, this process is flawed when applied to the genders. In defining woman exclusively as Other, man is effectively denying her humanity.
The Second Sex chronicles de Beauvoir’s effort to locate the source of these profoundly imbalanced gender roles. In Book I, entitled “Facts and Myths,” she asks how “female humans” come to occupy a subordinate position in society. To answer this question—and to better understand her own identity—de Beauvoir first turns to biology, psychoanalysis, and historical materialism. These disciplines reveal indisputable “essential” differences between men and women but provide no justification for woman’s inferiority. They all take woman’s inferior “destiny” for granted.
She then moves to history to trace the emergence of male superiority in society, from nomadic hunter-gatherers through the French Revolution and contemporary times. Here she finds ample examples of female subordination, but again, no persuasive justification for them. History, she argues, is not an immutable “fact,” but a reflection of certain attitudes, preconceptions, and injustices.
De Beauvoir next discusses various mythical representations of women and demonstrates how these myths have imprinted human consciousness, often to the disservice of women. De Beauvoir hopes to debunk the persistent myth of the “eternal feminine” by showing that it arose from male discomfort with the fact of his own birth. Throughout history, maternity has been both worshipped and reviled: the mother both brings life and heralds death. These mysterious operations get projected onto the woman, who is transformed into a symbol of “life” and in the process is robbed of all individuality. To illustrate the prevalence of these myths, de Beauvoir studies the portrayal of women by five modern writers. In the end of this section, de Beauvoir examines the impact of these myths on individual experience. She concludes that the “eternal feminine” fiction is reinforced by biology, psychoanalysis, history, and literature.
De Beauvoir insists on the impossibility of comparing the “character” of men and women without considering the immense differences in their situation, and in Book II, entitled “Woman’s Life Today,” she turns to the concrete realities of this situation. She traces female development through its formative stages: childhood, youth, and sexual initiation. Her goal is to prove that women are not born “feminine” but shaped by a thousand external processes. She shows how, at each stage of her upbringing, a girl is conditioned into accepting passivity, dependence, repetition, and inwardness. Every force in society conspires to deprive her of subjectivity and flatten her into an object. Denied the possibility of independent work or creative fulfillment, the woman must accept a dissatisfying life of housework, childbearing, and sexual slavishness.
Having brought the woman to adulthood, de Beauvoir analyzes the various “situations,” or roles, the adult woman inhabits. The bourgeois woman performs three major functions: wife, mother, and entertainer. No matter how illustrious the woman’s household may be, these roles inevitably lead to immanence, incompleteness, and profound frustration. Even those who accept a less conventional place in society—as a prostitute or courtesan, for example—must submit to imperatives defined by the male. De Beauvoir also reflects on the trauma of old age. When a woman loses her reproductive capacity, she loses her primary purpose and therefore her identity. In the final chapter of this section, “Woman’s Situation and Character,” de Beauvoir reiterates the controversial claim that woman’s situation is not a result of her character. Rather, her character is a result of her situation. Her mediocrity, complacency, lack of accomplishment, laziness, passivity—all these qualities are the consequences of her subordination, not the cause.
In “Justifications,” de Beauvoir studies some of the ways that women reinforce their own dependency. Narcissists, women in love, and mystics all embrace their immanence by drowning selfhood in an external object—whether it be the mirror, a lover, or God. Throughout the book, de Beauvoir mentions such instances of females being complicit in their Otherness, particularly with regard to marriage. The difficulty of breaking free from “femininity”—of sacrificing security and comfort for some ill-conceived notion of “equality”—induces many women to accept the usual unfulfilling roles of wife and mother. From the very beginning of her discussion, de Beauvoir identifies the economic underpinnings of female subordination—and the economic roots of woman’s liberation. Only in work can she achieve autonomy. If woman can support herself, she can also achieve a form of liberation. In the concluding chapters of The Second Sex, de Beauvoir discusses the logistical hurdles woman faces in pursuing this goal."
Hundreds,"One Hundred Years of Solitude is the history of the isolated town of Macondo and of the family who founds it, the Buendías. For years, the town has no contact with the outside world, except for gypsies who occasionally visit, peddling technologies like ice and telescopes. The patriarch of the family, José Arcadio Buendía, is impulsive and inquisitive. He remains a leader who is also deeply solitary, alienating himself from other men in his obsessive investigations into mysterious matters. These character traits are inherited by his descendents throughout the novel. His older child, José Arcadio, inherits his vast physical strength and his impetuousness. His younger child, Aureliano, inherits his intense, enigmatic focus. Gradually, the village loses its innocent, solitary state when it establishes contact with other towns in the region. Civil wars begin, bringing violence and death to peaceful Macondo, which, previously, had experienced neither, and Aureliano becomes the leader of the Liberal rebels, achieving fame as Colonel Aureliano Buendía. Macondo changes from an idyllic, magical, and sheltered place to a town irrevocably connected to the outside world through the notoriety of Colonel Buendía. Macondo’s governments change several times during and after the war. At one point, Arcadio, the cruelest of the Buendías, rules dictatorially and is eventually shot by a firing squad. Later, a mayor is appointed, and his reign is peaceful until another civil uprising has him killed. After his death, the civil war ends with the signing of a peace treaty.
More than a century goes by over the course of the book, and so most of the events that García Márquez describes are the major turning points in the lives of the Buendías: births, deaths, marriages, love affairs. Some of the Buendía men are wild and sexually rapacious, frequenting brothels and taking lovers. Others are quiet and solitary, preferring to shut themselves up in their rooms to make tiny golden fish or to pore over ancient manuscripts. The women, too, range from the outrageously outgoing, like Meme, who once brings home seventy-two friends from boarding school, to the prim and proper Fernanda del Carpio, who wears a special nightgown with a hole at the crotch when she consummates her marriage with her husband.
	A sense of the family’s destiny for greatness remains alive in its tenacious matriarch, Ursula Iguarán, and she works devotedly to keep the family together despite its differences. But for the Buendía family, as for the entire village of Macondo, the centrifugal forces of modernity are devastating. Imperialist capitalism reaches Macondo as a banana plantation moves in and exploits the land and the workers, and the Americans who own the plantation settle in their own fenced-in section of town. Eventually, angry at the inhumane way in which they are treated, the banana workers go on strike. Thousands of them are massacred by the army, which sides with the plantation owners. When the bodies have been dumped into the sea, five years of ceaseless rain begin, creating a flood that sends Macondo into its final decline. As the city, beaten down by years of violence and false progress, begins to slip away, the Buendía family, too, begins its process of final erasure, overcome by nostalgia for bygone days. The book ends almost as it began: the village is once again solitary, isolated. The few remaining Buendía family members turn in upon themselves incestuously, alienated from the outside world and doomed to a solitary ending. In the last scene of the book, the last surviving Buendía translates a set of ancient prophecies and finds that all has been predicted: that the village and its inhabitants have merely been living out a preordained cycle, incorporating great beauty and great, tragic sadness."
Primarily,"Franny and Zooey is composed of two sections, which were originally published in the New Yorker magazine as two separate short stories. The first story or section, ""Franny,"" was published in the New Yorker in January 1955. In ""Franny,"" Franny Glass meets her boyfriend Lane Coutell for a football weekend at his college. They do not get to join many of the festivities, though, because during their first lunch together, Franny begins to have a breakdown. She tells Lane that she is sick of the phoniness at school and of the egotism of the faculty. She has quit the play she was in because she is embarrassed about what she feels to be acting fake. As she gets worked up, she reveals that she has become interested in the ""Jesus prayer,"" a continuous prayer meant to cleanse one's spirit. Lane mostly brushes off Franny's concerns until she faints on the way to the bathroom. As he is helping to revive her, she begins to speak the prayer.
""Zooey"" basically picks up where ""Franny"" left off. First, though, the narrator names himself. The man claiming to be the author of the story is Buddy Glass, one of Franny and Zooey's older brothers. The story resumes. It is the Monday after the weekend Franny's breakdown started, and Zooey is at home in New York City. In his conversation with his mother, Bessie Glass, it is revealed that Franny is now at home, sleeping and crying on the living room sofa. Bessie wants Zooey to talk to Franny, which he eventually does. The two of them have a long theological and personal discussion. We learn that the two of them have basically been raised on a blend of different religions, taught to them by their older brothers Buddy and Seymour. Over the course of this long discussion, Zooey helps Franny sort out her spiritual and personal beliefs, allowing her, by the end, to find peace."
Guarantees,"Euripedes' Medea opens in a state of conflict. Jason has abandoned his wife, Medea, along with their two children. He hopes to advance his station by remarrying with Glauce, the daughter of Creon, king of Corinth, the Greek city where the play is set. All the events of play proceed out of this initial dilemma, and the involved parties become its central characters.
Outside the royal palace, a nurse laments the events that have lead to the present crisis. After a long series of trials and adventures, which ultimately forced Jason and Medea to seek exile in Corinth, the pair had settled down and established their family, achieving a degree of fame and respectability. Jason's recent abandonment of that family has crushed Medea emotionally, to the degree that she curses her own existence, as well as that of her two children.
Fearing a possible plot of revenge, Creon banishes Medea and her children from the city. After pleading for mercy, Medea is granted one day before she must leave, during which she plans to complete her quest for ""justice""--at this stage in her thinking, the murder of Creon, Glauce, and Jason. Jason accuses Medea of overreacting. By voicing her grievances so publicly, she has endangered her life and that of their children. He claims that his decision to remarry was in everyone's best interest. Medea finds him spineless, and she refuses to accept his token offers of help.
Appearing by chance in Corinth, Aegeus, King of Athens, offers Medea sanctuary in his home city in exchange for her knowledge of certain drugs that can cure his sterility. Now guaranteed an eventual haven in Athens, Medea has cleared all obstacles to completing her revenge, a plan which grows to include the murder of her own children; the pain their loss will cause her does not outweigh the satisfaction she will feel in making Jason suffer.
For the balance of the play, Medea engages in a ruse; she pretends to sympathize with Jason (bringing him into her confidence) and offers his wife ""gifts,"" a coronet and dress. Ostensibly, the gifts are meant to convince Glauce to ask her father to allow the children to stay in Corinth. The coronet and dress are actually poisoned, however, and their delivery causes Glauce's death. Seeing his daughter ravaged by the poison, Creon chooses to die by her side by dramatically embracing her and absorbing the poison himself.
A messenger recounts the gruesome details of these deaths, which Medea absorbs with cool attentiveness. Her earlier state of anxiety, which intensified as she struggled with the decision to commit infanticide, has now given way to an assured determination to fulfill her plans. Against the protests of the chorus, Medea murders her children and flees the scene in a dragon-pulled chariot provided by her grandfather, the Sun-God. Jason is left cursing his lot; his hope of advancing his station by abandoning Medea and marrying Glauce, the conflict which opened the play, has been annihilated, and everything he values has been lost through the deaths that conclude the tragedy."
Overwhelming,"In Outliers: The Story of Success, Malcolm Gladwell considers the circumstances that lead to success. The first half of the book looks closely at how opportunities matter more in the lives of successful people than hard work or raw talent. The second half of the book focuses on cultural legacies: behavioral tendencies rooted in their ancestral past.
Part One examines the role of opportunity in the lives of extremely successful people. Gladwell’s first example is the Canadian Hockey League, the world’s most competitive youth hockey league. Since the cutoff date for the Canadian leagues that serve the youngest players is January 1, those born in the first part of the calendar year are much larger and more coordinated than their peers. The larger and more coordinated kids are given more playing time and better coaching, and thus become better players by the time they reach the top league. An overwhelming majority of Canadian professional hockey players have birthdays in January, February or March.
Gladwell proposes that 10,000 hours of practice is needed to master a skill, even for prodigies like Mozart. Bill Joy, Bill Gates, and the Beatles all worked hard to achieve success but benefited from opportunities they did not create. Joy, one of the founders of Sun Microsystems, happened to attend one of the first colleges in the world with a time-sharing terminal. In graduate school, he had a terminal in his room, where he spent all of his free time programming. Gates happened to attend a private high school with a time-sharing terminal connected to a mainframe in Seattle. He also was able to spend all of his free time programming. Early on, the Beatles were hired to play long shows day after day in Hamburg, Germany. 
Birth year or era is another form of opportunity. Gates and Joy (as well as other early programmers) all reached the end of their teen years just as personal computers became available to the public. In another example, fourteen of the top seventy-five richest people in the history of the world happened to be alive at the same time, in the same country: the United States in the mid-1800s.
Opportunity matters more than an individual’s IQ. Using a study conducted by Lewis Terman, the creator of the Stanford-Binet IQ test, Gladwell shows that “practical intelligence” is as important as “analytical intelligence.” He also contrasts Chris Langan, one of the world’s smartest living people, with Robert Oppenheimer. While both had difficulties in college, only Oppenheimer had a successful life, due to his practical intelligence.
The last portion of Part One looks at Joe Flom, a successful lawyer from New York City. While he was born into a poor family to Jewish immigrants (in a time when Jewish immigrants were not treated well), many of the disadvantages in his life were actually benefits and directly contributed to his success.
Part Two investigates cultural legacies. Using flight recorder transcripts from several plane crashes from the last few decades, Gladwell shows that cultural expectations and habits can be a severe hindrance to pilots. Copilots from countries that have a high “Power Distance Index” (those that show the most deference to authority) will often avoid telling pilots that they are making mistakes, even when the mistakes are potentially fatal. After recognizing the dangers of such cultural expectations, commercial aviation has instituted programs to change the way flight crews talk with one another. 
Gladwell next analyzes the disparity in public school math test scores between Eastern and Western countries. He suggests that the cultures in which rice paddy farming is historically important have a stronger work ethic. Using various examples, Gladwell shows that hard work has a greater impact on success in learning mathematics than intelligence. 
The final example is an examination of the KIPP school in the South Bronx and the “achievement gap” between socioeconomic groups. American students from middle-class and affluent households retain more information over summer vacation and are more likely to make additional gains than students from low-income households. The KIPP school uses longer school days and summer programming to eliminate the achievement gap for low-income children. While the work schedule is very rigorous, the school’s students go on to great academic success.
Gladwell demonstrates that if more opportunities were available, there would be far more successful people and the world would be richer for it."
Undoubted,"Mrs. Dalloway covers one day from morning to night in one woman’s life. Clarissa Dalloway, an upper-class housewife, walks through her London neighborhood to prepare for the party she will host that evening. When she returns from flower shopping, an old suitor and friend, Peter Walsh, drops by her house unexpectedly. The two have always judged each other harshly, and their meeting in the present intertwines with their thoughts of the past. Years earlier, Clarissa refused Peter’s marriage proposal, and Peter has never quite gotten over it. Peter asks Clarissa if she is happy with her husband, Richard, but before she can answer, her daughter, Elizabeth, enters the room. Peter leaves and goes to Regent’s Park. He thinks about Clarissa’s refusal, which still obsesses him. 
The point of view then shifts to Septimus, a veteran of World War I who was injured in trench warfare and now suffers from shell shock. Septimus and his Italian wife, Lucrezia, pass time in Regent’s Park. They are waiting for Septimus’s appointment with Sir William Bradshaw, a celebrated psychiatrist. Before the war, Septimus was a budding young poet and lover of Shakespeare; when the war broke out, he enlisted immediately for romantic patriotic reasons. He became numb to the horrors of war and its aftermath: when his friend Evans died, he felt little sadness. Now Septimus sees nothing of worth in the England he fought for, and he has lost the desire to preserve either his society or himself. Suicidal, he believes his lack of feeling is a crime. Clearly Septimus’s experiences in the war have permanently scarred him, and he has serious mental problems. However, Sir William does not listen to what Septimus says and diagnoses “a lack of proportion.” Sir William plans to separate Septimus from Lucrezia and send him to a mental institution in the country. 
Richard Dalloway eats lunch with Hugh Whitbread and Lady Bruton, members of high society. The men help Lady Bruton write a letter to the Times, London's largest newspaper. After lunch, Richard returns home to Clarissa with a large bunch of roses. He intends to tell her that he loves her but finds that he cannot, because it has been so long since he last said it. Clarissa considers the void that exists between people, even between husband and wife. Even though she values the privacy she is able to maintain in her marriage, considering it vital to the success of the relationship, at the same time she finds slightly disturbing the fact that Richard doesn’t know everything about her. Clarissa sees off Elizabeth and her history teacher, Miss Kilman, who are going shopping. The two older women despise one another passionately, each believing the other to be an oppressive force over Elizabeth. Meanwhile, Septimus and Lucrezia are in their apartment, enjoying a moment of happiness together before the men come to take Septimus to the asylum. One of Septimus’s doctors, Dr. Holmes, arrives, and Septimus fears the doctor will destroy his soul. In order to avoid this fate, he jumps from a window to his death. 
Peter hears the ambulance go by to pick up Septimus’s body and marvels ironically at the level of London’s civilization. He goes to Clarissa’s party, where most of the novel’s major characters are assembled. Clarissa works hard to make her party a success but feels dissatisfied by her own role and acutely conscious of Peter’s critical eye. All the partygoers, but especially Peter and Sally Seton, have, to some degree, failed to accomplish the dreams of their youth. Though the social order is undoubtedly changing, Elizabeth and the members of her generation will probably repeat the errors of Clarissa’s generation. Sir William Bradshaw arrives late, and his wife explains that one of his patients, the young veteran (Septimus), has committed suicide. Clarissa retreats to the privacy of a small room to consider Septimus’s death. She understands that he was overwhelmed by life and that men like Sir William make life intolerable. She identifies with Septimus, admiring him for having taken the plunge and for not compromising his soul. She feels, with her comfortable position as a society hostess, responsible for his death. The party nears its close as guests begin to leave. Clarissa enters the room, and her presence fills Peter with a great excitement."
Common,"In Common Sense, Thomas Paine argues for American independence. His argument begins with more general, theoretical reflections about government and religion, then progresses onto the specifics of the colonial situation.
Paine begins by distinguishing between government and society. Society, according to Paine, is everything constructive and good that people join together to accomplish. Government, on the other hand, is an institution whose sole purpose is to protect us from our own vices. Government has its origins in the evil of man and is therefore a necessary evil at best. Paine says that government's sole purpose is to protect life, liberty and property, and that a government should be judged solely on the basis of the extent to which it accomplishes this goal.
Paine then considers an imagined scenario in which a small group of people has been placed on an island, and cut off from the rest of society. In time, these people develop ties with one another, and lawmaking becomes inevitable. Paine says the people will be much happier if they are responsible for the creation of the laws that rule them. Paine is also implicitly arguing that such a system of representation is also better for the American colonists. Having expressed his disagreement with British reign in America, Paine proceeds to launch a general attack on the British system of government. Paine says the British system is too complex and rife with contradictions, and that the monarchy is granted far too much power. The British system pretends to offer a reasonable system of checks and balances, but in fact, it does not.
From here Paine moves on to discuss, in general, the notions of monarchy and hereditary succession. Man, Pain argues, was born into a state of equality, and the distinction that has arisen between king and subject is an unnatural one. At first, Paine says, the world was without kings, but the ancient Jews decided they wanted a king. This angered God, but he allowed them to have one. Paine presents pages of biblical evidence detailing God's wrath at the idea of the Jews having a king. The conclusion Paine reaches is that the practice of monarchy originates from sin, and is an institution that the Bible and God condemn. Paine calls hereditary succession an abominable practice. He says that even if people were to choose to have a king, that does not legitimize that King's child acting as a future ruler. Furthermore, hereditary succession has brought with it innumerable evils, such as incompetent kings, corruption, and civil war.
Having dispensed with the preliminary theoretical issues, Paine sets in to discuss the details of the American situation. In response to the argument that America has flourished under British rule, and therefore ought to stay under the king, Paine says that such an argument fails to realize that America has evolved and no longer needs Britain's help. Some say that Britain has protected America, and therefore deserves allegiance, but Paine responds that Britain has only watched over America in order to secure its own economic well-being. Paine adds that most recently, instead of watching over the colonies, the British have been attacking them, and are therefore undeserving of American loyalty.
Paine says that the colonies have little to gain from remaining attached to Britain. Commerce can be better conducted with the rest of Europe, but only after America becomes independent. Paine also asserts that if the colonies remain attached to Britain, the same problems that have arisen in the past will arise in the future. Paine argues that it is necessary to seek independence now, as to do otherwise would only briefly cover up problems that will surely reemerge.
Paine even proposes the form of government that the independent colonies should adopt. His recommendation is for a representative democracy that gives roughly equal weight to each of the colonies.
Paine explains why the current time is a good time to break free of Britain. Primarily, Paine focuses on the present size of the colonies, and on their current capabilities. He presents an inventory of the British Navy and gives calculations revealing how America could build a navy of comparable size. Paine recommends this as a way of ensuring America's security and prosperity in trade. Paine also argues that America is sufficiently small as to be united now. If time were to elapse, and the population of the colonies to grow, the same feeling of unity would not be present. Paine adds that if the Americans revolt now, they can use the vast expanses of uncharted land to the West in order to pay down some of the debt they will incur.
Paine says that as a colony of Britain, America lacks respectability on the international scene. They are seen simply as rebels, and cannot form substantial alliances with other nations. In order to prosper in the long term, the colonies need to be independent. Paine says that, by declaring independence, America will be able to ask for the help of other countries in its struggle for freedom. For all of these reasons, Paine says it is imperative and urgent that the colonies declare independence."
Borne,"In Born a Crime: Stories from a South African Childhood, comedian and television personality Trevor Noah gives a heartfelt and funny recounting of his experiences growing up in South Africa as an oppressed person. Stories of Noah’s life are interspersed with insights into South Africa’s culture, systems, and history. Noah was born in 1984 to a single mother, Patricia, during the time of racial segregation known as apartheid. Patricia was a strong, driven woman who paid little heed to the racist laws that oppressed her. Noah’s father, Robert, agreed to give Patricia a child during a time when sexual relationships between black and white South Africans were illegal. Robert, a Swiss immigrant, never supported segregation and did what he could to undermine apartheid. Because it was dangerous for Patricia and Robert to be seen with their mixed-race child, Noah recalls sometimes being momentarily abandoned by his parents in public settings.
Dutch colonizers came to South Africa in the 1600s and used slave labor to run their farms on stolen land. The white South Africans called Afrikaners are descended from these colonizers. Black South Africans, from tribes including the Zulu, Xhosa, and Sotho tribes, were subjugated under apartheid law until the mid-1990s. A third racial group emerged from the intermingling of the Black and white South Africans: mixed-race or “colored.” Both during apartheid and after its dissolution, mixed-race South Africans were the most marginalized and disenfranchised people. Noah often felt defined by what he wasn’t: not light enough to be labeled as white and not dark enough to be fully accepted into Black culture.
Apartheid ended in 1994, but Noah’s struggles as a mixed-race child in South Africa continued. It was often hard for Noah to determine which groups would accept him. Patricia had always encouraged her son to read and think independently; she valued education and made sure that her son spoke multiple languages. Of the eleven official languages in South Africa, Noah could speak Zulu, Tsonga, English, and Afrikaans. This skill allowed him to move among different racial and cultural groups at school. Though Noah felt out of place in many social settings, his ability to talk and empathize with many different types of people served him well throughout his life. Even at a young age, Noah understood that the bullying he experienced from his mixed-race peers was likely a result of the self-hatred all mixed-race South Africans had been taught. Noah was a mischievous child, but Patricia believed in tempering her punishments with assurances to her son that she held him accountable because she loved him. Patricia knew that the world would not always be kind and generous to Noah, and she wanted to prepare him well.
During his high school years, Noah acquired a small bootleg CD business from a friend. Noah soon found that he could make more money working with his friend Sizwe, who was from the poorer, crowded Johannesburg township called Alexandra—known to most residents as Alex. After graduation Noah moved to Alex to expand his profits, with Sizwe’s help. Sizwe recognized that Noah had talent as a live DJ, and the pair formed a performance group. Noah and his group sold bootleg and mixed CDs, dealt in stolen goods, performed at parties and concerts, and did their best to avoid confrontations with local law enforcement. Noah was already familiar with the South African police. Patricia received no help from the local police when she tried to file charges against her abusive husband. Noah was arrested for shoplifting, on suspicion of carrying a weapon, and for driving an unregistered vehicle. One arrest kept Noah in jail for several days, and Patricia had to pay for his lawyer. Despite his dealings with law enforcement, Noah could see his own privilege in comparison to many of his peers. Patricia had worked hard to make sure her son had the ability to make a life for himself.
The men in Noah’s life taught him little about how to interact with women. Robert was a distant but generally pleasant presence. Patricia’s father, Temperance Noah, was an unpredictable figure. Later, Noah would learn that his grandfather had bipolar disorder and would often beat his wife, Frances. Patricia experienced abuse in her marriage as well. Noah’s stepfather, Abel, became acquainted with Patricia and her young son during their many visits to the automotive shop where Abel worked on their run-down car. After Abel and Patricia married, he bought the shop. Patricia was forced to sell her home to keep the business running, and the family spent a stressful year living in the shop warehouse. Abel often came home drunk, and he began beating his wife. Once Abel had sons of his own, Noah’s half-brothers Andrew and Isaac, Abel’s hostility toward Patricia’s oldest son grew. When Patricia learned that her violent husband had bought a gun, she helped Noah move out on his own. 
One day, Noah received a phone call from Andrew with news that Abel, now estranged from his family, had come to Patricia’s new house and shot her in the head as she was shielding Andrew and Isaac. Miraculously, Patricia survived. Noah was able to cover her medical bills, and Patricia thanked God for protecting her and giving her a son who could afford to help her."
Demonstrations,"Marjane “Marji” Satrapi is an intelligent, spirited, and very modern girl living with her parents in Iran’s capital of Tehran during the eventful period of Iranian history from the late 1970s into the early 1980s. In Persepolis: The Story of a Childhood, Marji’s remembers her life during those years, mostly from when she was about ten to age fourteen. This account includes how Marji and her family lived through and were affected by turbulent events that included the overthrow of the autocratic Shah of Iran by the Islamic revolution, the oppressive fundamentalist regime that replaced the Shah, and the devasting Iran-Iraq war.
The nation’s wealth has long made it a target of outside invaders, but Islamic revolution of 1979 has pushed out the Western-backed government of the Shah.  The revolution has ushered in a new Islamic regime that is bringing massive societal changes impacting how people are supposed to behave--including Marji and her family. Marji struggles to adjust to the changes at her liberal French bilingual school, which has become increasingly stricter. Girls are required to wear veils and female and male students are now separated. Marji’s wealthy and modern parents—her father, Ebi, and her mother, Taji—take part in the massive protests against the new regime’s strict rules on behavior (just as they had previously protested against the Shah’s regime). Marji’s parents worry when a photo of Marji’s mother a protest appears in newspapers magazines. Later, after a demonstration they are at turns violent, the Satrapis decide that openly protesting is too dangerous to continue to do.
Marji feels conflict between her own deeply spiritual feelings and the stark modernism of her parents. She talks to God at night and has believed she will become a prophet one day since she was six years old, Marji. But the revolution leads to Marji setting aside these ambitions while she studies and imitates protestors and revolutionaries. She mimics protestors in the garden of her house and studies books about famous revolutionaries and philosophers given to her by her parents. She fantasizes about becoming a hero and wants her parents to become heroes too. Marji’s relationship with God becomes strained, as she finds that she and God have less to talk about—although God does still come by to see her from time to time.
Marji thrills when she learns that rebels fill her family history. She learns that her grandfather was a prince and later a communist whom the Shah removed from power and that her uncle Anoosh, also a communist, spent nine years in prison during the Shah’s regime. Marji spends a short time with Anoosh, learning about his life. After the Shah fell from power in 1979, Anoosh was released from prison, but when Islamic fundamentalists consolidate their grip on power, they hunt Anoosh down, imprison him, and later execute him. Her new idol killed, Marji feels crushed. She completely abandons her faith in God and increasingly questions the pro-regime propaganda she hears—especially at school.
Marji deeply loves and identifies with of her parents, even if she does sometimes feel that their actions and behavior (as wealthy and privileged individuals) do not always live up to their pro-democratic and liberal rhetoric. Marji also has a special connection with her grandmother, who remains stoic and inspiring to Marji in spite of the turmoil and numerous tragedies stemming from political actions that impact her and the family. Marji’s uncle Anoosh is not Marji’s only direct experience with the cruel consequences of the government’s actions. Throughout the book, death and devastation occurs among Marji’s extended family and friends as direct results of the brutality and fanaticism of the Iranian regimes and the war with Iraq.
People had rejoiced when the Shah was forced out, but as Islamic fundamentalists retain power, Marji and her family watch as their neighbors’ behavior shifts back and forth to coincide with the current political winds. The neighbors go from wearing short skirts and drinking alcohol to covering themselves and denouncing the use of alcohol. Marji’s parents ask her to tell everyone that she prays every day, a lie they hope will keep Marji safe, but acknowledge that the rules seem foolish. Marji grows more rebellious, as she increasingly views the rules at school and elsewhere as hypocritical and difficult to follow. Armed with more knowledge and personal experience, Marji begins to act out in ways that put her safety at risk. In fact, she even (accidentally) hits her principal during an argument, which results in her expulsion from school. Fearing her rebellious behavior will get her killed, Marji’s mother tries to reason with Marji by telling her that it is not her responsibility to serve justice and that the bad guys eventually pay for their sins in the end.
The war with Iraq had originally inspired Marji to vocal patriotism in protection her country against another invasion, but Marji begins to realize there are greater forces behind the war. She sees how the Islamic regime needs the war to continue survive and keep power. The war promotes a sense of nationalism and pride in the public, and those who die in the war are hailed as “martyrs.” Marji sees thousands of poor boys lured into war without proper training. She becomes increasingly uncomfortable and aware of class differences within society. Poor young boys are lured into the army with gold-painted keys to the “kingdom of heaven” to help them enter paradise after dying on the battlefield, while children in her wealthy neighborhood are left alone.
More and more people try to escape Iran as the borders tighten and Iraqi forces bomb Tehran and other Iranian cities. Realizing that Marji’s chances of escaping Iran are narrowing, her parents make the difficult decision to send her abroad alone to finish school in Vienna, explaining that only a good education will free her of Iran. Marji feels heartbroken. She spends one last night with her grandmother, who gives her warm advice and inspires her to be compassionate and understanding while in Vienna. Marji gives away all of her prized contraband to her friends, including a Kim Wilde poster. At the airport, as Marji turns to say goodbye to her parents one last time to see that her mother, devasted by her only child’s departure, has fainted."
Words,"The convict Jean Valjean is released from a French prison after serving nineteen years for stealing a loaf of bread and for subsequent attempts to escape from prison. When Valjean arrives at the town of Digne, no one is willing to give him shelter because he is an ex-convict. Desperate, Valjean knocks on the door of M. Myriel, the kindly bishop of Digne. Myriel treats Valjean with kindness, and Valjean repays the bishop by stealing his silverware. When the police arrest Valjean, Myriel covers for him, claiming that the silverware was a gift. The authorities release Valjean and Myriel makes him promise to become an honest man. Eager to fulfill his promise, Valjean masks his identity and enters the town of Montreuil-sur-mer. Under the assumed name of Madeleine, Valjean invents an ingenious manufacturing process that brings the town prosperity. He eventually becomes the town’s mayor.
Fantine, a young woman from Montreuil, lives in Paris. She falls in love with Tholomyès, a wealthy student who gets her pregnant and then abandons her. Fantine returns to her home village with her daughter, Cosette. On the way to Montreuil, however, Fantine realizes that she will never be able to find work if the townspeople know that she has an illegitimate child. In the town of Montfermeil, she meets the Thénardiers, a family that runs the local inn. The Thénardiers agree to look after Cosette as long as Fantine sends them a monthly allowance.
In Montreuil, Fantine finds work in Madeleine’s factory. Fantine’s coworkers find out about Cosette, however, and Fantine is fired. The Thénardiers demand more money to support Cosette, and Fantine resorts to prostitution to make ends meet. One night, Javert, Montreuil’s police chief, arrests Fantine. She is to be sent to prison, but Madeleine intervenes. Fantine has fallen ill, and when she longs to see Cosette, Madeleine promises to send for her. First, however, he must contend with Javert, who has discovered Madeleine’s criminal past. Javert tells Madeleine that a man has been accused of being Jean Valjean, and Madeleine confesses his true identity. Javert shows up to arrest Valjean while Valjean is at Fantine’s bedside, and Fantine dies from the shock.
After a few years, Valjean escapes from prison and heads to Montfermeil, where he is able to buy Cosette from the Thénardiers. The Thénardiers turn out to be a family of scoundrels who abuse Cosette while spoiling their own two daughters, Eponine and Azelma. Valjean and Cosette move to a run-down part of Paris. Javert discovers their hideout, however, and they are forced to flee. They find refuge in a convent, where Cosette attends school and Valjean works as a gardener.
Marius Pontmercy is a young man who lives with his wealthy grandfather, M. Gillenormand. Because of political differences within the family, Marius has never met his father, Georges Pontmercy. After his father dies, however, Marius learns more about him and comes to admire his father’s democratic politics. Angry with his grandfather, Marius moves out of Gillenormand’s house and lives as a poor young law student. While in law school, Marius associates with a group of radical students, the Friends of the ABC, who are led by the charismatic Enjolras. One day, Marius sees Cosette at a public park. It is love at first sight, but the protective Valjean does his utmost to prevent Cosette and Marius from ever meeting. Their paths cross once again, however, when Valjean makes a charitable visit to Marius’s poor neighbors, the Jondrettes. The Jondrettes are in fact the Thénardiers, who have lost their inn and moved to Paris under an assumed name. After Valjean leaves, Thénardier announces a plan to rob Valjean when he returns. Alarmed, Marius alerts the local police inspector, who turns out to be Javert. The ambush is foiled and the Thénardiers are arrested, but Valjean escapes before Javert can identify him.
Thénardier’s daughter Eponine, who is in love with Marius, helps Marius discover Cosette’s whereabouts. Marius is finally able to make contact with Cosette, and the two declare their love for each other. Valjean, however, soon shatters their happiness. Worried that he will lose Cosette and unnerved by political unrest in the city, Valjean announces that he and Cosette are moving to England. In desperation, Marius runs to his grandfather, M. Gillenormand, to ask for M. Gillenormand’s permission to marry Cosette. Their meeting ends in a bitter argument. When Marius returns to Cosette, she and Valjean have disappeared. Heartbroken, Marius decides to join his radical student friends, who have started a political uprising. Armed with two pistols, Marius heads for the barricades.
The uprising seems doomed, but Marius and his fellow students nonetheless stand their ground and vow to fight for freedom and democracy. The students discover Javert among their ranks, and, realizing that he is a spy, Enjolras ties him up. As the army launches its first attack against the students, Eponine throws herself in front of a rifle to save Marius’s life. As Eponine dies in Marius’s arms, she hands him a letter from Cosette. Marius quickly scribbles a reply and orders a boy, Gavroche, to deliver it to Cosette.
Valjean manages to intercept the note and sets out to save the life of the man his daughter loves. Valjean arrives at the barricade and volunteers to execute Javert. When alone with Javert, however, Valjean instead secretly lets him go free. As the army storms the barricade, Valjean grabs the wounded Marius and flees through the sewers. When Valjean emerges hours later, Javert immediately arrests him. Valjean pleads with Javert to let him take the dying Marius to Marius’s grandfather. Javert agrees. Javert feels tormented, torn between his duty to his profession and the debt he owes Valjean for saving his life. Ultimately, Javert lets Valjean go and throws himself into the river, where he drowns.
Marius makes a full recovery and is reconciled with Gillenormand, who consents to Marius and Cosette’s marriage. Their wedding is a happy one, marred only when Valjean confesses his criminal past to Marius. Alarmed by this revelation and unaware that it was Valjean who saved his life at the barricades, Marius tries to prevent Cosette from having contact with Valjean. Lonely and depressed, Valjean takes to his bed and awaits his death. Marius eventually finds out from Thénardier that Valjean saved Marius’s life. Ashamed that he mistrusted Valjean, Marius tells Cosette everything that has happened. Marius and Cosette rush to Valjean’s side just in time for a final reconciliation. Happy to be reunited with his adopted daughter, Valjean dies in peace."
Moral,"Mitch Albom, the book's narrator, recalls his graduation from Brandeis University in the spring of 1979. After he has received his diploma, Mitch approaches his favorite professor, Morrie Schwartz, and presents him with a monogrammed briefcase. While at Brandeis, Mitch takes almost all of the sociology courses Morrie had teaches. He promises Morrie, who is crying, that he will keep in touch, though he does not fulfill his promise. Years after Mitch's graduation from Brandeis, Morrie is forced to forfeit dancing, his favorite hobby, because he has been diagnosed with ALS, a debilitating disease that leaves his ""soul, perfectly awake, imprisoned inside a limp husk"" of a body. Morrie's wife, Charlotte, cares for Morrie, though at his insistence, keeps her job as a professor at M.I.T.
Sixteen years after his graduation from Brandeis, Mitch is feeling frustrated with the life he has chosen to live. After his uncle dies of pancreatic cancer, Mitch abandons his failing career as a musician to become a well-paid journalist for a Detroit newspaper. Mitch promises his wife Janine that they will have children eventually, though he spends all of his time at work, away on reporting assignments. One night, Mitch is flipping the channels on his television and recognizes Morrie's voice. Morrie is being featured on the television program ""Nightline"" in the first of three interviews with Ted Koppel, whom he quickly befriends. Before consenting to be interviewed, Morrie surprises and softens the famed newscaster when he asks Koppel what is ""close to his heart."" Mitch is stunned to see his former professor on television.
Following Morrie's television appearance, Mitch contacts his beloved professor and travels from his home in Detroit to Morrie's home in West Newton, Massachusetts to visit with him. When Mitch drives up to Morrie's house, he delays greeting his professor because he is speaking on the phone with his producer, a decision he later regrets.
Shortly after his reunion with Morrie, Mitch works himself nearly to death reporting on the Wimbledon tennis tournament in London. There, he spends much time thinking about Morrie and forfeits reading the tabloids, as he now seeks more meaning in his life and knows that he will not gain this meaning from reading about celebrities and gossip. He is knocked over by a swarm of reporters chasing celebrities Andre Agassi and Brooke Shields, and it is then that Mitch realizes he is chasing after the wrong thing. When he returns to his home in Detroit, Mitch learns that the article he has worked so hard to write will not even be published, as the union he belongs to is striking against the newspaper he works for. Once more, Mitch travels to Boston to visit Morrie.
Following their first Tuesday together, Mitch returns regularly every Tuesday to listen to Morrie's lessons on ""The Meaning of Life."" Each week, Mitch brings Morrie food to eat, though as Morrie's condition worsens he is no longer able to enjoy solid food. In his first of three interviews with Koppel for ""Nightline,"" Morrie admits that the thing he dreads most about his worsening condition is that someday, he will not be able to wipe himself after using the bathroom. Eventually, this fear comes true.
Interspersed throughout Mitch's visits to Morrie are flashbacks to their days together at Brandeis. Mitch describes himself as a student who had acted tough, but had sought the tenderness he recognized in Morrie. At Brandeis, Mitch and Morrie shared a relationship more like that between father and son than teacher and student. Soon before Morrie's death, when his condition has deteriorated so much that he can no longer breathe or move on his own, he confides that if he could have another son, he would choose Mitch.
In his childhood, Morrie had been very poor. His father, Charlie had been cold and dispassionate, and had neglected to provide for Morrie and his younger brother emotionally and financially. At the age of eight, Morrie must read the telegram that brings news of his mother's death, as he is the only one in his family who can read English. Charlie marries Eva, a kind woman who gives Morrie and his brother the love and affection they need. Eva also instills in Morrie his love of books and his desire for education. However, Charlie insists that Morrie keep his mother's death a secret, as he wants Morrie's younger brother to believe that Eva is his biological mother. This demand to keep his mother's death a secret proves a terrible emotional burden for young Morrie; he keeps the telegram all of his life as proof that his mother had existed. Because he was starved of love and affection during his childhood, Morrie seeks it out in his old age from his family and friends. Now that he is nearing his death, Morrie says that he has reverted to a figurative infancy, and tries in earnest ""enjoy being a baby again."" He and Mitch often hold hands throughout their sessions together.
In his lessons, Morrie advises Mitch to reject the popular culture in favor of creating his own. The individualistic culture Morrie encourages Mitch to create for himself is a culture founded on love, acceptance, and human goodness, a culture that upholds a set of ethical values unlike the mores that popular culture endorses. Popular culture, Morrie says, is founded on greed, selfishness, and superficiality, which he urges Mitch to overcome. Morrie also stresses that he and Mitch must accept death and aging, as both are inevitable.
On one Tuesday, Janine travels with Mitch to visit Morrie. Janine is a professional singer, and Morrie asks her to sing for him. Though she does not usually sing upon request, Janine concedes, and her voice moves Morrie to tears. Morrie cries freely and often, and continually encourages Mitch to do so also. As Morrie's condition deteriorates, so does that of the pink hibiscus plant that sits on the window ledge in his study. Mitch becomes increasingly aware of the evil in media, as it drenches the country with stories of murder and hatred. One such story is the murder trial of O.J. Simpson, the verdict of which causes major racial division between whites and blacks.
Mitch tape records his discussions with Morrie so that he may compile notes with which to write a book, Tuesdays With Morrie, a project which he and Morrie refer to as their ""last thesis together."" Morrie continually tells Mitch that he wants to share his stories with the world, a the book will allow him to do just that.
Meanwhile, at Morrie's insistence, Mitch attempts to restore his relationship with his brother Peter who lives in Spain. For many years, Peter has refused his family's help in battling pancreatic cancer and insists on seeking treatment alone. Mitch calls Peter and leaves numerous phone messages, though the only reply he receives from his brother is a curt message in which Peter insists he is fine, and reminds Mitch that he does not want to talk about his illness. Morrie prophetizes that Mitch will once more become close with his brother, a prophecy which, after Morrie's death, is realized. At Morrie's funeral, Mitch recalls his promise to continue his conversations with his professor and conducts a silent dialogue with Morrie in his head. Mitch had expected such a dialogue to feel awkward, however this communication feels far more natural than he had ever expected."
Creates,"In a series of letters, Robert Walton, the captain of a ship bound for the North Pole, recounts to his sister back in England the progress of his dangerous mission. Successful early on, the mission is soon interrupted by seas full of impassable ice. Trapped, Walton encounters Victor Frankenstein, who has been traveling by dog-drawn sledge across the ice and is weakened by the cold. Walton takes him aboard ship, helps nurse him back to health, and hears the fantastic tale of the monster that Frankenstein created.
Victor first describes his early life in Geneva. At the end of a blissful childhood spent in the company of Elizabeth Lavenza (his cousin in the 1818 edition, his adopted sister in the 1831 edition) and friend Henry Clerval, Victor enters the university of Ingolstadt to study natural philosophy and chemistry. There, he is consumed by the desire to discover the secret of life and, after several years of research, becomes convinced that he has found it.
Armed with the knowledge he has long been seeking, Victor spends months feverishly fashioning a creature out of old body parts. One climactic night, in the secrecy of his apartment, he brings his creation to life. When he looks at the monstrosity that he has created, however, the sight horrifies him. After a fitful night of sleep, interrupted by the specter of the monster looming over him, he runs into the streets, eventually wandering in remorse. Victor runs into Henry, who has come to study at the university, and he takes his friend back to his apartment. Though the monster is gone, Victor falls into a feverish illness.
Sickened by his horrific deed, Victor prepares to return to Geneva, to his family, and to health. Just before departing Ingolstadt, however, he receives a letter from his father informing him that his youngest brother, William, has been murdered. Grief-stricken, Victor hurries home. While passing through the woods where William was strangled, he catches sight of the monster and becomes convinced that the monster is his brother’s murderer. Arriving in Geneva, Victor finds that Justine Moritz, a kind, gentle girl who had been adopted by the Frankenstein household, has been accused. She is tried, condemned, and executed, despite her assertions of innocence. Victor grows despondent, guilty with the knowledge that the monster he has created bears responsibility for the death of two innocent loved ones.
Hoping to ease his grief, Victor takes a vacation to the mountains. While he is alone one day, crossing an enormous glacier, the monster approaches him. The monster admits to the murder of William but begs for understanding. Lonely, shunned, and forlorn, he says that he struck out at William in a desperate attempt to injure Victor, his cruel creator. The monster begs Victor to create a mate for him, a monster equally grotesque to serve as his sole companion.
Victor refuses at first, horrified by the prospect of creating a second monster. The monster is eloquent and persuasive, however, and he eventually convinces Victor. After returning to Geneva, Victor heads for England, accompanied by Henry, to gather information for the creation of a female monster. Leaving Henry in Scotland, he secludes himself on a desolate island in the Orkneys and works reluctantly at repeating his first success. One night, struck by doubts about the morality of his actions, Victor glances out the window to see the monster glaring in at him with a frightening grin. Horrified by the possible consequences of his work, Victor destroys his new creation. The monster, enraged, vows revenge, swearing that he will be with Victor on Victor’s wedding night.
Later that night, Victor takes a boat out onto a lake and dumps the remains of the second creature in the water. The wind picks up and prevents him from returning to the island. In the morning, he finds himself ashore near an unknown town. Upon landing, he is arrested and informed that he will be tried for a murder discovered the previous night. Victor denies any knowledge of the murder, but when shown the body, he is shocked to behold his friend Henry Clerval, with the mark of the monster’s fingers on his neck. Victor falls ill, raving and feverish, and is kept in prison until his recovery, after which he is acquitted of the crime.
Shortly after returning to Geneva with his father, Victor marries Elizabeth. He fears the monster’s warning and suspects that he will be murdered on his wedding night. To be cautious, he sends Elizabeth away to wait for him. While he awaits the monster, he hears Elizabeth scream and realizes that the monster had been hinting at killing his new bride, not himself. Victor returns home to his father, who dies of grief a short time later. Victor vows to devote the rest of his life to finding the monster and exacting his revenge, and he soon departs to begin his quest.
Victor tracks the monster ever northward into the ice. In a dogsled chase, Victor almost catches up with the monster, but the sea beneath them swells and the ice breaks, leaving an unbridgeable gap between them. At this point, Walton encounters Victor, and the narrative catches up to the time of Walton’s fourth letter to his sister.
Walton tells the remainder of the story in another series of letters to his sister. Victor, already ill when the two men meet, worsens and dies shortly thereafter. When Walton returns, several days later, to the room in which the body lies, he is startled to see the monster weeping over Victor. The monster tells Walton of his immense solitude, suffering, hatred, and remorse. He asserts that now that his creator has died, he too can end his suffering. The monster then departs for the northernmost ice to die."
Enforce,"Lawyer Bryan Stevenson gives a first-person account of his decades helping marginalized Americans who have been unfairly and harshly punished by the U.S. criminal justice system, which disproportionately targets people of color and poor people. At the heart of Just Mercy is the story of Walter McMillian, a Black man who was framed for the murder of a girl named Ronda Morrison, convicted, and sent to death row. 
Stevenson alternates chapters about Walter with his personal reflections on our country’s history with racial disparity and issues around incarceration. Stevenson highlights other groups of vulnerable people who have been victimized by the criminal justice system and shares the stories of the prisoners he has helped over the years. The book also follows the growth of Stevenson’s nonprofit law project, the Alabama-based Equal Justice Initiative (EJI), through its expansion from focusing on death row prisoners to helping people sentenced to life without parole. Stevenson chronicles how EJI becomes a significant force in criminal justice reform.
In 1983 as a law student, Stevenson discovers his life’s passion when he interns with the Georgia-based Southern Prisoners Defense Committee and meets his first death row prisoner. After graduation Stevenson accepts a job with the organization to represent poor prisoners, including those in Alabama who lack any public defender. He meets Walter McMillian on Alabama’s death row. Walter owns a successful business but also transgresses racial boundaries when he has an affair with a white woman. Soon after the affair becomes public, the woman’s friend, Ralph Myers, accuses Walter of committing the unsolved murder of Ronda Morrison, which has outraged the community. Law enforcement, including a racist sheriff and the district attorney, eagerly pounces on this accusation, overlooking Walter’s alibi and a lack of evidence. Instead, they actively force Ralph to stick with his story even when he tries to recant. They coerce other false witness testimonies, and—as revealed years later—actively suppress evidence.
After Stevenson and the team at EJI unsuccessfully appeal Walter’s conviction, they launch their own investigation of the crime and uncover new evidence. They find witnesses who can prove the witnesses against Walter lied as well as financial records that indicate that one of these witnesses was paid to give false testimony. Stevenson and his team also petition for and receive all records from Walter’s trial. However, their big break comes when they receive a phone call from Ralph, who now wants to make amends. Ralph admits to lying about Walter and says he was threatened by law enforcement. Stevenson wins a hearing for Walter where he can present his new evidence: Ralph’s testimony, which is confirmed by health care workers and other inmates, as well as recordings of the law enforcement team threatening Ralph if he doesn’t frame Walter. 
While the judge refuses to grant Walter relief, Stevenson continues the appeal process through the Alabama courts. The district attorney asks outside agents to investigate the murder for which Walter was convicted, and the investigators determine that Walter had nothing to do with the crime. Six weeks later, the court invalidates Walter’s conviction. Stevenson and the State file a joint motion to dismiss the charges, and Walter is set free.
Throughout the process, Stevenson and Walter become close friends, and Stevenson helps Walter upon his release, including filing a civil suit on his behalf and offering him a place to stay. Walter works with Stevenson to share his story, giving interviews and speaking at legal conferences, and Walter is even featured in a documentary. Unfortunately, Walter is diagnosed with advancing dementia and is forced to rely on family and eventually a nursing facility for his care. He dies in 2013. Stevenson gives a eulogy at his funeral and shares all he learned from Walter, particularly that we must extend mercy to everyone, even those who have not earned it.
Interspersed with chapters chronicling Walter’s narrative are stories of Stevenson’s other clients and work. His closeness with these prisoners and their horrifying circumstances makes Stevenson more determined to help and causes him to reflect on abstract issues that nevertheless imbue the criminal justice system, like humanity and mercy. Stevenson focuses on several categories of vulnerable people who become trapped in the system, including mentally ill prisoners, disabled prisoners, and poor women who give birth to stillborn babies. 
Stevenson and his team at EJI also become increasingly focused on juvenile offenders who are sometimes tried as adults despite their young age. These offenders may be given de facto death sentences by being sentenced to life without parole and face perilous circumstances when they are housed in adult prisons. Stevenson illustrates how these prisoners retain their own humanity while being forced to live under inhumane conditions. He also discusses some of the qualities common among these types of prisoners: They are generally poor and disproportionately people of color, and most of them lack adequate legal counsel. The juveniles have horrific backgrounds of abuse and neglect.
Stevenson and his team at EJI also work to change the legal system to offer more protection to marginalized people. Several of his cases end up before the U.S. Supreme Court, and he succeeds in winning rulings that ban as unconstitutional the conviction of children to life without parole and the execution of people deemed incompetent from dementia or neurological disease. EJI works to raise public awareness of issues surrounding unfair incarceration, produces groundbreaking reports on racial issues, and sets up programs to help formerly incarcerated people adjust to life on the outside.
Stevenson also reflects on the issues that surround the criminal justice system. His time spent with prisoners awaiting their execution makes him realize how inhumane it is to prepare another human to die. After decades of work, when Stevenson fails to prevent the execution of a man who suffers from an intellectual disability, he momentarily feels unable to continue his work. However, he realizes that he cannot help but be broken by his experiences and comes to understand that it is his own brokenness that allows him to more fully understand the need for mercy and to bring compassion to others. The book ends with Stevenson’s renewed commitment to helping others."

Stevenson and his team at EJI also work to change the legal system to offer more protection to marginalized people. Several of his cases end up before the U.S. Supreme Court, and he succeeds in winning rulings that ban as unconstitutional the conviction of children to life without parole and the execution of people deemed incompetent from dementia or neurological disease. EJI works to raise public awareness of issues surrounding unfair incarceration, produces groundbreaking reports on racial issues, and sets up programs to help formerly incarcerated people adjust to life on the outside.
Stevenson also reflects on the issues that surround the criminal justice system. His time spent with prisoners awaiting their execution makes him realize how inhumane it is to prepare another human to die. After decades of work, when Stevenson fails to prevent the execution of a man who suffers from an intellectual disability, he momentarily feels unable to continue his work. However, he realizes that he cannot help but be broken by his experiences and comes to understand that it is his own brokenness that allows him to more fully understand the need for mercy and to bring compassion to others. The book ends with Stevenson’s renewed commitment to helping others."
Catastrophe,"Oryx and Crake opens with a man named Snowman waking up in a tree. Some kind of catastrophic event has taken place, but the reader does not yet know what the event was or what caused the event. It appears that Snowman may be the sole survivor of the event, aside from a group of childlike people he refers to as the “Children of Crake,” who walk around naked and clearly have a unique genetic composition.
		
The post-apocalyptic world represents the novel’s present time, and each chapter of the book moves back and forth between Snowman’s present experiences and his memories of his pre-apocalypse life, when he went by the name Jimmy. These separate but connected narrative threads weave together as the book moves along.
In the present-time narrative, Snowman watches over the Children of Crake, or the “Crakers,” to whom he feels a sense of responsibility. Snowman spins fictional stories about individuals named Crake and Oryx, whom the Crakers understand as kinds of gods: whereas Crake watches over the Crakers, Oryx presides over the lives and well-being of plants and animals.
Though the Crakers appear well adapted to the post-apocalyptic environment, Snowman struggles to keep himself fed and hydrated. He knows where he can find more much-needed supplies, but the location is far away, and he’s never left the Crakers for more than a day. Nevertheless, he decides to make the dangerous journey. After informing the Crakers, he sets off for the Paradice facility in the RejoovenEsense Compound, where he once worked alongside Crake.
On his journey to Paradice, Snowman encounters several threats, including a herd of cunning and dangerous genetically engineered animals called pigoons. Though Snowman is slowed down by an infected foot wound, he eventually reaches Paradice, where he gathers crucial supplies. With his booty in tow, he limps back to the Crakers.
Although Snowman’s narrative functions as a frame for the novel, the majority of the book focuses on Snowman’s memories of his prior self, Jimmy. This narrative begins with Jimmy’s boyhood. His parents worked at a company called OrganInc Farms, which researched ways to grow human organs cheaply and effectively. Jimmy’s mother grew increasingly disgusted by the company’s work, which caused friction with her husband. She suffered a long period of depression, and soon after her husband got a high-status new job, she ran away, abandoning Jimmy.
Jimmy suffered greatly after his mother’s disappearance. However, he survived through a blossoming friendship with a new student at HelthWyzer High named Crake, with whom he spent a lot of time watching graphic videos of sex and violence on the internet. Whereas Jimmy lacked an aptitude for math and science, Crake proved himself gifted in both disciplines. After they graduated, Crake went off to the prestigious Watson-Crick Institute, where he majored in bioengineering. He graduated early and soon began to lead his own research projects.
Meanwhile, Jimmy attended a lower-tier school specializing in the arts and humanities. There he majored in a program called Problematics, which prepared him for a career in advertising. After graduating, Jimmy started working for a company called AnooYoo, where he applied his dissertation research on twentieth-century self-help manuals to marketing campaigns for self-improvement products. Although Crake and Jimmy kept up with and occasionally visited each other, their communications dwindled as the years progressed.
Occasionally during his years at AnooYoo, employees of an agency called the CorpSeCorps came to Jimmy’s apartment to interrogate him about his mother’s whereabouts, but Jimmy had long since lost contact with her. In his fifth year at AnooYoo, the agents came again and showed Jimmy a video of his mother’s execution. The news of his mother’s death sent Jimmy into a profound depression, which only came to an end when Crake showed up at his apartment and asked Jimmy to come work with him at RejoovenEsense. Jimmy accepted the job, which involved running an ad campaign for a new pill called BlyssPluss that Crake had designed to improve users’ libido while simultaneously (and secretly) making them unable to have children. Crake presided over an additional top-secret project located in a special facility called Paradice, which housed a new breed of genetically engineered humans: the Crakers.
At Paradice, Jimmy met a woman named Oryx, whom Crake had hired to teach the Crakers and to help distribute the BlyssPluss pills worldwide. Jimmy recognized Oryx from a child pornography video that he and Crake had seen when they were teenagers. Crake had met Oryx in person when he was in college and employed her for sex work. Oryx and Crake developed a relationship, and when Crake started at RejoovenEsense, he hired Oryx to work there too. Oryx seduced Jimmy, and Jimmy worried that Crake would feel jealous if he found out. One night, when Crake was away from the facility and Oryx was picking up takeout, news reports started coming in about simultaneous plague outbreaks unfolding around the world. Oryx called Jimmy to explain that the BlyssPluss pills contained a delayed-release contagion, and that she had unwittingly participated in the outbreak. Crake’s plague spread quickly and killed the majority of people on the planet.
In the first hours of the outbreak, Crake returned to Paradice with Oryx in tow, and he slit her throat in front of Jimmy. Jimmy then shot Crake. For the first few weeks after the outbreak, Jimmy remained locked in the Paradice facility alone, searching for reasons that Crake would kill Oryx. Eventually, he introduced himself to the Crakers as “Snowman” and led them to a new home near the ocean, where they still live in the novel’s present time.
The novel ends with Snowman’s present-time journey from Paradice back to the Crakers. When he arrives, the Crakers inform him that they saw a group of people like him in the area. Snowman tracks down the other humans and wonders whether to approach them as friends or foes."
Enjoy,"The interrelated short stories in Love Medicine span half a century, with various narrators taking turns telling the stories. In 1934, Marie Lazarre, age fourteen, leaves home to live at Sacred Heart Convent, a school on a hill in town. A perverted nun, Sister Leopolda, considers Marie evil and tortures her, culminating in scalding her with boiling water and stabbing her hand with a fork. As Marie flees, she runs into a boy named Nector Kashpaw who thinks Marie has stolen from the convent. Nector, good with money, thinks he might get a reward if he catches Marie. They argue, tussle, and have sex. Marie and Nector go on to have a long marriage, many children, and many challenges. These events happen in “Saint Marie” and “Wild Geese.”
In “The Beads,” it is 1948 and nine-year-old June Morrissey comes to live with Marie and Nector Kashpaw after her mother dies in the woods. Filthy and malnourished, June thrives under Marie’s care. A child of the woods, June grows close to her Uncle Eli, a recluse, and goes to live with him.
Three stories—“Lulu’s Boys,” “The Plunge of the Brave,” and “Flesh and Blood”—are narrated in 1957, but each offers events and details from both the past and present. Lulu Lamartine’s husband, Henry, dies when a train hits his car, and Lulu has sex with Henry’s brother, Bev, resulting in the birth of their son, Henry Junior. Several years later, Bev visits Lulu to claim Henry Junior as his own, but he falls in love with Lulu despite his marriage to Elsa. 
In “The Plunge of the Brave,” Nector Kashpaw narrates his story, beginning in the 1930s. As a young man, he played in Hollywood Western films and modeled for a famous painting called The Plunge of the Brave. After marrying Marie, seventeen years go by, filled with babies, drinking, gambling, work, and tribal leadership. In 1952, Nector realizes that he still pines for Lulu, whom he loved as a teenager. He reconnects with her and they make love, leading to weekly trysts for five years. When Nector decides to leave Marie, he pens two letters. The letter to Lulu accidentally leads to burning Lulu’s house down when Nector lets a lit cigarette ignite it. On the same day, in “Flesh and Blood,” Marie discovers the letter saying that Nector is leaving her for Lulu. Marie finds the letter in her kitchen after she visits the dying Sister Leopolda. However, when Nector later returns home, Marie realizes that he is staying and hides the letter again without mentioning that she found it in the first place.
Lyman Lamartine narrates “The Red Convertible” in 1973, but the story begins in 1970 when Lyman and Henry Junior buy a red convertible and go on a road trip to Alaska. When they return, Henry Junior is drafted and ends up in a Vietnamese prison, returning with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Before he goes home, Henry Junior meets young Albertine Johnson in Fargo. They have sex, but Henry Junior gets drunk and loses his senses. He explodes, screams, and weeps as “The Bridge” ends. Back at home, Henry Junior is jumpy and mean. Lyman deliberately damages the convertible to give Henry Junior a reason to live as he hoped Henry Junior would be interested in repairing the car. However, when the brothers drive to the Red River, they drink too much, Henry Junior turns morose, and they fight. After Henry Junior jumps into the river and drowns, Lyman pushes the car into the water and watches it sink.
The next cluster of stories are narrated from 1980 to 1984. Albertine Johnson and Dot Nanapush work at a truck weighing station together in “Scales.” Gerry, Dot’s husband, escapes from prison but is arrested again. Dot gives birth to their daughter, and Gerry is sent to a maximum-security prison for shooting a state trooper. June Morrissey dies on Easter Sunday while walking in the snow after a sexual encounter. Her niece, Albertine, goes home a week after her funeral and witnesses a violent night of drinking and fighting that involves King, Lynette, Marie, Nector, Lipsha, Gordie, and baby King Junior. Gordie, who has been separated from June for some time, starts drinking heavily, feeling guilty and responsible for her death. He hallucinates visits from June, lost in a fog of alcohol-induced psychosis. When Gordie hits a deer in “Crown of Thorns,” he thinks he has hit June. He goes to the convent to confess “killing his wife” and meets Sister Mary Martin who sees the deer in the backseat of the car, not a woman. 
The final cluster of events focuses on Lipsha Morrissey who was adopted by Marie and Nector as a young child. Lipsha carries magic in him and has a healing touch. He serves as an attendant in the Senior Citizens home, now the residence of Marie, Nector, and Lulu. Lipsha walks in on Lulu and Nector having sex in the laundry room, indicating that Nector still lusts for her. Lipsha agrees to help Marie reclaim Nector’s heart with “love medicine.” When he misses shooting wild geese to use their hearts for the medicine, he buys frozen turkeys as a shortcut. However, Nector chokes and dies when he eats the turkey heart. Family and friends attend Grandpa Nector’s funeral, and Nector’s spirit visits Marie. Lipsha explains to Marie that Nector loved her and releases the man’s spirit. Despite Lulu’s affair with Nector, Marie and Lulu become friends when Marie agrees to help Lulu recover from eye surgery. 
In the final story, Lulu tells Lipsha who his biological parents are: his mother was June Morrissey and his father was Gerry Nanapush. Lipsha journeys to a border town where he joins the army and envisions that Gerry will escape prison yet again. He leaves the army and drives to see King, whom he now knows is his half-brother, and finds him with Lynette and King Junior. As the men play poker, the TV announces Gerry’s escape. Gerry soon appears because King snitched on him while they were in prison and he’s angry about it. When the police show up to arrest Gerry, he escapes. After Lipsha demands King’s car, which Lipsha won in a game of poker, he discovers his father, Gerry, in the trunk. Lipsha helps Gerry cross the border and escape the police. After, Lipsha accepts who he is and emotionally releases his parents while standing on a bridge over a river, ready to return to the reservation."
Skirts,"Marjane “Marji” Satrapi is an intelligent, spirited, and very modern girl living with her parents in Iran’s capital of Tehran during the eventful period of Iranian history from the late 1970s into the early 1980s. In Persepolis: The Story of a Childhood, Marji’s remembers her life during those years, mostly from when she was about ten to age fourteen. This account includes how Marji and her family lived through and were affected by turbulent events that included the overthrow of the autocratic Shah of Iran by the Islamic revolution, the oppressive fundamentalist regime that replaced the Shah, and the devasting Iran-Iraq war.
The nation’s wealth has long made it a target of outside invaders, but Islamic revolution of 1979 has pushed out the Western-backed government of the Shah.  The revolution has ushered in a new Islamic regime that is bringing massive societal changes impacting how people are supposed to behave--including Marji and her family. Marji struggles to adjust to the changes at her liberal French bilingual school, which has become increasingly stricter. Girls are required to wear veils and female and male students are now separated. Marji’s wealthy and modern parents—her father, Ebi, and her mother, Taji—take part in the massive protests against the new regime’s strict rules on behavior (just as they had previously protested against the Shah’s regime). Marji’s parents worry when a photo of Marji’s mother a protest appears in newspapers magazines. Later, after a demonstration they are at turns violent, the Satrapis decide that openly protesting is too dangerous to continue to do.
Marji feels conflict between her own deeply spiritual feelings and the stark modernism of her parents. She talks to God at night and has believed she will become a prophet one day since she was six years old, Marji. But the revolution leads to Marji setting aside these ambitions while she studies and imitates protestors and revolutionaries. She mimics protestors in the garden of her house and studies books about famous revolutionaries and philosophers given to her by her parents. She fantasizes about becoming a hero and wants her parents to become heroes too. Marji’s relationship with God becomes strained, as she finds that she and God have less to talk about—although God does still come by to see her from time to time.
Marji thrills when she learns that rebels fill her family history. She learns that her grandfather was a prince and later a communist whom the Shah removed from power and that her uncle Anoosh, also a communist, spent nine years in prison during the Shah’s regime. Marji spends a short time with Anoosh, learning about his life. After the Shah fell from power in 1979, Anoosh was released from prison, but when Islamic fundamentalists consolidate their grip on power, they hunt Anoosh down, imprison him, and later execute him. Her new idol killed, Marji feels crushed. She completely abandons her faith in God and increasingly questions the pro-regime propaganda she hears—especially at school.
Marji deeply loves and identifies with of her parents, even if she does sometimes feel that their actions and behavior (as wealthy and privileged individuals) do not always live up to their pro-democratic and liberal rhetoric. Marji also has a special connection with her grandmother, who remains stoic and inspiring to Marji in spite of the turmoil and numerous tragedies stemming from political actions that impact her and the family. Marji’s uncle Anoosh is not Marji’s only direct experience with the cruel consequences of the government’s actions. Throughout the book, death and devastation occurs among Marji’s extended family and friends as direct results of the brutality and fanaticism of the Iranian regimes and the war with Iraq.
People had rejoiced when the Shah was forced out, but as Islamic fundamentalists retain power, Marji and her family watch as their neighbors’ behavior shifts back and forth to coincide with the current political winds. The neighbors go from wearing short skirts and drinking alcohol to covering themselves and denouncing the use of alcohol. Marji’s parents ask her to tell everyone that she prays every day, a lie they hope will keep Marji safe, but acknowledge that the rules seem foolish. Marji grows more rebellious, as she increasingly views the rules at school and elsewhere as hypocritical and difficult to follow. Armed with more knowledge and personal experience, Marji begins to act out in ways that put her safety at risk. In fact, she even (accidentally) hits her principal during an argument, which results in her expulsion from school. Fearing her rebellious behavior will get her killed, Marji’s mother tries to reason with Marji by telling her that it is not her responsibility to serve justice and that the bad guys eventually pay for their sins in the end.
The war with Iraq had originally inspired Marji to vocal patriotism in protection her country against another invasion, but Marji begins to realize there are greater forces behind the war. She sees how the Islamic regime needs the war to continue survive and keep power. The war promotes a sense of nationalism and pride in the public, and those who die in the war are hailed as “martyrs.” Marji sees thousands of poor boys lured into war without proper training. She becomes increasingly uncomfortable and aware of class differences within society. Poor young boys are lured into the army with gold-painted keys to the “kingdom of heaven” to help them enter paradise after dying on the battlefield, while children in her wealthy neighborhood are left alone.
More and more people try to escape Iran as the borders tighten and Iraqi forces bomb Tehran and other Iranian cities. Realizing that Marji’s chances of escaping Iran are narrowing, her parents make the difficult decision to send her abroad alone to finish school in Vienna, explaining that only a good education will free her of Iran. Marji feels heartbroken. She spends one last night with her grandmother, who gives her warm advice and inspires her to be compassionate and understanding while in Vienna. Marji gives away all of her prized contraband to her friends, including a Kim Wilde poster. At the airport, as Marji turns to say goodbye to her parents one last time to see that her mother, devasted by her only child’s departure, has fainted."
Drafted,"The protagonist, who is named Tim O’Brien, begins by describing an event that occurred in the middle of his Vietnam experience. “The Things They Carried” catalogs the variety of things his fellow soldiers in the Alpha Company brought on their missions. Several of these things are intangible, including guilt and fear, while others are specific physical objects, including matches, morphine, M-16 rifles, and M&M’s candy.
Throughout the collection, the same characters reappear in various stories. The first member of the Alpha Company to die is Ted Lavender, a “grunt,” or low-ranking soldier, who deals with his anxiety about the war by taking tranquilizers and smoking marijuana. Lavender is shot in the head on his way back from going to the bathroom, and his superior, Lieutenant Jimmy Cross, blames himself for the tragedy. When Lavender is shot, Cross is distracting himself with thoughts of Martha, a college crush. It is revealed in “Love” that Cross’s feelings for Martha, whom he dated once before leaving for Vietnam, were never reciprocated, and that even twenty years after the war, his guilt over Lavender’s death remains.
In “On the Rainy River,” the narrator, O’Brien, explains the series of events that led him to Vietnam in the first place. He receives his draft notice in June of 1968, and his feelings of confusion drive him north to the Canadian border, which he contemplates crossing so that he will not be forced to fight in a war in which he doesn’t believe. Sitting in a rowboat with the proprietor of the Tip Top Lodge, where he stays, O’Brien decides that his guilt about avoiding the war and fear of disappointing his family are more important than his political convictions. He soon leaves, going first back home to Worthington, Minnesota and later to Vietnam.
In addition to Ted Lavender, a few other members of the Alpha Company are killed during their mission overseas, including Curt Lemon, who is killed when he steps on a rigged mortar round. Though O’Brien is not close to Lemon, in “The Dentist,” he tells a story of how Lemon, who faints before a routine checkup with an army-issued dentist, tries to save face by insisting that a perfectly good tooth be pulled. Lee Strunk, another member of the company, dies from injuries he sustains by stepping on a landmine. In “Friends,” O’Brien remembers that before Strunk was fatally hurt, Strunk and Dave Jensen had made a pact that if either man were irreparably harmed, the other man would see that he was quickly killed. However, when Strunk is actually hurt, he begs Jensen to spare him, and Jensen complies. Instead of being upset by the news of his friend’s swift death en route to treatment, Jensen is relieved.
The death that receives the most attention in The Things They Carried is that of Kiowa, a much-loved member of the Alpha Company and one of O’Brien’s closest friends. In “Speaking of Courage,” the story of Kiowa’s death is relayed in retrospect through the memory of Norman Bowker, years after the war. As Bowker drives around a lake in his Iowa hometown, he thinks that he failed to save Kiowa, who was killed when a mortar round hit and caused him to sink headfirst into a marshy field. O’Brien realizes that he has dealt with his guilt over Kiowa’s death differently than Norman Bowker in “Notes.” Just before the end of the war, O’Brien receives a long letter from Bowker that says he hasn’t found a way to make life meaningful after the war. O’Brien resolves to tell Bowker’s story, and the story of Kiowa’s death, in order to negotiate his own feelings of guilt and hollowness.
Like “Love” and “Notes,” several of O’Brien’s stories are told from a perspective twenty years after the Vietnam War, when he is a forty-three-year-old writer living in Massachusetts. Exposure to the guilt of old friends like Jimmy Cross and Norman Bowker prompts him to write stories in order to understand what they were going through. But two stories, “The Man I Killed” and “Ambush,” are written so that O’Brien can confront his own guilt over killing a man with a grenade outside the village of My Khe. In “The Man I Killed,” O’Brien imagines the life of his victim, from his childhood to the way things would have turned out for him had O’Brien not spotted him on a path and thrown a grenade at his feet. In “Ambush,” O’Brien imagines how he might relay the story of the man he killed to his nine-year-old daughter, Kathleen. In this second story, O’Brien provides more details of the actual killing—including the sound of the grenade and his own feelings—and explains that even well after the fact, he hasn’t finished sorting out the experience.
In the last story, “The Lives of the Dead,” O’Brien gives another twist to his contention that stories have the power to save people. In the stories of Curt Lemon and Kiowa, O’Brien explains that his imagination allowed him to grapple successfully with his guilt and confusion over the death of his fourth-grade first love, Linda."
Americaâ,"On a lovely day in May, 1868, Christopher Newman, a wealthy American businessman, sits down in the Louvre with an aesthetic headache, having seen too many paintings. A young Parisian copyist, Noémie Nioche, catches his eye, and he agrees to buy the painting she is working on for the extravagant price of 2,000 francs.
Shortly thereafter, Newman recognizes Tom Tristram, an old friend from the Civil War, wandering the gallery. Newman explains that he has made quite a fortune and now, having realized the inanity of seeking competitive revenge on his fellow businessmen, has decided to move to Europe to enjoy his wealth.
Over dinner, Newman admits to the Tristrams that he has come to Europe to find a wife to complete his fortune. Mrs. Tristram suggests Claire de Cintré, the beautiful and widowed daughter of an impossibly aristocratic family, the Bellegardes. Several days later, Newman stops by the Tristram house only to find the visiting Claire, who politely invites him to call on her. When Newman stops by the Bellegarde home, a pleasant young man promises to go get Claire, but is checked by an imposing older figure who claims she is not at home.
Shortly thereafter, M. Nioche, Noémie's father, appears at Newman's hotel with his daughter's heavily varnished and framed picture. When the timid, bankrupt Nioche admits his fear that his beautiful daughter will come to a bad end, Newman offers to let her earn a modest dowry by painting. When he meets Noémie in the Louvre to commission the paintings, however, she tells him bluntly that she cannot paint and will only marry if she can do so very well.
Mrs. Tristram encourages Newman to spend the summer traveling, promising that Claire will wait for his return. Newman spends a wonderful summer exploring ruins, monuments, cathedrals, and the countryside with his usual enthusiasm. On his return to Paris in the fall, Newman calls on Claire and finds her at home with her brother Valentin, the pleasant young man he met on the first visit. Newman is deeply drawn to Claire's presence, her peace, and her intense yet mild eyes.
About a week later, Valentin calls on Newman at home. The two talk late into the night and soon become fast friends. Valentin explains to Newman that Claire was married at eighteen, against her will, to the disagreeable old Count de Cintré. Valentin tried to stop the wedding, but his mother, the Marquise and his brother, Urbain—the imposing older figure who barred Newman's first visit—coveted the Count's pedigree and fortune. When the Count died and his questionable business practices were exposed, Claire was so horrified that she withdrew her claim to his money. The Marquise and Urbain allowed this withdrawal on the condition that Claire obey them completely for ten years on every issue but marriage.
Newman tells Valentin that he would like to marry Claire. Valentin promises to help Newman's cause, out of both friendship and a spirit of mischief. The following day, Newman calls on Claire and finds her alone. He frankly details his love, his assets, and his desire to marry her. Fascinated but hesitant, Claire tells him she has decided not to marry, but agrees to get to know him if he promises not to speak of marriage for six months.
Delighted by Newman's success, Valentin arranges an audience with the heads of the family—the forbidding Marquise and Urbain—later that week. On the appointed evening, after some painful small talk, Newman horrifies the assembled company with a long and candid speech about his poor adolescence and the makings of his fortune. When the others have left for a ball, Newman bluntly tells the Marquise that he would like to marry her daughter. After inquiring with equal frankness about his wealth, the Marquise grudgingly agrees to consider his proposal.
Several days later, M. Nioche unexpectedly appears at Newman's hotel room, clearly worried about Noémie's antics. Newman decides to visit Noémie at the Louvre to discern the trouble. He encounters Valentin en route and brings him along. Valentin, completely charmed by Noémie and her ruthless, sublime ambition, resolves to pursue her. Shortly thereafter, Newman receives an invitation to dinner at the Bellegarde house. After dinner, Urbain confirms that the family has decided to accept Newman as a candidate for Claire's hand.
Over the next six weeks Newman comes often to the Bellegarde house, more than content to haunt Claire's rooms and attend her parties. One afternoon as he awaits Claire, Newman is approached by Mrs. Bread, the Bellegardes' old English maid, who secretly encourages him in his courtship. Meanwhile, the Bellegardes' long-lost cousin Lord Deepmere arrives in Paris.
Upon the expiration of the six-month period of silence about marriage, Newman proposes to Claire again, and she accepts. The next day, Mrs. Bread warns Newman to lose no time in getting married. The Marquise is evidently displeased by the engagement, but agrees to throw an engagement ball. The following few days are the happiest in Newman's life, as he sees Claire every day, exchanging longing glances and tender words. Meanwhile, the Marquise and Urbain are away, taking Deepmere on a tour of Paris.
On the night of the Bellegarde ball, Newman suffers endless introductions gladly and feels elated. He surprises first the Marquis and then Claire in heated discussions with Lord Deepmere, but thinks little of it. Afterwards, he and Claire exchange declarations of happiness.
Shortly thereafter, Newman attends a performance of the opera Don Giovanni, and sees that several of his acquaintances are also there. During the second act, Valentin and Stanislas Kapp, who have both been sitting in Noémie's box, exchange insults and agree to a duel as a point of honor. Noémie is thrilled, knowing that being dueled over will do wonders for her social standing. Against Newman's protests, Valentin leaves for the duel, which is held just over the Swiss border.
The next morning, Newman arrives at the Bellegardes' to find Claire's carriage packed. In great distress, Claire confesses that she can no longer marry him. The Marquise and Urbain admit that they have interfered, unable to accept the idea that a commercial person should marry into their family. Newman visits Mrs. Tristram, who guesses that the Bellegardes want Claire to marry the rich Lord Deepmere instead, though the honest Deepmere ruined things by telling Claire everything at the ball. Returning home to a note that Valentin has been mortally wounded in the duel, Newman packs his bags and heads for the Swiss border.
Newman arrives in Geneva to find Valentin near death. When Newman reluctantly recounts the broken engagement with Claire, Valentin formally apologizes for his family and tells Newman to ask Mrs. Bread about a skeleton in the Bellegarde family closet that Newman can use to get revenge. Newman attends Valentin's funeral, but cannot bear to watch the actual burial and leaves. Three days later, he calls on Claire at the family château in Fleurières, hoping to extract a rational justification for her rejection. But she hides behind dark hints of a curse on the family, ruing her own vain attempts at happiness and declaring her intention to become a Carmelite nun.
Newman threatens the Bellegardes with his superficial knowledge of their secret, but they refuse to budge. That night, Newman secretly meets Mrs. Bread, who tells him the full secret—the Marquise and Urbain killed the Marquis, Claire's father, at the family's country home because he opposed Claire's first marriage to the Comte de Cintré. Mrs. Bread gives Newman a secret testament to these circumstances that the Marquis wrote just before he died.
The next week in Paris, Mrs. Bread comes to work for Newman as his housekeeper. Newman goes to mass at the Carmelite convent, but, horrified by the nuns' joyless chanting, he leaves. After the service, he confronts the Marquise and Urbain with the details of their crime and a copy of the Marquis' letter. The Bellegardes are clearly stunned, but regain their composure and leave. The next morning, Urbain visits Newman to ask his price for destroying the note. Newman wants Claire, but Urbain refuses to give her. The two part in stalemate.
Newman decides to ruin the Bellegardes by telling all their friends about the murder. But when Newman calls on a rich Duchess, the first person he intends to tell, he is overwhelmed by the folly of his errand. Instead, he leaves for London to think. One day in Hyde Park, Newman see Noémie on Lord Deepmere's arm, attended by her miserable father.
After several months in London, Newman returns to the States. He makes it to San Francisco before the weight of his unfinished business in France becomes unbearable. Returning to Paris, Newman walks to Claire's convent and finds only a high, blank wall. Realizing that Claire is completely lost to him, Newman destroys the Marquis' incriminatory note in Mrs. Tristram's fireplace and packs his bags for America."
Duties,"A Doll’s House opens on Christmas Eve. Nora Helmer enters her well-furnished living room—the setting of the entire play—carrying several packages. Torvald Helmer, Nora’s husband, comes out of his study when he hears her arrive. He greets her playfully and affectionately, but then chides her for spending so much money on Christmas gifts. Their conversation reveals that the Helmers have had to be careful with money for many years, but that Torvald has recently obtained a new position at the bank where he works that will afford them a more comfortable lifestyle.
Helene, the maid, announces that the Helmers’ dear friend Dr. Rank has come to visit. At the same time, another visitor has arrived, this one unknown. To Nora’s great surprise, Kristine Linde, a former school friend, comes into the room. The two have not seen each other for years, but Nora mentions having read that Mrs. Linde’s husband passed away a few years earlier. Mrs. Linde tells Nora that when her husband died, she was left with no money and no children. Nora tells Mrs. Linde about her first year of marriage to Torvald. She explains that they were very poor and both had to work long hours. Torvald became sick, she adds, and the couple had to travel to Italy so that Torvald could recover.
Nora inquires further about Mrs. Linde’s life, and Mrs. Linde explains that for years she had to care for her sick mother and her two younger brothers. She states that her mother has passed away, though, and that the brothers are too old to need her. Instead of feeling relief, Mrs. Linde says she feels empty because she has no occupation; she hopes that Torvald may be able to help her obtain employment. Nora promises to speak to Torvald and then reveals a great secret to Mrs. Linde—without Torvald’s knowledge, Nora illegally borrowed money for the trip that she and Torvald took to Italy; she told Torvald that the money had come from her father. For years, Nora reveals, she has worked and saved in secret, slowly repaying the debt, and soon it will be fully repaid.
Krogstad, a low-level employee at the bank where Torvald works, arrives and proceeds into Torvald’s study. Nora reacts uneasily to Krogstad’s presence, and Dr. Rank, coming out of the study, says Krogstad is “morally sick.” Once he has finished meeting with Krogstad, Torvald comes into the living room and says that he can probably hire Mrs. Linde at the bank. Dr. Rank, Torvald, and Mrs. Linde then depart, leaving Nora by herself. Nora’s children return with their nanny, Anne-Marie, and Nora plays with them until she notices Krogstad’s presence in the room. The two converse, and Krogstad is revealed to be the source of Nora’s secret loan.
Krogstad states that Torvald wants to fire him from his position at the bank and alludes to his own poor reputation. He asks Nora to use her influence to ensure that his position remains secure. When she refuses, Krogstad points out that he has in his possession a contract that contains Nora’s forgery of her father’s signature. Krogstad blackmails Nora, threatening to reveal her crime and to bring shame and disgrace on both Nora and her husband if she does not prevent Torvald from firing him. Krogstad leaves, and when Torvald returns, Nora tries to convince him not to fire Krogstad, but Torvald will hear nothing of it. He declares Krogstad an immoral man and states that he feels physically ill in the presence of such people.
Act Two opens on the following day, Christmas. Alone, Nora paces her living room, filled with anxiety. Mrs. Linde arrives and helps sew Nora’s costume for the ball that Nora will be attending at her neighbors’ home the following evening. Nora tells Mrs. Linde that Dr. Rank has a mortal illness that he inherited from his father. Nora’s suspicious behavior leads Mrs. Linde to guess that Dr. Rank is the source of Nora’s loan. Nora denies Mrs. Linde’s charge but refuses to reveal the source of her distress. Torvald arrives, and Nora again begs him to keep Krogstad employed at the bank, but again Torvald refuses. When Nora presses him, he admits that Krogstad’s moral behavior isn’t all that bothers him—he dislikes Krogstad’s overly familiar attitude. Torvald and Nora argue until Torvald sends the maid to deliver Krogstad’s letter of dismissal.
Torvald leaves. Dr. Rank arrives and tells Nora that he knows he is close to death. She attempts to cheer him up and begins to flirt with him. She seems to be preparing to ask him to intervene on her behalf in her struggle with Torvald. Suddenly, Dr. Rank reveals to Nora that he is in love with her. In light of this revelation, Nora refuses to ask Dr. Rank for anything.
Once Dr. Rank leaves, Krogstad arrives and demands an explanation for his dismissal. He wants respectability and has changed the terms of the blackmail: he now insists to Nora not only that he be rehired at the bank but that he be rehired in a higher position. He then puts a letter detailing Nora’s debt and forgery in the Helmers’ letterbox. In a panic, Nora tells Mrs. Linde everything, and Mrs. Linde instructs Nora to delay Torvald from opening the letter as long as possible while she goes to speak with Krogstad. In order to distract Torvald from the letterbox, Nora begins to practice the tarantella she will perform at that evening’s costume party. In her agitated emotional state, she dances wildly and violently, displeasing Torvald. Nora manages to make Torvald promise not to open his mail until after she performs at the party. Mrs. Linde soon returns and says that she has left Krogstad a note but that he will be gone until the following evening.
The next night, as the costume party takes place upstairs, Krogstad meets Mrs. Linde in the Helmers’ living room. Their conversation reveals that the two had once been deeply in love, but Mrs. Linde left Krogstad for a wealthier man who would enable her to support her family. She tells Krogstad that now that she is free of her own familial obligations and wishes to be with Krogstad and care for his children. Krogstad is overjoyed and says he will demand his letter back before Torvald can read it and learn Nora’s secret. Mrs. Linde, however, insists he leave the letter, because she believes both Torvald and Nora will be better off once the truth has been revealed.
Soon after Krogstad’s departure, Nora and Torvald enter, back from the costume ball. After saying goodnight to Mrs. Linde, Torvald tells Nora how desirable she looked as she danced. Dr. Rank, who was also at the party and has come to say goodnight, promptly interrupts Torvald’s advances on Nora. After Dr. Rank leaves, Torvald finds in his letterbox two of Dr. Rank’s visiting cards, each with a black cross above the name. Nora knows Dr. Rank’s cards constitute his announcement that he will soon die, and she informs Torvald of this fact. She then insists that Torvald read Krogstad’s letter.
Torvald reads the letter and is outraged. He calls Nora a hypocrite and a liar and complains that she has ruined his happiness. He declares that she will not be allowed to raise their children. Helene then brings in a letter. Torvald opens it and discovers that Krogstad has returned Nora’s contract (which contains the forged signature). Overjoyed, Torvald attempts to dismiss his past insults, but his harsh words have triggered something in Nora. She declares that despite their eight years of marriage, they do not understand one another. Torvald, Nora asserts, has treated her like a “doll” to be played with and admired. She decides to leave Torvald, declaring that she must “make sense of [her]self and everything around her.” She walks out, slamming the door behind her."
Room,"Lucy Honeychurch, a young upper middle class woman, visits Italy under the charge of her older cousin Charlotte. At their pension, or guesthouse, in Florence, they are given rooms that look into the courtyard rather than out over the river Arno. Mr. Emerson, a fellow guest, generously offers them the rooms belonging to himself and his son George. Although Charlotte is offended by Mr. Emerson's lack of tact and propriety, she finally does agree to the switch. Lucy is an avid young pianist. Mr. Beebe, watches her passionate playing and predicts that someday she will live her life with as much gusto as she plays the piano.
Lucy's visit to Italy is marked by several significant encounters with the Emersons. In Santa Croce church, George complains that his father means well, but always offends everyone. Mr. Emerson tells Lucy that his son needs her in order to overcome his youthful melancholy. Later, Lucy is walking in the Piazza Signoria, feeling dull, when she comes in close contact with two quarreling Italian men. One man stabs the other, and she faints, to be rescued by George. On their return trip home, he kisses her, much to her surprise. She keeps his rash behavior a secret.
On a country outing in the hills, Lucy wanders in search of Mr. Beebe and the supercilious chaplain, Mr. Eager. However, the Italian cab driver leads her instead to George, who is standing on a terrace covered with blue violets. George sees her and again kisses her, but this time Charlotte sees him and chastises him after they have resurnedreturned to the pension. She leaves with Lucy for Rome the next day.
The second half of the book centers on Lucy's home in Surrey, where she lives with her mother, Mrs. Honeychurch, and her brother, Freddy. A man she met in Rome, the snobbish Cecil Vyse, proposes marriage to her for the third time, and she accepts him. He disapproves of her family and the country people she knows, finding them coarse and unsophisticated. There is a small, ugly villa available for rent in the town, and as a joke, Cecil offers it to the Emersons, whom he meets by chance in a museum. They take him up on the offer and move in, much to Lucy's initial horror.
George plays tennis with the Honeychurches on a Sunday when Cecil is at his most intolerable. After the game, Cecil reads from a book by Miss Lavish, a woman who also stayed with Lucy and Charlotte at the pension in Florence. The novel records a kiss among violets, and Lucy realizes that Charlotte let the secret out. In a moment alone, George kisses her again. Lucy tells him to leave, but George insists that Cecil is not the right man for her, characterizing Cecil as controlling and appreciative of things rather than people. Lucy sees Cecil in a new light, and breaks off her engagement that night.
However, Lucy will not believe that she loves George; she wants to stay unmarried and travel to Greece with some elderly women she met in Italy, the Miss Alans. She meets old Mr. Emerson by chance, who insists that she loves George and should marry him, because it is what her soul truly wants. Lucy realizes he is right, and though she must fly against convention, she marries George, and the book ends with the happy couple staying together in the Florence pension again, in a room with a view.
Analysis
The book depicts Lucy's struggles as she emerges as her own woman, growing from indecision to fulfillment. She struggles between strict, old-fashioned Victorian values and newer, more liberal mores. In this struggle Lucy's own idea of what is true evolves and matures. Her trip to Italy opens her sheltered eyes to ideas and people unlike those she has known growing up in the English countryside. She also notices how freely Italian classes seem to mix, and realizes that the social boundaries she has always regarded as fixed are actually arbitrary. Her experience with the Emersons shows her that there can be beauty in the things that are considered improper, and Charlotte's betrayal shows her that propriety is not always the best judge of what is true.
Having more clearly found herself in Italy, Lucy's real test lies at home, where she must confront her old familiar surroundings. She is still uncertain, however, and confused about what to think about her new experiences. That she missteps and becomes engaged to the pretentious and domineering Cecil shows her susceptibility to the pressures of society. As her bold piano playing suggests, she is cut out for a more daring life, if only she could cut herself away from the restricting social boundaries that engulf her. The Emersons, as free-thinking, modern, truth-loving people, are her deliverers from the grips of society. It is this freedom that allows her to see beyond the dictates of propriety that forbid her marriage to the lower-class George and, therefore, to follow her heart.
George is troubled by existential worries in Italy. He doesn't understand how life can be truly joyful and worthwhile when it is always shadowed by enigma, symbolized by the question mark that he hangs on the wall of his hotel. Lucy, though cautious, is loving by nature and enjoys life even when it challenges her understanding. The two are united by a shared appreciation for beauty, which might be captured in their love of views: Lucy adores the view of the Arno through the pension window, while George's first memory is of himself and his parents gazing at a view. Each possesses what the other needs: George finds simple joys staying with the Honeychurch family, while Lucy finds the courage to recognize her own individuality through her contact with the Emersons.

A Room with a View is one of Forster's early works, and is not as complex as the more mature Howard's End and Passage to India. However, its strength lies in its vivid cast of characters, humorous dialogue, and comedic play upon the manners of the day, and in Forster's engaging, sympathetic exploration of Lucy's character."
Successively,"Beloved begins in 1873 in Cincinnati, Ohio, where Sethe, a former slave, has been living with her eighteen-year-old daughter Denver. Sethe’s mother-in-law, Baby Suggs, lived with them until her death eight years earlier. Just before Baby Suggs’s death, Sethe’s two sons, Howard and Buglar, ran away. Sethe believes they fled because of the malevolent presence of an abusive ghost that has haunted their house at 124 Bluestone Road for years. Denver, however, likes the ghost, which everyone believes to be the spirit of her dead sister.
On the day the novel begins, Paul D, whom Sethe has not seen since they worked together on Mr. Garner’s Sweet Home plantation in Kentucky approximately twenty years earlier, stops by Sethe’s house. His presence resurrects memories that have lain buried in Sethe’s mind for almost two decades. From this point on, the story will unfold on two temporal planes. The present in Cincinnati constitutes one plane, while a series of events that took place around twenty years earlier, mostly in Kentucky, constitutes the other. This latter plane is accessed and described through the fragmented flashbacks of the major characters. Accordingly, we frequently read these flashbacks several times, sometimes from varying perspectives, with each successive narration of an event adding a little more information to the previous ones.
From these fragmented memories, the following story begins to emerge: Sethe, the protagonist, was born in the South to an African mother she never knew. When she is thirteen, she is sold to the Garners, who own Sweet Home and practice a comparatively benevolent kind of slavery. There, the other slaves, who are all men, lust after her but never touch her. Their names are Sixo, Paul D, Paul A, Paul F, and Halle. Sethe chooses to marry Halle, apparently in part because he has proven generous enough to buy his mother’s freedom by hiring himself out on the weekends. Together, Sethe and Halle have two sons, Howard and Buglar, as well as a baby daughter whose name we never learn. When she leaves Sweet Home, Sethe is also pregnant with a fourth child. After the eventual death of the proprietor, Mr. Garner, the widowed Mrs. Garner asks her sadistic, vehemently racist brother-in-law to help her run the farm. He is known to the slaves as schoolteacher, and his oppressive presence makes life on the plantation even more unbearable than it had been before. The slaves decide to run.
Schoolteacher and his nephews anticipate the slaves’ escape, however, and capture Paul D and Sixo. Schoolteacher kills Sixo and brings Paul D back to Sweet Home, where Paul D sees Sethe for what he believes will be the last time. She is still intent on running, having already sent her children ahead to her mother-in-law Baby Suggs’s house in Cincinnati. Invigorated by the recent capture, schoolteacher’s nephews seize Sethe in the barn and violate her, stealing the milk her body is storing for her infant daughter. Unbeknownst to Sethe, Halle is watching the event from a loft above her, where he lies frozen with horror. Afterward, Halle goes mad: Paul D sees him sitting by a churn with butter slathered all over his face. Paul D, meanwhile, is forced to suffer the indignity of wearing an iron bit in his mouth.
When schoolteacher finds out that Sethe has reported his and his nephews’ misdeeds to Mrs. Garner, he has her whipped severely, despite the fact that she is pregnant. Swollen and scarred, Sethe nevertheless runs away, but along the way she collapses from exhaustion in a forest. A white girl, Amy Denver, finds her and nurses her back to health. When Amy later helps Sethe deliver her baby in a boat, Sethe names this second daughter Denver after the girl who helped her. Sethe receives further help from Stamp Paid, who rows her across the Ohio River to Baby Suggs’s house. Baby Suggs cleans Sethe up before allowing her to see her three older children.
Sethe spends twenty-eight wonderful days in Cincinnati, where Baby Suggs serves as an unofficial preacher to the black community. On the last day, however, schoolteacher comes for Sethe to take her and her children back to Sweet Home. Rather than surrender her children to a life of dehumanizing slavery, she flees with them to the woodshed and tries to kill them. Only the third child, her older daughter, dies, her throat having been cut with a handsaw by Sethe. Sethe later arranges for the baby’s headstone to be carved with the word “Beloved.” The sheriff takes Sethe and Denver to jail, but a group of white abolitionists, led by the Bodwins, fights for her release. Sethe returns to the house at 124, where Baby Suggs has sunk into a deep depression. The community shuns the house, and the family continues to live in isolation.
Meanwhile, Paul D has endured torturous experiences in a chain gang in Georgia, where he was sent after trying to kill Brandywine, a slave owner to whom he was sold by schoolteacher. His traumatic experiences have caused him to lock away his memories, emotions, and ability to love in the “tin tobacco box” of his heart. One day, a fortuitous rainstorm allows Paul D and the other chain gang members to escape. He travels northward by following the blossoming spring flowers. Years later, he ends up on Sethe’s porch in Cincinnati.
Paul D’s arrival at 124 commences the series of events taking place in the present time frame. Prior to moving in, Paul D chases the house’s resident ghost away, which makes the already lonely Denver resent him from the start. Sethe and Paul D look forward to a promising future together, until one day, on their way home from a carnival, they encounter a strange young woman sleeping near the steps of 124. Most of the characters believe that the woman—who calls herself Beloved—is the embodied spirit of Sethe’s dead daughter, and the novel provides a wealth of evidence supporting this interpretation. Denver develops an obsessive attachment to Beloved, and Beloved’s attachment to Sethe is equally if not more intense. Paul D and Beloved hate each other, and Beloved controls Paul D by moving him around the house like a rag doll and by seducing him against his will.
When Paul D learns the story of Sethe’s “rough choice”—her infanticide—he leaves 124 and begins sleeping in the basement of the local church. In his absence, Sethe and Beloved’s relationship becomes more intense and exclusive. Beloved grows increasingly abusive, manipulative, and parasitic, and Sethe is obsessed with satisfying Beloved’s demands and making her understand why she murdered her. Worried by the way her mother is wasting away, Denver leaves the premises of 124 for the first time in twelve years in order to seek help from Lady Jones, her former teacher. The community provides the family with food and eventually organizes under the leadership of Ella, a woman who had worked on the Underground Railroad and helped with Sethe’s escape, in order to exorcise Beloved from 124. When they arrive at Sethe’s house, they see Sethe on the porch with Beloved, who stands smiling at them, naked and pregnant. Mr. Bodwin, who has come to 124 to take Denver to her new job, arrives at the house. Mistaking him for schoolteacher, Sethe runs at Mr. Bodwin with an ice pick. She is restrained, but in the confusion Beloved disappears, never to return.
Afterward, Paul D comes back to Sethe, who has retreated to Baby Suggs’s bed to die. Mourning Beloved, Sethe laments, “She was my best thing.” But Paul D replies, “You your best thing, Sethe.” The novel then ends with a warning that “[t]his is not a story to pass on.” The town, and even the residents of 124, have forgotten Beloved “[l]ike an unpleasant dream during a troubling sleep.”"
Shock,"Janie Crawford, an attractive, confident, middle-aged Black woman, returns to Eatonville, Florida, after a long absence. The Black townspeople gossip about her and speculate about where she has been and what has happened to her young husband, Tea Cake. They take her confidence as aloofness, but Janie’s friend Pheoby Watson sticks up for her. Pheoby visits her to find out what has happened. Their conversation frames the story that Janie relates.
Janie explains that her grandmother raised her after her mother ran off. Nanny loves her granddaughter and is dedicated to her, but her life as a slave and experience with her own daughter, Janie’s mother, has warped her worldview. Her primary desire is to marry Janie as soon as possible to a husband who can provide security and social status for her. She finds a much older farmer named Logan Killicks and insists that Janie marry him.
After moving in with Logan, Janie is miserable. Logan is pragmatic and unromantic and, in general, treats her like a pack mule. One day, Joe Starks, a smooth-tongued and ambitious man, ambles down the road in front of the farm. He and Janie flirt in secret for a couple weeks before she runs off and marries him.
Janie and Jody, as she calls him, travel to all-Black Eatonville, where Jody hopes to have a “big voice.” A consummate politician, Jody soon succeeds in becoming the mayor, postmaster, storekeeper, and the biggest landlord in town. But Janie seeks something more than a man with a big voice. She soon becomes disenchanted with the monotonous, stifling life that she shares with Jody. She wishes that she could be a part of the rich social life in town, but Jody doesn’t allow her to interact with “common” people. Jody sees Janie as the fitting ornament to his wealth and power, and he tries to shape her into his vision of what a mayor’s wife should be. On the surface, Janie silently submits to Jody; inside, however, she remains passionate and full of dreams.
After almost two decades of marriage, Janie finally asserts herself. When Jody insults her appearance, Janie rips him to shreds in front of the townspeople, telling them all how ugly and impotent he is. In retaliation, he savagely beats her. Their marriage breaks down, and Jody becomes quite ill. After months without interacting, Janie visits him on his deathbed. Refusing to be silenced, she once again chastises him for the way that he treated her. As she berates him, he dies.
After Jody’s funeral, Janie feels free for the first time in years. She rebuffs various suitors who come to court her because she loves her newfound independence. But when Tea Cake, a man twelve years her junior, enters her life, Janie immediately senses a spark of mutual attraction. She begins dating Tea Cake despite critical gossip within the town. To everyone’s shock, Janie then marries Tea Cake nine months after Jody’s death, sells Jody’s store, and leaves town to go with Tea Cake to Jacksonville.
During the first week of their marriage, Tea Cake and Janie encounter difficulties. He steals her money and leaves her alone one night, making her think that he married her only for her money. But he returns, explaining that he never meant to leave her and that his theft occurred in a moment of weakness. Afterward, they promise to share all their experiences and opinions with each other. They move to the Everglades, where they work during the harvest season and socialize during the summer off-season. Tea Cake’s quick wit and friendliness make their shack the center of entertainment and social life.
A terrible hurricane bursts into the Everglades two years after Janie and Tea Cake’s marriage. As they desperately flee the rising waters, a rabid dog bites Tea Cake. At the time, Tea Cake doesn’t realize the dog’s condition; three weeks later, however, he falls ill. During a rabies--induced bout of madness, Tea Cake becomes convinced that Janie is cheating on him. He starts firing a pistol at her and Janie is forced to kill him to save her life. She is immediately put on trial for murder, but the all-white, all-male jury finds her not guilty. She returns to Eatonville where her former neighbors are ready to spin malicious gossip about her circumstances, assuming that Tea Cake has left her and taken her money. Janie wraps up her recounting to Pheoby, who is greatly impressed by Janie’s experiences. Back in her room that night, Janie feels at one with Tea Cake and at peace with herself."
Becoming,"Michelle Obama grows up in a two-story bungalow on Chicago’s South Side. Her parents, Fraser and Marian Robinson, rent an upstairs apartment from Marian’s aunt and uncle, who live downstairs. Michelle’s father has multiple sclerosis, but he does not let his disability limit him. He works at a water filtration plant and is also a local precinct captain for the Democratic party. Michelle is a smart, determined girl with little tolerance for disorder. She is less sociable than her older brother, Craig, a gifted basketball player who has many friends. Over time, however, Michelle learns to be more outgoing.
Michelle’s parents believe in education. Her mother does volunteer work on behalf of their neighborhood school, which struggles to maintain quality as the neighborhood declines. Fraser and Marian send Craig to a predominantly white Catholic school with a strong basketball program and a rigorous curriculum. When Michelle is ready for high school, she gains admission to Whitney Young, a new magnet school for gifted students. At Whitney Young, her friendship with a daughter of civil rights leader the Reverend Jesse Jackson gives Michelle a chance to observe what life is like for people active in politics.
Michelle follows her brother to Princeton, where she does well. One of her closest friends at Princeton is a Jamaican student named Suzanne; that friendship helps Michelle see that not everyone has to be as organized and driven as she is. Michelle graduates, studies law at Harvard, and goes to work at a high-end law firm in Chicago. By then, however, she realizes that she hates being a lawyer. Her life takes a turn when she is asked to help mentor a male summer associate named Barack Obama. The son of a Black Kenyan father and a white American mother, he is older than Michelle but started law school later, after some years doing other things, including community organizing in Chicago. Barack’s brilliance is quickly apparent to everyone at the firm, and he and Michelle are immediately attracted to each other.
As Michelle and Barack get acquainted, she sees that he has a higher tolerance for turmoil and uncertainty than she does. She also sees his dedication to making the world a better place. However, Michelle faces crushing loss: her friend Suzanne dies of cancer, and her father dies from MS after decades of fighting to live a normal life. Realizing that life is short, Michelle looks for opportunities to transition out of her legal career. Some personal connections lead to a job at city hall, working for Valerie Jarrett, who will become a lifelong friend and ally. Barack, meanwhile, works in the Chicago area for a national get-out-the vote organization. By now, he and Michelle are engaged. They marry in 1992.
Barack is working for a public interest law firm when the opportunity arises for him to run for a seat in the Illinois state senate. By now, Michelle has run a nonprofit organization and is serving as a university dean. Michelle does not like politics and predicts that Barack will not like it, either; but after he wins his race, he turns out to have the right kind of temperament and skills to be a politician. Then Barack loses his mother to cancer, and Michelle suffers a miscarriage. After failed attempts to conceive again, the Obamas turn to in vitro fertilization (IVF) and their first daughter, Malia, is born Michelle becomes director of community outreach at a hospital. 
After a failed campaign for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, daughter Sasha is born. Their burgeoning family and careers but strains on Michelle and Barack, but couples therapy helps them make some useful adjustments. Barack runs for the U.S. Senate and unexpectedly builds a commanding lead even before his speech at the Democratic National Convention boosts his national profile. He wins the Senate race easily.
When Barack moves to Washington, Michelle and the girls stay in Chicago. To her consternation, Barack and a team of advisers are already discussing a 2008 presidential run. She agrees to be part of the campaign but privately thinks that as a Black man, Barack cannot win. During the campaign, there are absurd rumors, circulated by his opponents, about Barack having Muslim ties. Michelle is an asset on the campaign trail, although she is discouraged when a video of one of her speeches is edited down to suggests that she carries a grudge against America. After the August convention, where Michelle gives a well-received speech, Barack and his running mate, Joe Biden, achieve a decisive win. Michelle believes that Barack is the right person to lead the country out of the ongoing economic recession.
The transition between the Bush and Obama administrations is smooth and welcoming. The White House staff is kind and efficient. Michelle and Barack learn to get used to being accompanied by Secret Service agents whenever they go out, but they do their best to keep the girls’ lives as normal as possible. Michelle’s mother, whom Barack and Michelle persuaded to move in with them, declines Secret Service protection altogether.
As First Lady, Michelle must be engaged and productive without overstepping her bounds. Her early work focuses on childhood obesity, through the Let’s Move! initiative to promote exercise and healthy eating. Michelle plants a vegetable garden on the South Lawn. She also promotes post-high school education through her Reach Higher initiative, and education for girls around the world through the Let Girls Learn initiative. Finally, she teams up with the Second Lady, Jill Biden, to improve support for military families through the Joining Forces initiative. 
During Barack’s successful reelection campaign in 2012, Michelle discovers the power of social media. Like the rest of the country, the Obamas are shocked by mass shootings at Sandy Hook School in Newtown, Connecticut and at a Black church in Charleston. The death of a Chicago girl in a drive-by shooting has personal meaning for Michelle: the girl lived not far from Michelle’s old neighborhood and had recently participated in the second inaugural celebration. 
During the 2016 presidential contest, Michelle is appalled by Donald Trump’s past and present behavior and is shocked when he achieves a come-from-behind win over Hillary Clinton. She takes comfort in all the things she and Barack have accomplished over the last eight years and reminds herself that there is much to be optimistic about."
Moscow,"A Gentleman in Moscow opens in June of 1922 as a committee of Russia’s Bolshevik government sentences Count Alexander Rostov to lifelong house arrest in the Hotel Metropol in central Moscow. As an aristocrat, Rostov might have been sentenced to death, but the committee takes into account the pro-revolutionary sentiments contained in a poem he published nine years earlier called ""Where Is It Now,"" when the Tsar still ruled. The Count is moved into tiny quarters, on a floor once reserved for servants, but after that he is left largely alone. For the next thirty-two years, the luxury of the Metropol will remain largely preserved, as a place for the new regime’s elite to enjoy the privileges once reserved for the old elite, and also as a place where foreign journalists and dignitaries can be entertained and simultaneously spied on. 
Initially, the Count covers his living expenses using a stash of gold coins hidden in a large desk he kept with him. Within a few days of the start of his house arrest, he makes the acquaintance of Nina, a nine-year old girl with a great deal of curiosity. Nina, the daughter of a Ukrainian bureaucrat staying at the hotel, has somehow obtained a passkey that provides access to all the Metropol’s rooms and hidden spaces. Nina leads the Count on explorations of the basement, and on spying expeditions to eavesdrop on political meetings in the ballroom. It troubles the Count that whereas Nina was once interested in princesses, she is increasingly caught up in the enthusiasms of the bureaucrats and union bosses they listen in on. The hotel’s seamstress, Marina, is the Count’s sounding board and guide as he tries to understand what makes little girls tick. Unhappily, there comes a day in December when Nina has to tell the Count that she will be starting school and can no longer spend every day with him. As a farewell gift, she gives him her passkey.
The next summer, another female presence comes into the Count’s life: Anna Urbanova, a famous actress. Their first interaction is frosty, but they soon become intimate and settle into a comfortable pattern of sleeping together whenever she stays at the Metropol. Meanwhile, as the new Soviet Union is formally recognized by Western nations, the hotel starts to recover from the business slump that followed the Revolution. However, an incompetent waiter with whom the Count has a brief, seemingly inconsequential encounter, turns out to have friends in high places. This waiter, whom the Count calls the Bishop, begins to rise in rank and influence at the Metropol. One day, a complaint the Bishop lodges with a government official leads to an edict that all bottles in the wine cellar, regardless of vintage, must be sold unlabeled, at a single price. The Count, who has been following political events with concern, concludes that the way of life he knows and loves is being swept away for good. On the tenth anniversary of his beloved sister’s death, he prepares to jump off the hotel roof. Only a handyman’s coincidental, timely interruption stops him.
The day after his failed suicide attempt, the Count asks the Metropol’s maître d’ for a job as a waiter. Knowledgeable about food, and skilled in dealing with people, the Count becomes the headwaiter within four years. He, the maître d’, and the hotel chef form a Triumvirate of friends who run the Metropol’s dinner services, including the Boyarsky restaurant and special events in private rooms. The Bishop is a continual thorn in the Triumvirate’s side.
In 1930, the Count runs into Nina as she and three other members of the Young Communist League are about to travel east to help collectivize farms. One of the other members is a boy she later marries. When he is arrested in 1938 and sent to Siberia, Nina prepares to follow. She asks the Count to look after her young daughter, Sofia, for a month or two, while Nina goes to Siberia to find work and a place to live. The Count never sees Nina again. For the next sixteen years, he raises Sofia as his daughter, always with Marina advising him as a mentor and friend. The Count, for his part, becomes the informal tutor of a government official named Osip Glebnikov, who wants to learn—discreetly—about the values and culture of the West. Eventually, the Count and Osip move from books to films, and soon after are trading opinions about Humphrey Bogart movies.
By 1950, Sofia is seventeen years old and has started taking piano lessons from Viktor Skadovsky, who conducts the orchestra that plays in hotel’s lobby-floor restaurant, the Piazza. Within three years, she is studying music at the Moscow Conservatory. When she wins a competition, the Count and her hotel friends celebrate with her. As the celebration winds down, however, a visitor, Katerina Litvinova, brings the Count sad news. Katerina is the longtime lover of the Count’s friend from university days, “Mishka” Mindich. Mishka was bookish and hot-tempered, but somehow he and the Count became the best of friends. Over the years, Mishka would drop on in the Count and share the latest developments in the new, proletariat-oriented poetry movement he and others were leading. Mishka was sent to Siberia after he denounced a decision his superior made about a project Mishka had been working on. Mishka was able to visit the Count once after completing his eight-year sentence, but now he is dead. When Katerina mentions the Count’s own poetry, the Count gently corrects her: all the poems published under the Count’s name were really Mishka’s.
When Sofia is invited to participate in a Conservatory goodwill tour that will include a performance in Paris, the Count arranges, with the help of a friend at the American embassy in Paris, for Sofia to defect to the West. The Bishop, by now the manager of the entire hotel, surprises the Count at a critical moment, but the Count is able to turn the tables. He marches the Bishop down to the basement at gunpoint and locks him in a room where he will not be found for a few days. After the Count receives confirmation that Sofia has arrived safely at the embassy, he makes his own escape from the Metropol with the help of Viktor Skadovsky. The responsibility for investigating the Count’s escape lies with Osip, who chooses to let the matter drop. After days of walking, the Count returns to the site where his family estate once stood. In a tavern in a village a few miles away, he meets up with Anna Urbanova."
Behalf,"Lawyer Bryan Stevenson gives a first-person account of his decades helping marginalized Americans who have been unfairly and harshly punished by the U.S. criminal justice system, which disproportionately targets people of color and poor people. At the heart of Just Mercy is the story of Walter McMillian, a Black man who was framed for the murder of a girl named Ronda Morrison, convicted, and sent to death row. 
Stevenson alternates chapters about Walter with his personal reflections on our country’s history with racial disparity and issues around incarceration. Stevenson highlights other groups of vulnerable people who have been victimized by the criminal justice system and shares the stories of the prisoners he has helped over the years. The book also follows the growth of Stevenson’s nonprofit law project, the Alabama-based Equal Justice Initiative (EJI), through its expansion from focusing on death row prisoners to helping people sentenced to life without parole. Stevenson chronicles how EJI becomes a significant force in criminal justice reform.
In 1983 as a law student, Stevenson discovers his life’s passion when he interns with the Georgia-based Southern Prisoners Defense Committee and meets his first death row prisoner. After graduation Stevenson accepts a job with the organization to represent poor prisoners, including those in Alabama who lack any public defender. He meets Walter McMillian on Alabama’s death row. Walter owns a successful business but also transgresses racial boundaries when he has an affair with a white woman. Soon after the affair becomes public, the woman’s friend, Ralph Myers, accuses Walter of committing the unsolved murder of Ronda Morrison, which has outraged the community. Law enforcement, including a racist sheriff and the district attorney, eagerly pounces on this accusation, overlooking Walter’s alibi and a lack of evidence. Instead, they actively force Ralph to stick with his story even when he tries to recant. They coerce other false witness testimonies, and—as revealed years later—actively suppress evidence.
After Stevenson and the team at EJI unsuccessfully appeal Walter’s conviction, they launch their own investigation of the crime and uncover new evidence. They find witnesses who can prove the witnesses against Walter lied as well as financial records that indicate that one of these witnesses was paid to give false testimony. Stevenson and his team also petition for and receive all records from Walter’s trial. However, their big break comes when they receive a phone call from Ralph, who now wants to make amends. Ralph admits to lying about Walter and says he was threatened by law enforcement. Stevenson wins a hearing for Walter where he can present his new evidence: Ralph’s testimony, which is confirmed by health care workers and other inmates, as well as recordings of the law enforcement team threatening Ralph if he doesn’t frame Walter. 
While the judge refuses to grant Walter relief, Stevenson continues the appeal process through the Alabama courts. The district attorney asks outside agents to investigate the murder for which Walter was convicted, and the investigators determine that Walter had nothing to do with the crime. Six weeks later, the court invalidates Walter’s conviction. Stevenson and the State file a joint motion to dismiss the charges, and Walter is set free.
Throughout the process, Stevenson and Walter become close friends, and Stevenson helps Walter upon his release, including filing a civil suit on his behalf and offering him a place to stay. Walter works with Stevenson to share his story, giving interviews and speaking at legal conferences, and Walter is even featured in a documentary. Unfortunately, Walter is diagnosed with advancing dementia and is forced to rely on family and eventually a nursing facility for his care. He dies in 2013. Stevenson gives a eulogy at his funeral and shares all he learned from Walter, particularly that we must extend mercy to everyone, even those who have not earned it.
Interspersed with chapters chronicling Walter’s narrative are stories of Stevenson’s other clients and work. His closeness with these prisoners and their horrifying circumstances makes Stevenson more determined to help and causes him to reflect on abstract issues that nevertheless imbue the criminal justice system, like humanity and mercy. Stevenson focuses on several categories of vulnerable people who become trapped in the system, including mentally ill prisoners, disabled prisoners, and poor women who give birth to stillborn babies. 
Stevenson and his team at EJI also become increasingly focused on juvenile offenders who are sometimes tried as adults despite their young age. These offenders may be given de facto death sentences by being sentenced to life without parole and face perilous circumstances when they are housed in adult prisons. Stevenson illustrates how these prisoners retain their own humanity while being forced to live under inhumane conditions. He also discusses some of the qualities common among these types of prisoners: They are generally poor and disproportionately people of color, and most of them lack adequate legal counsel. The juveniles have horrific backgrounds of abuse and neglect.
Stevenson and his team at EJI also work to change the legal system to offer more protection to marginalized people. Several of his cases end up before the U.S. Supreme Court, and he succeeds in winning rulings that ban as unconstitutional the conviction of children to life without parole and the execution of people deemed incompetent from dementia or neurological disease. EJI works to raise public awareness of issues surrounding unfair incarceration, produces groundbreaking reports on racial issues, and sets up programs to help formerly incarcerated people adjust to life on the outside.
Stevenson also reflects on the issues that surround the criminal justice system. His time spent with prisoners awaiting their execution makes him realize how inhumane it is to prepare another human to die. After decades of work, when Stevenson fails to prevent the execution of a man who suffers from an intellectual disability, he momentarily feels unable to continue his work. However, he realizes that he cannot help but be broken by his experiences and comes to understand that it is his own brokenness that allows him to more fully understand the need for mercy and to bring compassion to others. The book ends with Stevenson’s renewed commitment to helping others."
Turns,"An anonymous narrator recalls a Christmas Eve gathering at an old house, where guests listen to one another’s ghost stories. A guest named Douglas introduces a story that involves two children—Flora and Miles—and his sister’s governess, with whom he was in love. After procuring the governess’s written record of events from his home, he provides a few introductory details. A handsome bachelor persuaded the governess to take a position as governess for his niece and nephew in an isolated country home after the previous governess died. Douglas begins to read from the written record, and the story shifts to the governess’s point of view as she narrates her strange experience. 
The governess begins her story with her first day at Bly, the country home, where she meets Flora and a maid named Mrs. Grose. The governess is nervous but feels relieved by Flora’s beauty and charm. The next day she receives a letter from her employer, which contains a letter from Miles’s headmaster saying that Miles cannot return to school. The letter does not specify what Miles has done to deserve expulsion, and, alarmed, the governess questions Mrs. Grose about it. Mrs. Grose admits that Miles has on occasion been bad, but only in the ways boys ought to be. The governess is reassured as she drives to meet Miles. 
One evening, as the governess strolls around the grounds, she sees a strange man in a tower of the house and exchanges an intense stare with him. She says nothing to Mrs. Grose. Later, she catches the same man glaring into the dining-room window, and she rushes outside to investigate. The man is gone, and the governess looks into the window from outside. Her image in the window frightens Mrs. Grose, who has just walked into the room. The governess discusses her two experiences with Mrs. Grose, who identifies the strange man as Peter Quint, a former valet who is now dead. 
Convinced that the ghost seeks Miles, the governess becomes rigid in her supervision of the children. One day, when the governess is at the lake with Flora, she sees a woman dressed in black and senses that the woman is Miss Jessel, her dead predecessor. The governess is certain Flora was aware of the ghost’s presence but intentionally kept quiet. The governess again questions Mrs. Grose about Miles’s misbehavior. Mrs. Grose reveals that Quint had been “too free” with Miles, and Miss Jessel with Flora. The governess is on her guard, but the days pass without incident, and Miles and Flora express increased affection for the governess. 
The lull is broken one evening when something startles the governess from her reading. She rises to investigate, moving to the landing above the staircase. There, a gust of wind extinguishes her candle, and she sees Quint halfway up the stairs. She refuses to back down, exchanging another intense stare with Quint until he vanishes. Back in her room, the governess finds Flora’s bed curtains pulled forward, but Flora herself is missing. Noticing movement under the window blind, the governess watches as Flora emerges from behind it. The governess questions Flora about what she’s been doing, but Flora’s explanation is unrevealing.
The governess does not sleep well during the next few nights. One night, she sees the ghost of Miss Jessel sitting on the bottom stair, her head in her hands. Later, when the governess finally allows herself to go to sleep at her regular hour, she is awoken after midnight to find her candle extinguished and Flora by the window. Careful not to disturb Flora, the governess leaves the room to find a window downstairs that overlooks the same view. Looking out, she sees the faraway figure of Miles on the lawn. 
Later, the governess discusses with Mrs. Grose her conversation with Miles, who claimed that he wanted to show the governess that he could be “bad.” The governess concludes that Flora and Miles frequently meet with Miss Jessel and Quint. At this, Mrs. Grose urges the governess to appeal to her employer, but the governess refuses, reminding her colleague that the children’s uncle does not want to be bothered. She threatens to leave if Mrs. Grose writes to him. On the walk to church one Sunday, Miles broaches the topic of school to the governess. He says he wants to go back and declares he will make his uncle come to Bly. The governess, shaken, does not go into church. Instead, she returns to the house and plots her departure. She sits on the bottom stair but springs up when she remembers seeing Miss Jessel there. She enters the schoolroom and finds Miss Jessel sitting at the table. She screams at the ghost, and the ghost vanishes. The governess decides she will stay at Bly. Mrs. Grose and the children return, saying nothing about the governess’s absence at church. The governess agrees to write to her employer.
That evening, the governess listens outside Miles’s door. He invites her in, and she questions him. She embraces him impulsively. The candle goes out, and Miles shrieks. The next day Miles plays the piano for the governess. She suddenly realizes she doesn’t know where Flora is. She and Mrs. Grose find Flora by the lake. There, the governess sees an apparition of Miss Jessel. She points it out to Flora and Mrs. Grose, but both claim not to see it. Flora says that the governess is cruel and that she wants to get away from her, and the governess collapses on the ground in hysterics. The next day, Mrs. Grose informs the governess that Flora is sick. They decide Mrs. Grose will take Flora to the children’s uncle while the governess stays at Bly with Miles. Mrs. Grose informs the governess that Luke didn’t send the letter she wrote to her employer, because he couldn’t find it. 
With Flora and Mrs. Grose gone, Miles and the governess talk after dinner. The governess asks if he took her letter. He confesses, and the governess sees Quint outside. She watches Quint in horror, then points him out to Miles, who asks if it is Peter Quint and looks out the window in vain. He cries out, then falls into the governess’s arms, dead."
Can,"Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy Pevensie are four siblings sent to live in the country with the eccentric Professor Kirke during World War II. The children explore the house on a rainy day and Lucy, the youngest, finds an enormous wardrobe. Lucy steps inside and finds herself in a strange, snowy wood. Lucy encounters the Faun Tumnus, who is surprised to meet a human girl. Tumnus tells Lucy that she has entered Narnia, a different world. Tumnus invites Lucy to tea, and she accepts. Lucy and Tumnus have a wonderful tea, but the faun bursts into tears and confesses that he is a servant of the evil White Witch. The Witch has enchanted Narnia so that it is always winter and never Christmas. Tumnus explains that he has been enlisted to capture human beings. Lucy implores Tumnus to release her, and he agrees.
Lucy exits Narnia and eagerly tells her siblings about her adventure in the wardrobe. They do not believe her, however. Lucy's siblings insist that Lucy was only gone for seconds and not for hours as she claims. When the Pevensie children look in the back of the wardrobe they see that it is an ordinary piece of furniture. Edmund teases Lucy mercilessly about her imaginary country until one day when he sees her vanishing into the wardrobe. Edmund follows Lucy and finds himself in Narnia as well. He does not see Lucy, and instead meets the White Witch that Tumnus told Lucy about. The Witch Witch introduces herself to Edmund as the Queen of Narnia. The Witch feeds Edmund enchanted Turkish Delight, which gives Edmund an insatiable desire for the dessert. The Witch uses Edmund's greed and gluttony to convince Edmund to bring back his siblings to meet her.
On the way back to the lamppost, the border between Narnia and our world, Edmund meets Lucy. Lucy tells Edmund about the White Witch. Edmund denies any connection between the Witch and the Queen. All Edmund can think about is his desire for the Turkish Delight. Lucy and Edmund return to Peter and Susan, back in their own world. Lucy relies on Edmund to support her story about Narnia, but Edmund spitefully tells Peter and Susan that it is a silly story. Peter and Susan are worried that Lucy is insane so they talk to Professor Kirke. The Professor shocks Peter and Susan by arguing that Lucy is telling the truth.
One day the children hide in the wardrobe to avoid the housekeeper and some houseguests. Suddenly all four Pevensie children find themselves in Narnia. Lucy leads them to Tumnus's home, but a note informs them that Tumnus has been arrested on charges of treason. Lucy realized that this means the Witch knows that Tumnus spared Lucy's life, and that the Witch has captured Tumnus. Lucy implores her siblings to help her rescue Tumnus from the Witch. Guided by a friendly robin, the children wander into the woods, and meet Mr. Beaver. Mr. Beaver brings them back to his home, where he explains that the children cannot do anything to save Tumnus. The only thing the children can do is join Mr. Beaver on a journey to see Aslan a lion. Aslan appears to be a king or god figure in Narnia. The children are all pleasantly enchanted by the name Aslan, except for Edmund, who is horrified by the sound of it. Mr. Beaver, Peter, Susan, and Lucy plot to meet Aslan at the Stone Table the following day, but they soon notice that Edmund has disappeared. Meanwhile, Edmund searches for the White Witch to warn her of Aslan's arrival and of the Beavers' plan. The Witch is enraged to hear that Aslan is in Narnia and immediately begins plotting to kill the children. The Witch wants to avoid an ancient prophecy that says that four humans will someday reign over Narnia and overthrow her evil regime.
The children and the Beavers, meanwhile, rush to reach the Stone Table before the Witch. As they travel, wonderful seasonal changes occur. First they meet Santa Claus, or Father Christmas, who explains that the Witch's spell of ""always winter and never Christmas"" has ended. The enchanted winter snow melts and the children see signs of spring. Simultaneously, the Witch drags Edmund toward the Stone Table and treats him very poorly. Once spring arrives, the Witch cannot use her sledge anymore, so she cannot reach the Stone Table before the children.
When the other three Pevensies meet Aslan, they are awed by him, but they quickly grow more comfortable in his presence. They love him immediately, despite their fear. Aslan promises to do all that he can to save Edmund. He takes Peter aside to show him the castle where he will be king. As they are talking, they hear Susan blowing the magic horn that Father Christmas gave her to her, signaling that she is in danger. Aslan sends Peter to help her. Arriving on the scene, Peter sees a wolf attacking Susan, and stabs it to death with the sword given him by Father Christmas. Aslan sees another wolf vanishing into a thicket, and sends his followers to trail it, hoping it will lead them to the Witch.
The Witch is preparing to kill Edmund as the rescue party arrives. Aslan and his followers rescue Edmund, but are unable to find the Witch, who disguises herself as part of the landscape. Edmund is happy to see his siblings, as he has accepted that the Witch is evil. The next day, the Witch and Aslan speak and the Witch demands Edmund's life because she says that Edmund is a traitor. The Witch says that according to the Deep Magic of Narnia, a traitor life's is forfeit to the Witch. Aslan does not deny this, and he secretly reaches a compromise with her. The Witch appears very pleased, while Aslan seems pensive and depressed.
The following night, Susan and Lucy observe Aslan grow increasingly gloomy and sad. The sisters are unable to sleep, and they notice that Aslan has disappeared. Susan and Lucy leave the pavilion to search for Aslan. When they find Aslan, he tells them they can stay until he tells them they must leave. Together, Aslan, Susan, and Lucy walk to the Stone Table, where Aslan tells them to leave. Susan and Lucy hide behind some bushes and watch the Witch and a horde of her followers torment, humiliate, and finally kill Aslan. The Witch explains that Aslan sacrificed his life for Edmund.
Susan and Lucy stay with Aslan's dead body all night. In the morning, they hear a great cracking noise, and are astounded to see the Stone Table broken. Aslan has disappeared. Suddenly Susan and Lucy hear Aslan's voice from behind him. Aslan has risen from the dead. Aslan carries the girls to the Witch's castle, where they free all the prisoners who have been turned to stone. Aslan, Susan, and Lucy charge join the battle between Peter's army and the Witch's troops. Peter and his troops are exhausted. Fortunately, Aslan swiftly kills the Witch and Peter's army then defeats the Witch's followers.
Aslan knights Edmund, who has atoned for his sin of siding with the Witch. The children ascend to the thrones at Cair Paravel, the castle in Narnia. Aslan subsequently disappears. The children eventually become adults and reign over Narnia for many years. One day, in a hunt for a magical white stag, they arrive at the lamppost that had marked the border between Narnia and our world. The Pevensies tumble back out of the wardrobe to our world. No time has passed, and they return to Professor Kirke's house as children. The foursome tells Professor Kirke about their adventure, and the Professor assures them that they will return to Narnia again some day."
Spectacle,"The Underground Railroad tells the story of Cora, a teenager who runs away from the Georgia plantation where she and her family have been slaves for three generations. Cora’s grandmother Ajarry was brought to the United States from Africa on a slave ship and died after decades working in the fields of the Randall plantation. Cora’s mother, Mabel, ran away, abandoning Cora, and everywhere she goes, Cora looks for answers about her mother’s fate. Left without her mother to protect her, Cora is mistreated by the other slaves, although she shows her fierce nature, challenging a slave named Blake who tries to take her garden plot, and protecting a young slave from the cruel master Terrance. Finally, she escapes with another slave, Caesar. They make it to a stop on the underground railroad, but not before some locals try to capture them and Cora kills a teenage white boy in order to get away. 
The underground railroad, in this novel, is an actual railroad with stations below farms and houses. The first train takes Cora and Caesar to South Carolina, where they are able to live more like free people. The move from Georgia to South Carolina sets the pattern of telling a series of stories about Black experience not just during slavery but throughout American history. 
In South Carolina, Cora and Caesar are met by Sam, a cheerful white station agent who will be their contact during their stay and assigns them new identities. Here, Cora and Caesar are housed, fed, and given jobs. Life is so much better than on the plantation, they are able to ignore things that don’t seem fair. After working as a maid, Cora is sent to work as a “type” in a museum that puts forward a very false, positive version of African and slave life. One night, Cora and Caesar learn from Sam that the hospital they thought was helping them with free medical care is actually conducting government experiments to kill off and sterilize Black people. Then they learn that the slave catcher, Ridgeway, has arrived in search of them. Cora escapes to the underground railroad platform, but Caesar is left behind, and Sam’s house is burned to the ground.
Cora’s next stop is North Carolina, where the situation for Black people, free or fugitive, is much worse. Cora is taken to the home of the reluctant station agent Martin Wells and his wife Edith, who is very upset by Cora’s presence. Cora lives in a small hiding space in the Wells’ attic, where she sees a horrible spectacle take place every Friday night on the town square. North Carolina has worked to expel or kill all Black people in the state, and Friday Festivals are a weekly display of racist propaganda ending with the hanging of a Black person, a grisly act in which the whole town participates. As time goes by, Cora improves her reading in the attic room, but there is no way out for her. Finally, Cora falls ill and has to be cared for in the Wells’ home. Their maid Fiona informs on them, and that Friday night a group of night riders searches the house, finding Cora. With the patrollers is the slave catcher, Ridgeway, who chains Cora to his wagon and takes her with him, while Edith and Martin Wells are hanged from the oak tree.
Tennessee is even worse than North Carolina. Cora is taken through the state by Ridgeway and his two companions, a violent man named Boseman who wears a necklace of human ears, and an odd Black boy named Homer. They also have picked up a runaway named Jasper who constantly sings hymns. The first half of Tennessee they travel through is completely blackened by wildfires. Even the white settlers have been displaced. Halfway into their journey, annoyed by his singing, Ridgeway shoots Jasper in the face. They drive out of the fires, but the next series of towns are in quarantine due to a yellow fever outbreak. Finally, they stop in a town where Cora is acknowledged by a young Black man wearing glasses. After Ridgeway takes Cora to dinner and tells her about Caesar’s death, they stop for the night in the woods outside of town. Boseman tries to rape Cora and Ridgeway punches him. At that instant, the man wearing glasses appears with two others, all armed. One shoots Boseman, another chases Homer, and the man with glasses fights with Ridgeway. Cora jumps on Ridgeway’s back and they subdue him. Homer gets away, Ridgeway is chained to his own wagon, and Cora is rescued.
The man with glasses is Royal, a conductor on the underground railroad, who takes Cora to Valentine farm in Indiana. There she truly lives as a free woman, attending school and contributing to the life of the large farm occupied by free and escaped Black people. She and Royal begin a romance, and she also becomes close to her housemate Sybil and Sybil’s daughter, Molly. Valentine farm was founded by a light-skinned Black man named John Valentine, who often passed for white, and his wife Gloria. Every Saturday night on the farm there is a big feast followed by lectures, poetry readings, singing, and dancing. However, hostility from the nearby white community is growing as the whites feel threatened by the size of the Black community.
Royal takes Cora on a buggy ride and picnic and shows her an abandoned house with an underground railroad station beneath it. It is too small for an actual train and just has a handcar and a narrow tunnel. No one knows where it goes. The experience makes Cora uneasy, since she wants to settle on the Valentine farm and not be forced to flee on the underground railroad anymore. Sam appears on Valentine farm on his way to California and tells Cora that Terrance Randall is dead and no one is looking for her anymore.
On the night that two speakers, Mingo and Lander, debate the future of Valentine farm, a white mob arrives, killing Lander and Royal and many others. They burn down the buildings while the residents flee. Later, people will only know about the farm and the massacre because survivors tell the story to their descendants. Cora is captured by Ridgeway and Homer, who order her to take them to the underground railroad station.
Before the book ends, we learn that Cora’s mother Mabel never made it farther than the swamp bordering the Randall plantation. As she was returning to take care of Cora, she was bitten by a poisonous snake and her body sunk into the swamp.
Cora takes Ridgeway to the abandoned railroad station, where she pulls him down the steps and he is mortally wounded. Homer tends to Ridgeway while Cora pumps the handcar down the tunnel. She travels for miles, then walks until she emerges into daylight. On the trail, she encounters three covered wagons, the last one driven by an older Black man named Ollie. He feeds her and tells her he is going to St. Louis to join a wagon train to California. She joins him and wonders about his story, which he will certainly tell her on the way."
Courier,"Oedipa Maas, the young wife of a man named Mucho, lives in Kinneret, California. One day, she receives a letter from a law firm telling her that her ex-boyfriend, Pierce Inverarity, has died and named her the executor of his estate. Oedipa resolves to faithfully execute her duty, and she travels to San Narciso (Pierce's hometown) where she meets the lawyer, Metzger, assigned to help her, with whom she spontaneously begins an affair.
As they go about sorting through Pierce's tangled financial affairs, Oedipa takes note of the fact that Pierce owned an extensive stamp collection. One night, Oedipa and Metzger go to a bar called The Scope, where they meet Mike Fallopian, a member of a right-wing fanatical organization called the Peter Pinguid Society. In the bathroom of the bar, Oedipa sees a symbol that she later learns is supposed to represent a muted post horn. Written below the symbol are the acronym W.A.S.T.E. and the name ""Kirby."" Oedipa makes a note of all this info before returning to chat with Mike at the bar.
Oedipa and Metzger take a trip one day to Fangoso Lagoons, an area in which Pierce owned a substantial amount of land. There, they meet a man named Manny di Presso, a lawyer who is suing the Inverarity estate on behalf of his client, who recovered and sold human bones to Inverarity but did not receive proper payment. Pierce wanted the bones to make charcoal for cigarette filters. A member of The Paranoids, a hippie band that follows Oedipa around, points out that Manny's story is similar to that of the 17th-century play The Courier's Tragedy. Oedipa and Metzger decide to see a production of the play nearby. The play mentions the word ""Tristero,"" a word that fascinates Oedipa because of its placement within the play. She goes backstage to speak with the director, Randolph Driblette, who tells her to stop overanalyzing the play. She resolves to call him back later.
After rereading Pierce's will later on, Oedipa goes to a stockholders' meeting for the Yoyodyne company, a firm owned in part by Inverarity. After taking a brief tour, she stumbles into the office of Stanley Koteks, who is drawing the muted post horn symbol on his pad of paper. He tells her about a scientist named John Nefastis who has built a type of Mexwell's Demon, or a physically impossible machine that allows for perpetual motion by violating the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Koteks encourages Oedipa to meet with Nefastis.
Wanting to learn more about The Courier's Tragedy, Oedipa gets an anthology of Jacobean revenge plays. She notices that the paperback copy has no mention of the Tristero, however, which puzzles her. She decides to go to Berkeley to meet with the publisher. In the meantime, she stops by an elderly care home that Pierce had owned, where she meets an old man with a ring depicting the muted post horn. She also hires a philatelist (stamp expert) named Genghis Cohen to go through Pierce's stamp collection. After doing so, Genghis tells her that some of Pierce's stamps have a muted post horn in their watermark. Oedipa begins to realize that she is uncovering a large mystery.
Oedipa goes to Berkeley to meet with John Nefastis, who shows her his perpetual motion machine. It can only be operated by people with special mental capabilities allowing them to communicate with the machine, and he tells Oedipa that she has no such mental skills. He then propositions her, causing her to run out screaming. Oedipa then begins a very, very long night of wandering around aimlessly all over the Bay area. She encounters the muted post horn symbol almost everywhere, leading her to believe that she may be hallucinating. Just before dawn, however, she encounters an old man who hands her a letter and asks her to deliver it via W.A.S.T.E. under the freeway. After helping the man to his room, Oedipa finds a W.A.S.T.E. facility under the freeway, drops in the letter and waits for the delivery man, whom she follows to Oakland and back to Berkeley after he picks up the letters and delivers them. Oedipa returns to her home in Kinneret to see her doctor, who begins shooting at her as she pulls up. He has gone crazy, obsessed with the idea that Israelis are coming to kill him because he assisted the Nazis in World War II. After he is arrested, Oedipa sees her husband, Mucho, and spends some time with him, although she quickly sees that he has become addicted to LSD, making it difficult to communicate effectively.
Increasingly alone, Oedipa seeks out Emory Bortz, an English professor at San Narciso College who has extensive knowledge of Jacobean revenge plays. With his help, she pieces together the history of the Tristero, which dates back to mid-16th-century Europe. She learns that Driblette has died, which means she will never know why he included the lines about the Tristero in his production of The Courier's Tragedy (these lines are not ordinarily included in the play). Oedipa begins to give up as she realizes that she is very lonely and has no real friends. She visits Mike Fallopian again, who suggests that the whole Tristero mystery may be nothing more than a huge, complex joke played on her by Pierce. Oedipa will not accept this possibility but realizes that every route leading to the Tristero also leads to the Inverarity Estate. Meanwhile, Genghis Cohen helps her piece together some mysteries about Pierce's stamp collection, which is to be auctioned off by a local dealer as Lot 49. Genghis has heard that a secretive bidder will attend the auction to bid on Lot 49, but he will not reveal himself beforehand. Oedipa goes to the auction, excited to find out who the bidder is, thinking that he may know the key to the Tristero. The novel ends as Oedipa sits in the room waiting for the crying of Lot 49, when she will discover the identity of the mystery bidder."
Transit,"The 57 Bus is about a real-life incident that occurred in Oakland, California, on November 4, 2013. The book’s approach is journalistic. 
Richard, a light-skinned Black teenager, is a junior at Oakland High School. He spent the previous year in a home for boys after getting arrested for fighting. Richard is usually a positive person, often goofing off to try to make people laugh, but he has made some poor choices and often skips school with other students who make poor choices. Richard meets Kaprice Wilson, a school guidance counselor. When she tells him about the program that she runs for underperforming students, he asks if he can join the program voluntarily. After examining Richard’s file, Kaprice accepts him into her program.
Sasha is an agender teenager (identifying as neither male nor female) with Asperger’s who attends Maybeck, a private high school. Sasha was named Luke at birth, but at a young age, Sasha decided that neither gender correctly applied. Sasha chose an androgynous name and uses they/them pronouns. Within a tight-knit group of friends at Maybeck, Sasha feels welcome and supported. They and their friends regularly play a game called 1001 Blank White Cards, where each of the participants has made their own cards, full of in-jokes and silly rules. Sasha forms a close, platonic relationship with Nemo, another agender teenager. Since neither is interested in romance or sex, many people find their relationship confusing.
On November 4, 2013, Sasha rides home on the 57 bus. They fall asleep, tired after a long day at school. Richard and his friend Lloyd also take the bus home after school. When Richard and Lloyd board the bus, they greet their friend Jamal. He gives Richard a lighter. The three boys see Sasha sleeping on the backseat, wearing a skirt. Richard playfully flicks the lighter near Sasha’s skirt, as well as near Lloyd’s sleeve. With encouragement from Jamal, Richard lights Sasha’s skirt before exiting the rear of the bus. By the time Sasha’s skirt bursts into a ball of flame, Richard is staring at the back of the bus, hearing Sasha’s screams as the bus drives away. After the bus pulls over and confused passengers jump out, two men smother Sasha’s burning skirt. Sasha phones their parents, Karl and Debbie, who arrive before the ambulance and see that Sasha’s upper legs are burned badly. An ambulance takes Sasha to a burn unit in San Francisco.
Richard is arrested at school the next day and questioned by police. Without truly understanding the word, Richard states that he is “homophobic.” He tries to cooperate with the police and gives a statement without his mother or a lawyer present. Richard is charged as an adult with multiple felonies, including hate-crime enhancements. Sasha undergoes weeks of painful surgeries. After the story goes viral, Richard is vilified as anti-gay, while Sasha receives support and gifts from all over the world.
While in Juvenile Hall, Richard writes two letters to Sasha, apologizing and explaining that he never meant to hurt them, that he was just trying to pull a prank. Jasmine, Richard’s mother, hires lawyer Bill Du Bois to defend Richard. Du Bois does not deliver Richard’s letters to Sasha, because he thinks that the admission of guilt will hurt Richard’s case. Sasha’s family is encouraged by all of the support that they have received, but they are still confused by the incident.
After a lengthy series of court proceedings, the district attorney offers Richard a plea bargain: if he maintains good behavior in the juvenile system, he can be released by his twenty-first birthday and never have to serve time in adult prison. Over a year after the incident, Du Bois gives Sasha the letters that Richard wrote. Sasha’s family is moved by Richard’s sentiments, and Karl reads a statement at one of Richard’s sentencing hearings, stating that the family has forgiven Richard and hopes that the justice system will be lenient. Richard is given the shorter sentence and allowed to stay within the juvenile system.
Richard does well in the juvenile justice system: he earns his high school diploma, obtains vocational training, and works for a non-profit. He is eventually released before his twenty-first birthday.
Sasha is accepted into the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with the intent to pursue a career in transit. At MIT, they join a fraternity of like-minded individuals and feel welcome. Sasha returns home on winter break and plays a game of 1001 Blank White Cards with their best friend, Michael. Sasha decides to leave all of the cards that reference “Luke” in the deck, and they digitally scan the cards to preserve them forever. Sasha has moved on from the incident and has a bright future."
Appeal,"Lawyer Bryan Stevenson gives a first-person account of his decades helping marginalized Americans who have been unfairly and harshly punished by the U.S. criminal justice system, which disproportionately targets people of color and poor people. At the heart of Just Mercy is the story of Walter McMillian, a Black man who was framed for the murder of a girl named Ronda Morrison, convicted, and sent to death row. 
Stevenson alternates chapters about Walter with his personal reflections on our country’s history with racial disparity and issues around incarceration. Stevenson highlights other groups of vulnerable people who have been victimized by the criminal justice system and shares the stories of the prisoners he has helped over the years. The book also follows the growth of Stevenson’s nonprofit law project, the Alabama-based Equal Justice Initiative (EJI), through its expansion from focusing on death row prisoners to helping people sentenced to life without parole. Stevenson chronicles how EJI becomes a significant force in criminal justice reform.
In 1983 as a law student, Stevenson discovers his life’s passion when he interns with the Georgia-based Southern Prisoners Defense Committee and meets his first death row prisoner. After graduation Stevenson accepts a job with the organization to represent poor prisoners, including those in Alabama who lack any public defender. He meets Walter McMillian on Alabama’s death row. Walter owns a successful business but also transgresses racial boundaries when he has an affair with a white woman. Soon after the affair becomes public, the woman’s friend, Ralph Myers, accuses Walter of committing the unsolved murder of Ronda Morrison, which has outraged the community. Law enforcement, including a racist sheriff and the district attorney, eagerly pounces on this accusation, overlooking Walter’s alibi and a lack of evidence. Instead, they actively force Ralph to stick with his story even when he tries to recant. They coerce other false witness testimonies, and—as revealed years later—actively suppress evidence.
After Stevenson and the team at EJI unsuccessfully appeal Walter’s conviction, they launch their own investigation of the crime and uncover new evidence. They find witnesses who can prove the witnesses against Walter lied as well as financial records that indicate that one of these witnesses was paid to give false testimony. Stevenson and his team also petition for and receive all records from Walter’s trial. However, their big break comes when they receive a phone call from Ralph, who now wants to make amends. Ralph admits to lying about Walter and says he was threatened by law enforcement. Stevenson wins a hearing for Walter where he can present his new evidence: Ralph’s testimony, which is confirmed by health care workers and other inmates, as well as recordings of the law enforcement team threatening Ralph if he doesn’t frame Walter. 
While the judge refuses to grant Walter relief, Stevenson continues the appeal process through the Alabama courts. The district attorney asks outside agents to investigate the murder for which Walter was convicted, and the investigators determine that Walter had nothing to do with the crime. Six weeks later, the court invalidates Walter’s conviction. Stevenson and the State file a joint motion to dismiss the charges, and Walter is set free.
Throughout the process, Stevenson and Walter become close friends, and Stevenson helps Walter upon his release, including filing a civil suit on his behalf and offering him a place to stay. Walter works with Stevenson to share his story, giving interviews and speaking at legal conferences, and Walter is even featured in a documentary. Unfortunately, Walter is diagnosed with advancing dementia and is forced to rely on family and eventually a nursing facility for his care. He dies in 2013. Stevenson gives a eulogy at his funeral and shares all he learned from Walter, particularly that we must extend mercy to everyone, even those who have not earned it.
Interspersed with chapters chronicling Walter’s narrative are stories of Stevenson’s other clients and work. His closeness with these prisoners and their horrifying circumstances makes Stevenson more determined to help and causes him to reflect on abstract issues that nevertheless imbue the criminal justice system, like humanity and mercy. Stevenson focuses on several categories of vulnerable people who become trapped in the system, including mentally ill prisoners, disabled prisoners, and poor women who give birth to stillborn babies. 
Stevenson and his team at EJI also become increasingly focused on juvenile offenders who are sometimes tried as adults despite their young age. These offenders may be given de facto death sentences by being sentenced to life without parole and face perilous circumstances when they are housed in adult prisons. Stevenson illustrates how these prisoners retain their own humanity while being forced to live under inhumane conditions. He also discusses some of the qualities common among these types of prisoners: They are generally poor and disproportionately people of color, and most of them lack adequate legal counsel. The juveniles have horrific backgrounds of abuse and neglect.
Stevenson and his team at EJI also work to change the legal system to offer more protection to marginalized people. Several of his cases end up before the U.S. Supreme Court, and he succeeds in winning rulings that ban as unconstitutional the conviction of children to life without parole and the execution of people deemed incompetent from dementia or neurological disease. EJI works to raise public awareness of issues surrounding unfair incarceration, produces groundbreaking reports on racial issues, and sets up programs to help formerly incarcerated people adjust to life on the outside.
Stevenson also reflects on the issues that surround the criminal justice system. His time spent with prisoners awaiting their execution makes him realize how inhumane it is to prepare another human to die. After decades of work, when Stevenson fails to prevent the execution of a man who suffers from an intellectual disability, he momentarily feels unable to continue his work. However, he realizes that he cannot help but be broken by his experiences and comes to understand that it is his own brokenness that allows him to more fully understand the need for mercy and to bring compassion to others. The book ends with Stevenson’s renewed commitment to helping others."
Various,"Maus: A Survivor’s Tale is the illustrated true story of Vladek Spiegelman’s experiences during World War II, as told by his son, Artie. It consists of Book One: My Father Bleeds History, and Book Two: And Here My Troubles Began / From Mauschwitz to the Catskills and Beyond.
While the story is primarily focused on Vladek’s life, there is also a frame narrative (or, a story within the story) that shows Artie and his father interacting in the present, with Artie asking questions as Vladek relays his experiences. As Vladek describes the horrors that he faced as a Jewish person in World War II, there are interspersed scenes that reveal some of the challenges that Artie faces as the son of a concentration camp survivor. For example, Vladek is obsessive about money and constantly fusses over Artie’s clothes, decisions, and refusal to eat everything on his plate (even though Artie is an adult).
Except for a brief scene that depicts Artie as a human wearing a mouse mask, all of the people in the story appear as anthropomorphic animals. Jews are depicted as mice, Germans as cats, Poles as pigs, French as frogs, and Americans as dogs.
The story begins around 1978, with Artie visiting his father Vladek in New York City. Vladek looks frail and unhealthy; he’s had two heart attacks, and the suicide of his wife Anja (Artie’s mother) a decade earlier has taken a serious toll on him. Vladek is remarried to a woman named Mala with whom he constantly argues. Artie asks Vladek to tell him stories about life during World War II so that he can create a comic book based on Vladek’s experiences. 
Vladek starts his story in 1935, when he was living in Poland. After marrying Anja Zylberberg, Vladek moves to Sosnowiec, Poland, where her wealthy family helps them get established. Vladek and Anja have a son named Richieu, and Anja’s father, a millionaire, gives Vladek money to buy a factory in Bielsko. Vladek runs the factory during the week and returns home to Sosnowiec on the weekends to visit Anja and Richieu. Anja has a breakdown due to severe postpartum depression, and Vladek stays with her in a sanitarium in Czechoslovakia until she recovers. In 1939, Vladek is drafted into the Polish army and sent to the frontlines to fight the Nazis, where he is captured and becomes a prisoner of war. Vladek is eventually released back to Poland, and he returns to Anja and Richieu in Sosnoweic.
As the war continues, the Nazis begin rounding up Jewish people in Sosnowiec and sending them away on trains. Food and resources become scarce, and Vladek begins trading goods on the black market in order to provide for his family. Several of his friends are caught trading goods and executed. The Nazis later order that everyone report to the local stadium to have their papers verified; once there, many Jews are taken away for deportation. Luckily, Vladek’s cousin is working one of the tables at the stadium, and he is able to secure Vladek’s release, as well as Anja’s and her parents’. Vladek’s sister Fela, Fela’s four children, and Vladek’s father are not as fortunate—they are never seen again.
During one of Artie’s visits to help his father and record his stories about World War II, he finds out that his father read a comic he drew years before. The comic, Prisoner on the Hell Planet: A Case History, is included in Maus. It depicts Artie as a prisoner and shows the mental and emotional pain he endured because of his mother’s suicide in 1968.
Continuing on with his story, Vladek says that after leaving the stadium, he and his family were relocated to a ghetto in Srodula. In order to keep Richieu safe, Vladek and Anja send him to live with Anja’s sister Tosha in Zawiercie. They later find out that when Tosha discovered that she and the rest of the Jews in Zawiercie were going to be shipped to Auschwitz, she poisoned Richieu, herself, and her two children in order to spare them a worse fate at the camp.
When Vladek and Anja realize that the Germans are going to send everyone in the ghetto to concentration camps, they go into hiding to avoid capture. Once the ghetto is empty, Vladek and Anja begin to walk back to Sosnowiec. Along the way, they secure passage to Hungary with some smugglers, but the smugglers betray them and hand them over to the Germans. Vladek is sent to Auschwitz, and Anja is taken to Birkenau.
Vladek tells Artie that Anja kept diaries after the war, but Vladek destroyed them in a fit of grief. Artie becomes upset and yells at his father, saying that they would have had valuable information in them. At the beginning of Book Two, while Artie is staying with friends in Vermont, he receives a call from Vladek: Mala has left him and taken some of their shared valuables. Fearing that he will be responsible for taking care of his father, Artie goes to visit him in New York.
Vladek continues his story and describes the terrible conditions in Auschwitz. While working there, he uses his knowledge of trade skills to remain valuable and avoid execution. He learns that Anja is in the secondary camp, Auschwitz Birkenau, and arranges to do some repairs there so that he can see her. After hoarding the few resources available, Vladek bribes some of the Nazi guards to have Anja relocated to his camp to work in the munitions shop.
Vladek continues his story, describing the various ways that he used his skills and resourcefulness to help himself and Anja survive at Auschwitz. As the Russian army closes in on Auschwitz, Vladek is tasked with dismantling the gas chambers. All of the prisoners are eventually evacuated and relocated to Dachau, a camp in Germany. Vladek contracts typhus from the lice at Dachau and becomes very sick. He is sent toward Switzerland by train to be traded as a prisoner of war and is eventually rescued by American soldiers. After traveling back through Germany to Poland, he is reunited with Anja.
When Artie visits his father to hear the last of the story, Vladek is very sick. Mala has returned to help, but is still frustrated by Vladek. When Artie starts to leave, Vladek, confused and tired, calls him Richieu."
Regimes,"Marjane “Marji” Satrapi is an intelligent, spirited, and very modern girl living with her parents in Iran’s capital of Tehran during the eventful period of Iranian history from the late 1970s into the early 1980s. In Persepolis: The Story of a Childhood, Marji’s remembers her life during those years, mostly from when she was about ten to age fourteen. This account includes how Marji and her family lived through and were affected by turbulent events that included the overthrow of the autocratic Shah of Iran by the Islamic revolution, the oppressive fundamentalist regime that replaced the Shah, and the devasting Iran-Iraq war.
The nation’s wealth has long made it a target of outside invaders, but Islamic revolution of 1979 has pushed out the Western-backed government of the Shah.  The revolution has ushered in a new Islamic regime that is bringing massive societal changes impacting how people are supposed to behave--including Marji and her family. Marji struggles to adjust to the changes at her liberal French bilingual school, which has become increasingly stricter. Girls are required to wear veils and female and male students are now separated. Marji’s wealthy and modern parents—her father, Ebi, and her mother, Taji—take part in the massive protests against the new regime’s strict rules on behavior (just as they had previously protested against the Shah’s regime). Marji’s parents worry when a photo of Marji’s mother a protest appears in newspapers magazines. Later, after a demonstration they are at turns violent, the Satrapis decide that openly protesting is too dangerous to continue to do.
Marji feels conflict between her own deeply spiritual feelings and the stark modernism of her parents. She talks to God at night and has believed she will become a prophet one day since she was six years old, Marji. But the revolution leads to Marji setting aside these ambitions while she studies and imitates protestors and revolutionaries. She mimics protestors in the garden of her house and studies books about famous revolutionaries and philosophers given to her by her parents. She fantasizes about becoming a hero and wants her parents to become heroes too. Marji’s relationship with God becomes strained, as she finds that she and God have less to talk about—although God does still come by to see her from time to time.
Marji thrills when she learns that rebels fill her family history. She learns that her grandfather was a prince and later a communist whom the Shah removed from power and that her uncle Anoosh, also a communist, spent nine years in prison during the Shah’s regime. Marji spends a short time with Anoosh, learning about his life. After the Shah fell from power in 1979, Anoosh was released from prison, but when Islamic fundamentalists consolidate their grip on power, they hunt Anoosh down, imprison him, and later execute him. Her new idol killed, Marji feels crushed. She completely abandons her faith in God and increasingly questions the pro-regime propaganda she hears—especially at school.
Marji deeply loves and identifies with of her parents, even if she does sometimes feel that their actions and behavior (as wealthy and privileged individuals) do not always live up to their pro-democratic and liberal rhetoric. Marji also has a special connection with her grandmother, who remains stoic and inspiring to Marji in spite of the turmoil and numerous tragedies stemming from political actions that impact her and the family. Marji’s uncle Anoosh is not Marji’s only direct experience with the cruel consequences of the government’s actions. Throughout the book, death and devastation occurs among Marji’s extended family and friends as direct results of the brutality and fanaticism of the Iranian regimes and the war with Iraq.
People had rejoiced when the Shah was forced out, but as Islamic fundamentalists retain power, Marji and her family watch as their neighbors’ behavior shifts back and forth to coincide with the current political winds. The neighbors go from wearing short skirts and drinking alcohol to covering themselves and denouncing the use of alcohol. Marji’s parents ask her to tell everyone that she prays every day, a lie they hope will keep Marji safe, but acknowledge that the rules seem foolish. Marji grows more rebellious, as she increasingly views the rules at school and elsewhere as hypocritical and difficult to follow. Armed with more knowledge and personal experience, Marji begins to act out in ways that put her safety at risk. In fact, she even (accidentally) hits her principal during an argument, which results in her expulsion from school. Fearing her rebellious behavior will get her killed, Marji’s mother tries to reason with Marji by telling her that it is not her responsibility to serve justice and that the bad guys eventually pay for their sins in the end.
The war with Iraq had originally inspired Marji to vocal patriotism in protection her country against another invasion, but Marji begins to realize there are greater forces behind the war. She sees how the Islamic regime needs the war to continue survive and keep power. The war promotes a sense of nationalism and pride in the public, and those who die in the war are hailed as “martyrs.” Marji sees thousands of poor boys lured into war without proper training. She becomes increasingly uncomfortable and aware of class differences within society. Poor young boys are lured into the army with gold-painted keys to the “kingdom of heaven” to help them enter paradise after dying on the battlefield, while children in her wealthy neighborhood are left alone.
More and more people try to escape Iran as the borders tighten and Iraqi forces bomb Tehran and other Iranian cities. Realizing that Marji’s chances of escaping Iran are narrowing, her parents make the difficult decision to send her abroad alone to finish school in Vienna, explaining that only a good education will free her of Iran. Marji feels heartbroken. She spends one last night with her grandmother, who gives her warm advice and inspires her to be compassionate and understanding while in Vienna. Marji gives away all of her prized contraband to her friends, including a Kim Wilde poster. At the airport, as Marji turns to say goodbye to her parents one last time to see that her mother, devasted by her only child’s departure, has fainted."
Desires,"Blanche DuBois, a schoolteacher from Laurel, Mississippi, arrives at the New Orleans apartment of her sister, Stella Kowalski. Despite the fact that Blanche seems to have fallen out of close contact with Stella, she intends to stay at Stella’s apartment for an unspecified but likely lengthy period of time, given the large trunk she has with her. Blanche tells Stella that she lost Belle Reve, their ancestral home, following the death of all their remaining relatives. She also mentions that she has been given a leave of absence from her teaching position because of her bad nerves.
Though Blanche does not seem to have enough money to afford a hotel, she is disdainful of the cramped quarters of the Kowalskis’ two-room apartment and of the apartment’s location in a noisy, diverse, working-class neighborhood. Blanche’s social condescension wins her the instant dislike of Stella’s husband, an auto-parts supply man of Polish descent named Stanley Kowalski. It is clear that Stella was happy to leave behind her the social pretensions of her background in exchange for the sexual gratification she gets from her husband; she even is pregnant with his baby. Stanley immediately distrusts Blanche to the extent that he suspects her of having cheated Stella out of her share of the family inheritance. In the process of defending herself to Stanley, Blanche reveals that Belle Reve was lost due to a foreclosed mortgage, a disclosure that signifies the dire nature of Blanche’s financial circumstances. Blanche’s heavy drinking, which she attempts to conceal from her sister and brother-in-law, is another sign that all is not well with Blanche.
The unhappiness that accompanies the animal magnetism of Stella and Stanley’s marriage reveals itself when Stanley hosts a drunken poker game with his male friends at the apartment. Blanche gets under Stanley’s skin, especially when she starts to win the affections of his close friend Mitch. After Mitch has been absent for a while, speaking with Blanche in the bedroom, Stanley erupts, storms into the bedroom, and throws the radio out of the window. When Stella yells at Stanley and defends Blanche, Stanley beats her. The men pull him off, the poker game breaks up, and Blanche and Stella escape to their upstairs neighbor Eunice’s apartment. A short while later, Stanley is remorseful and cries up to Stella to forgive him. To Blanche’s alarm, Stella returns to Stanley and embraces him passionately. Mitch meets Blanche outside of the Kowalski flat and comforts her in her distress.
The next day, Blanche tries to convince Stella to leave Stanley for a better man whose social status equals Stella’s. Blanche suggests that she and Stella contact a millionaire named Shep Huntleigh for help escaping from New Orleans; when Stella laughs at her, Blanche reveals that she is completely broke. Stanley walks in as Blanche is making fun of him and secretly overhears Blanche and Stella’s conversation. Later, he threatens Blanche with hints that he has heard rumors of her disreputable past. She is visibly dismayed.
While Blanche is alone in the apartment one evening, waiting for Mitch to pick her up for a date, a teenage boy comes by to collect money for the newspaper. Blanche doesn’t have any money for him, but she hits on him and gives him a lustful kiss. Soon after the boy departs, Mitch arrives, and they go on their date. When Blanche returns, she is exhausted and clearly has been uneasy for the entire night about the rumors Stanley mentioned earlier. In a surprisingly sincere heart-to-heart discussion with Mitch, Blanche reveals the greatest tragedy of her past. Years ago, her young husband committed suicide after she discovered and chastised him for his homosexuality. Mitch describes his own loss of a former love, and he tells Blanche that they need each other.
When the next scene begins, about one month has passed. It is the afternoon of Blanche’s birthday. Stella is preparing a dinner for Blanche, Mitch, Stanley, and herself, when Stanley comes in to tell her that he has learned news of Blanche’s sordid past. He says that after losing the DuBois mansion, Blanche moved into a fleabag motel from which she was eventually evicted because of her numerous sexual liaisons. Also, she was fired from her job as a schoolteacher because the principal discovered that she was having an affair with a teenage student. Stella is horrified to learn that Stanley has told Mitch these stories about Blanche.
The birthday dinner comes and goes, but Mitch never arrives. Stanley indicates to Blanche that he is aware of her past. For a birthday present, he gives her a one-way bus ticket back to Laurel. Stanley’s cruelty so disturbs Stella that it appears the Kowalski household is about to break up, but the onset of Stella’s labor prevents the imminent fight.
Several hours later, Blanche, drunk, sits alone in the apartment. Mitch, also drunk, arrives and repeats all he’s learned from Stanley. Eventually Blanche confesses that the stories are true, but she also reveals the need for human affection she felt after her husband’s death. Mitch tells Blanche that he can never marry her, saying she isn’t fit to live in the same house as his mother. Having learned that Blanche is not the chaste lady she pretended to be, Mitch tries to have sex with Blanche, but she forces him to leave by yelling “Fire!” to attract the attention of passersby outside.
Later, Stanley returns from the hospital to find Blanche even more drunk. She tells him that she will soon be leaving New Orleans with her former suitor Shep Huntleigh, who is now a millionaire. Stanley knows that Blanche’s story is entirely in her imagination, but he is so happy about his baby that he proposes they each celebrate their good fortune. Blanche spurns Stanley, and things grow contentious. When she tries to step past him, he refuses to move out of her way. Blanche becomes terrified to the point that she smashes a bottle on the table and threatens to smash Stanley in the face. Stanley grabs her arm and says that it’s time for the “date” they’ve had set up since Blanche’s arrival. Blanche resists, but Stanley uses his physical strength to overcome her, and he carries her to bed. The pulsing music indicates that Stanley rapes Blanche.
The next scene takes place weeks later, as Stella and her neighbor Eunice pack Blanche’s bags. Blanche is in the bath, and Stanley plays poker with his buddies in the front room. A doctor will arrive soon to take Blanche to an insane asylum, but Blanche believes she is leaving to join her millionaire. Stella confesses to Eunice that she simply cannot allow herself to believe Blanche’s assertion that Stanley raped her. When Blanche emerges from the bathroom, her deluded talk makes it clear that she has lost her grip on reality.
The doctor arrives with a nurse, and Blanche initially panics and struggles against them when they try to take her away. Stanley and his friends fight to subdue Blanche, while Eunice holds Stella back to keep her from interfering. Mitch begins to cry. Finally, the doctor approaches Blanche in a gentle manner and convinces her to leave with him. She allows him to lead her away and does not look back or say goodbye as she goes. Stella sobs with her child in her arms, and Stanley comforts her with loving words and caresses."
Retaining,"Babbitt is set in the modern Midwestern city of Zenith. George F. Babbitt, a 46- year-old real estate broker, enjoys all the modern conveniences available to a prosperous middle-class businessman, yet he is dissatisfied with his life. When the novel opens, Babbitt has begun to regularly indulge in fantasies about a fairy girl who makes him feel like a gallant youth. Babbitt's family consists of his three children, Verona, Ted, and Tinka, and his dowdy, devoted wife, Myra.
Babbitt's closest friend Paul Riesling is even more dissatisfied with his life. He is also more vocal about it. Although he dreamed of becoming a professional violinist in his youth, Riesling became mired in the life of the average middle-class businessman of his generation. His wife, Zilla, is equally unsatisfied with the monotonous, conventional routine of Zenith, but she vents her frustrations by constantly nagging Paul. Riesling has often spoken of divorcing his wife, but, like Babbitt's frequent declarations that he is going to quit smoking, he never follows through.
Riesling and Babbitt try to ameliorate their dissatisfaction by taking a vacation in Maine together, but their enjoyment at their newfound freedom is short-lived. They eventually have to return to their lives as middle-aged married men. Both men experience a growing impulse to rebel against social conventions. When Babbitt discovers that Riesling is having an affair, he preaches the value of maintaining one's good social standing in the community. Riesling retorts that his life is miserable, so he doesn't feel guilty for seeking a little comfort in the arms of another woman. Soon thereafter, Riesling and Zilla have another argument; Riesling snaps, shoots his wife, and subsequently receives a sentence of three years in the state penitentiary.
Babbitt is devastated by the loss of Riesling's steadying presence in his life. His own desire for rebellion comes to the surface when he realizes that he wants his fairy girl in the flesh. When the attractive widow, Tanis Judique, enters his life, Babbitt thinks he has found his fairy girl and begins an affair. At the same time, Babbitt becomes more critical of the conservative opinions of his friends. When the threat of a general strike hangs over Zenith, Babbitt ventures to support some of the claims of the strikers, shocking and alienating his social set. While Myra is away nursing her sick sister, Babbitt stays out late, drinking and partying with Tanis' bohemian friends.
Babbitt's friends do not fail to take notice of his rebellion. They attempt to coax him back into their inner circle, but Babbitt remains defiant. Upon her return to Zenith, Myra becomes suspicious of Babbitt's activities. When he finally admits to her that he is having an affair, he convinces her that it is her fault. However, Babbitt becomes disillusioned with Tanis when he realizes that in many ways, her life is just as conventional as his. Meanwhile, Babbitt's friends try to bully him into returning to his old ways. When Babbitt refuses to conform, they shun him, and his business begins to suffer.
When Myra falls seriously ill with appendicitis, Babbitt realizes that it is too late to become a rebel. He once again becomes a devoted husband and deeply regrets the pain he has caused his wife. Babbitt's friends offer their support during the crisis. Babbitt gratefully accepts the chance to resume his old life and quickly regains his respectable social status.
Meanwhile, when Ted shocks everyone by eloping with Eunice Littlefield, Babbitt takes him aside to speak with him privately. Although he wants Ted to go to college, Babbitt accepts that Ted himself wants to drop out and work as a mechanic. Babbitt explains to his son that he never did anything he wanted to do with his life. Therefore, he urges Ted to resist the heavy pressure to conform to the expectations of others. Babbitt acknowledges that it is too late for him to rebel, but Ted still has a chance to achieve happiness on his own terms."
Naturalization,"Anne’s diary begins on her thirteenth birthday, June 12, 1942, and ends shortly after her fifteenth. At the start of her diary, Anne describes fairly typical girlhood experiences, writing about her friendships with other girls, her crushes on boys, and her academic performance at school. Because anti-Semitic laws forced Jews into separate schools, Anne and her older sister, Margot, attended the Jewish Lyceum in Amsterdam.
	The Franks had moved to the Netherlands in the years leading up to World War II to escape persecution in Germany. After the Germans invaded the Netherlands in 1940, the Franks were forced into hiding. With another family, the van Daans, and an acquaintance, Mr. Dussel, they moved into a small secret annex above Otto Frank’s office where they had stockpiled food and supplies. The employees from Otto’s firm helped hide the Franks and kept them supplied with food, medicine, and information about the outside world.
	The residents of the annex pay close attention to every development of the war by listening to the radio. Some bits of news catch Anne’s attention and make their way into her diary, providing a vivid historical context for her personal thoughts. The adults make optimistic bets about when the war will end, and their mood is severely affected by Allied setbacks or German advances. Amsterdam is devastated by the war during the two years the Franks are in hiding. All of the city’s residents suffer, since food becomes scarce and robberies more frequent.
	Anne often writes about her feelings of isolation and loneliness. She has a tumultuous relationship with the adults in the annex, particularly her mother, whom she considers lacking in love and affection. She adores her father, but she is frequently scolded and criticized by Mr. and Mrs. van Daan and Mr. Dussel. Anne thinks that her sister, Margot, is smart, pretty, and agreeable, but she does not feel close to her and does not write much about her. Anne eventually develops a close friendship with Peter van Daan, the teenage boy in the annex. Mr. Frank does not approve, however, and the intensity of Anne’s infatuation begins to lessen.
	Anne matures considerably throughout the course of her diary entries, moving from detailed accounts of basic activities to deeper, more profound thoughts about humanity and her own personal nature. She finds it difficult to understand why the Jews are being singled out and persecuted. Anne also confronts her own identity. Though she considers herself to be German, her German citizenship has been revoked, and though she calls Holland her home, many of the Dutch have turned against the Jews. Anne feels a tremendous solidarity with her aggrieved people, and yet at the same time she wants to be seen as an individual rather than a member of a persecuted group.
During the two years recorded in her diary, Anne deals with confinement and deprivation, as well as the complicated and difficult issues of growing up in the brutal circumstances of the Holocaust. Her diary describes a struggle to define herself within this climate of oppression. Anne’s diary ends without comment on August 1, 1944, the end of a seemingly normal day that leaves us with the expectation of seeing another entry on the next page. However, the Frank family is betrayed to the Nazis and arrested on August 4, 1944. Anne’s diary, the observations of an imaginative, friendly, sometimes petty, and rather normal teenage girl, comes to an abrupt and silent end. 
Otto Frank is the family’s sole survivor, and he recovers Anne’s diary from Miep. He decides to fulfill Anne’s wishes by publishing the diary. Anne’s diary becomes a condemnation of the unimaginable horror of the Holocaust, and one of the few accounts that describe it from a young person’s perspective.
	Since Anne’s diary is a true personal account of a life in hiding, it is inappropriate to analyze it as a novel or other work of fiction. Parts of the diary were intended for public view, but others clearly were not. To appreciate and interpret the diary, it is necessary to consider its horrible context, World War II and the Holocaust, before any discussion of plot development or thematic content."
Weak,"The Unbearable Lightness of Being opens with a philosophical discussion of lightness versus heaviness. Kundera contrasts Nietzsche's philosophy of eternal return, or of heaviness, with Parmenides's understanding of life as light. Kundera wonders if any meaning or weight can be attributed to life, since there is no eternal return: if man only has the opportunity to try one path, to make one decision, he cannot return to take a different path, and then compare the two lives. Without the ability to co mpare lives, Kundera argues, we cannot find meaning; where meaning should exist we find only an unbearable weightlessness. The uncertain existence of meaning, and the opposition of lightness and heaviness, the key dichotomy of The Unbearable Lightness of Being, sets the stage for the entire novel.
The year is 1968. The protagonist, Tomas, a brilliant Prague surgeon, pursues a philosophy of lightness in his erotic adventures and exploits. Briefly married in the past, he neither sees nor wishes to see his ex-wife or young son and is comfortably established as a perpetual bachelor. He meets Tereza, a café waitress in a town he visits, and realizes when she follows him to Prague that she intends to ""offer him up her life."" A determined libertine, he momentarily resists his budding roma ntic feelings for her, then gives in to his love.
Tereza had been living a frustrated life as a waitress in a small town, and dreamed of escaping, especially from her vulgar mother. She recognizes in Tomas an intellectual and dreamer, and falls in love with him instantly. The two live together, but Tomas is unable to give up his mistresses. For a while he hides his infidelity from Teresa. Eventually he admits to it, but claims that his sexuality is entirely separate from his love for her. Tereza, unable to accept his behavior or adopt a light attitud e towards sex, suffers increasingly from nightmares, and contemplates suicide.
To keep Tereza happy, Tomas marries her. He keeps his mistresses, however, including his closest friend and long-term lover Sabina, a beautiful, reckless, and talented painter. In spite of herself, Tereza is charmed by Sabina's openness and light-heartedness, and the two women grow friendly. Sabina finds Tereza a job in Prague as a photographer. Despite her friendship with Sabina, however, Tereza's jealousy of Tomas does not slacken.
The events of the Prague Spring result in the Soviet military occupation of the city. Tomas, who in the past wrote an article condemning the Czech Communists, is warned to leave. Sabina flees first, and later Tomas and Tereza join her in Switzerland. Tereza, who found some fulfillment in her job as photographer in Prague, realizes that in Zurich she is jobless and must sit at home while Tomas continues having affairs. She decides that ""when the strong were too weak to hurt the weak, the weak had to be strong enough to leave,"" and returns to Prague. Tomas attempts to enjoy his newly recovered freedom for a few days, then gives up and returns to Prague and Tereza. The return truly means giving up freedom—there is no chance that the couple will be allo wed to leave again. In Prague, Tomas's political troubles escalate. He loses his position as surgeon for refusing to sign a denunciation of his anti-Communist article. Both the Communist regime and underground dissidents attempt to seduce him to their side. His own son reappears as a young dissident and preaches to Tomas with no success, for Tomas hates the idea of being used politically in the same way Sabina hates artistic kitsch. In the end, Tomas seeks obscurity in a job washing windows. His fame persists, however, and he continues seducing the women he works for.
Tereza, now a bartender, in a moment of desperation has an affair with a tall engineer who comes to her bar. She does so in hopes of coming closer to Tomas's way of life; instead she grows more miserable and becomes convinced the man was a police agent hired to gather potential blackmailing material. After many scenes and nightmares, she convinces Tomas to move with her to the country. This means giving up their way of life entirely, and an end to Tomas's erotic adventures.
After living peacefully in the country for some time, Tomas and Tereza are killed one night in a driving accident; they die instantly and together.
In Geneva, Sabina has a love affair with Franz, a university professor and idealistic intellectual who has more in common emotionally with Tereza than Sabina—he imbues his life with heavy meaning. He views Sabina as a romantic and courageous Czech dissident, and is tortured that he must betray his wife Marie-Claude in order to see her. Sabina loves Franz but their views on betrayal differ dramatically; whereas he hates the idea of betrayal, she views betrayal as the first step towards ""going off into the unknown,"" the most glorious thing she can think of.
When Franz leaves his wife and expects to move in with her, Sabina abruptly leaves Switzerland. Sabina leaves Geneva for Paris and then Paris for America; she learns of Tomas and Tereza's deaths from a letter and understands her last link to the past has been broken. She ends up living with an elderly American couple and wondering if she has reached the end of her perpetual flight.
Franz remains separated from his wife. After Sabina's betrayal, he finds consolation with a young student, a girl in over-sized glasses who loves him simply. Franz never accepts that he clearly misunderstood Sabina, but continues to hold her image as in ideal in his head, (wrongly) thinking his decisions in life would have made her proud. At his death, his wife reclaims Franz's body and orders the words ""A return after long wanderings"" written on his tombstone."
California,"Two migrant workers, George and Lennie, have been let off a bus miles away from the California farm where they are due to start work. George is a small, dark man with “sharp, strong features.” Lennie, his companion, is his opposite, a giant of a man with a “shapeless” face. Overcome with thirst, the two stop in a clearing by a pool and decide to camp for the night. As the two converse, it becomes clear that Lennie has an intellectual disability, and is deeply devoted to George and dependent upon him for protection and guidance. George finds that Lennie, who loves petting soft things but often accidentally kills them, has been carrying and stroking a dead mouse. George angrily throws it away, fearing that Lennie might catch a disease from the dead animal. George complains loudly that his life would be easier without having to care for Lennie, but the reader senses that their friendship and devotion is mutual. He and Lennie share a dream of buying their own piece of land, farming it, and, much to Lennie’s delight, keeping rabbits. George ends the night by treating Lennie to the story he often tells him about what life will be like in such an idyllic place.
The next day, the men report to the nearby ranch. George, fearing how the boss will react to Lennie, insists that he’ll do all the talking. He lies, explaining that they travel together because they are cousins and that a horse kicked Lennie in the head when he was a child. They are hired. They meet Candy, an old “swamper,” or handyman, with a missing hand and an ancient dog, and Curley, the boss’s mean-spirited son. Curley is newly married, possessive of his flirtatious wife, and full of jealous suspicion. Once George and Lennie are alone in the bunkhouse, Curley’s wife appears and flirts with them. Lennie thinks she is “purty,” but George, sensing the trouble that could come from tangling with this woman and her husband, warns Lennie to stay away from her. Soon, the ranch-hands return from the fields for lunch, and George and Lennie meet Slim, the skilled mule driver who wields great authority on the ranch. Slim comments on the rarity of friendship like that between George and Lennie. Carlson, another ranch-hand, suggests that since Slim’s dog has just given birth, they should offer a puppy to Candy and shoot Candy’s old, good-for-nothing dog.
The next day, George confides in Slim that he and Lennie are not cousins, but have been friends since childhood. He tells how Lennie has often gotten them into trouble. For instance, they were forced to flee their last job because Lennie tried to touch a woman’s dress and was accused of rape. Slim agrees to give Lennie one of his puppies, and Carlson continues to badger Candy to kill his old dog. When Slim agrees with Carlson, saying that death would be a welcome relief to the suffering animal, Candy gives in. Carlson, before leading the dog outside, promises to do the job painlessly.
Slim goes to the barn to do some work, and Curley, who is maniacally searching for his wife, heads to the barn to accost Slim. Candy overhears George and Lennie discussing their plans to buy land, and offers his life’s savings if they will let him live there too. The three make a pact to let no one else know of their plan. Slim returns to the bunkhouse, berating Curley for his suspicions. Curley, searching for an easy target for his anger, finds Lennie and picks a fight with him. Lennie crushes Curley’s hand in the altercation. Slim warns Curley that if he tries to get George and Lennie fired, he will be the laughingstock of the farm.
The next night, most of the men go to the local brothel. Lennie is left with Crooks, the lonely, Black stable-hand, and Candy. Curley’s wife flirts with them, refusing to leave until the other men come home. She notices the cuts on Lennie’s face and suspects that he, and not a piece of machinery as Curley claimed, is responsible for hurting her husband. This thought amuses her. The next day, Lennie accidentally kills his puppy in the barn. Curley’s wife enters and consoles him. She admits that life with Curley is a disappointment, and wishes that she had followed her dream of becoming a movie star. Lennie tells her that he loves petting soft things, and she offers to let him feel her hair. When he grabs too tightly, she cries out. In his attempt to silence her, he accidentally breaks her neck.
Lennie flees back to a pool of the Salinas River that George had designated as a meeting place should either of them get into trouble. As the men back at the ranch discover what has happened and gather together a lynch party, George joins Lennie. Much to Lennie’s surprise, George is not mad at him for doing “a bad thing.” George begins to tell Lennie the story of the farm they will have together. As he describes the rabbits that Lennie will tend, the sound of the approaching lynch party grows louder. George shoots his friend in the back of the head.
When the other men arrive, George lets them believe that Lennie had the gun, and George wrestled it away from him and shot him. Only Slim understands what has really happened, that George has killed his friend out of mercy. Slim consolingly leads him away, and the other men, completely puzzled, watch them leave."
Arrive,"Bri Jackson, the narrator of the novel, is a 16-year-old girl from Garden Heights, a predominantly Black inner-city neighborhood. Bri has her sights set on rap stardom, hoping to follow in the footsteps of her late father, the underground rap star Lawless. As the novel opens, Bri is nervously awaiting the phone call that could be her big break: an invitation to perform in the Ring, a local club where up-and-coming rappers face off in “battles.” But first, she must endure her ACT prep class at Midtown School of the Arts so she can get her confiscated phone back from her teacher. Bri’s two best friends from Garden Heights, Sonny and Malik, are in the class with her. Like many of the other students of color at Midtown Academy, they are bused in from less affluent neighborhoods. 
By the time Bri finally gets the call to battle at the Ring, both her teacher and her mother, Jay, have reminded her that school, not rap, is the key to her future. But Bri remains fixated on rap stardom as the solution to her family’s financial problems, especially after she learns that Jay, a recovering drug addict, has lost her job. Bri’s Aunt Pooh, a gang member and a drug dealer, escorts Bri to the battle at the Ring, where she squares off with Milez, another teen rapper. In the first round of the battle, Milez raps about Lawless’s murder, shocking Bri and causing her to freeze up when it is her turn to rap. But she soon recovers and outperforms Milez in the next two rounds, winning the battle decisively. By the following morning, a video of the battle is on YouTube and all Bri’s classmates are praising her for her skills.  
Bri’s celebration is short-lived, however. Tate and Long, two school security guards who have a reputation for targeting Black and Latinx students, single Bri out to have her bag searched. When Bri objects, they violently throw her to the ground and cuff her. Bri is suspended for having candy—which her principal refers to as ""contraband—in her backpack. The security guards are suspended too, pending an investigation, but rumors circulate around the school that Bri is a drug dealer.   
Angry about the assault and people’s racist assumptions about her, Bri writes and records a defiant song called “On the Come Up.” In the song, Bri rails against racist police and other authority figures. She also boasts about having a gun and being ready to use it—because that’s what people expect anyway—even though she barely knows anything about guns. Bri shares the recording with Supreme, her father’s old manager, who promises to make her famous. Supreme releases “On the Come Up” online, where it gets picked up by a Black gossip blog and goes viral. Many of Bri’s friends love the song, but Aunt Pooh, Malik, and Trey all chastise Bri for misrepresenting herself and rapping about gang violence that she has never taken part in.  
Real violence breaks out when Tate and Long are reinstated as the school security guards. Students of color protest outside the school while chanting some of the violent lyrics from “On the Come Up.” When Tate and Long warn them to stop, some students attack the security guards, and a riot ensues. A local news station reports that Bri’s song incited the violence. Jay sees the newscast, learns about Bri’s song for the first time, and insists that Bri stop rapping, lay low, and focus on school. Instead, Bri takes to Instagram and is interviewed by a local radio show, defiantly claiming on both platforms that she won’t be silenced. During the radio interview, Bri has to be restrained after DJ Hype insults her with sexist taunts. Bri begins to feel as though she’s becoming the violent person that others assume she is.  
Meanwhile, Bri’s family continues to struggle, falling behind on bills and rent. The electric company shuts off the power and the landlord threatens eviction. Jay quits school, setting aside her dreams so she can become eligible for food stamps. To make matters worse, the Crowns, a rival gang, rob Bri and Malik at gunpoint, taking her father’s gold chain. Aunt Pooh vows to get revenge on the Crowns and disappears for ten days. When she returns, Aunt Pooh is arrested in a drug bust and taken to jail while Bri looks on.  
With her family’s struggles in mind, Bri goes to a recording studio again, this time with Supreme. Supreme encourages Bri to embrace the persona of a “hoodlum” in her music because that is what people expect of Black rappers. He has another rapper write a song for Bri to record. Even though Bri does not agree with the lyrics, she reluctantly agrees to record the song, hoping to impress a white record executive.  
Bri returns to the Ring once more, where she is supposed to perform the song she recorded. Instead, Bri freestyles her own lyrics about refusing to be what people think she should be. The record executive angrily walks out, but the crowd goes wild. Later, an unnamed celebrity retweets the video of Bri’s freestyle and calls her the future of hip-hop. Bri decides that she will pursue a rap career, but only if she can do it on her own terms."
Vast,"Shirin and her family are American Muslims. Her parents come from Iran, but she and her brother Navid were both born in the United States. Her parents move the family often in an ongoing effort to live in bigger homes in better neighborhoods to improve their opportunities for the future. As the story opens, Shirin and Navid are starting at a new high school for the third time in two years. Shirin is sixteen and a sophomore, while Navid, who is very protective of his sister, is a senior. A Very Wide Expanse of Sea tells Shirin’s story during that sophomore year.
A year has passed since 9/11, and because Shirin always wears a hijab, she is harassed and teased by other students. Once, just after the terrorist attacks, several boys attacked Shirin and choked her with her scarf. Because of the racism and prejudice Shirin has experienced throughout her life, she has developed a thick skin. At school, she talks to no one, looks at no one, and does her best to stay under the radar. She has a quick temper, however, and automatically assumes that anyone looking at her or talking to her has malicious or racist intent. Navid, who is far more outgoing than Shirin, starts a breakdancing team with his friends Jacobi, Carlos, and Bijan. He then invites Shirin to join them, which she does. They get a teacher to sponsor the activity, which means they get a room to practice in after school.
Shirin meets a boy named Ocean when they are partnered in biology class to dissect a cat. Because they still have to write a report, she gives him her phone number, and their friendship begins even if it gets off to a rocky start. As they get to know each other, Ocean expresses interest in Shirin’s family and her culture, and they begin texting and talking on the phone. Ocean and Shirin are also both in a class called Global Perspectives, which is taught by Mr. Jordan. When Mr. Jordan uses Shirin to illustrate a point about prejudice, Shirin gets upset and leaves class. Concerned, Ocean follows her, and the two sit at an IHOP and talk, feeling a mutual attraction. 
At lunch one day, Shirin meets a boy named Yusef, another Muslim, who is a senior. At practice, Jacobi tells Shirin that her constant anger is not healthy, which makes her question her defensiveness. Shirin attempts to drop Mr. Jordan’s class, but then he apologizes to her and asks her to return to class, which she does. Ocean tries to get to know her more, and one day they collide in the hallway and accidentally embrace. The physical contact exhilarates them both, and they soon admit their strong feelings for each other. Shirin believes that their relationship will not be good for either of them because of their fellow students’ bigotry. She tries to avoid Ocean, but she finds that she cannot. One day, they kiss in Ocean’s car during lunch, and other students see them. Word spreads quickly that they are a couple.
Shirin discovers that Ocean is a junior and a star basketball player on whom the school and varsity team depend to win championships. She realizes she had no idea what a big deal he was. Ocean confides in Shirin, telling her he doesn’t like playing basketball but doesn’t want to let down his mother, Coach Hart, the team, or the school. Ocean tells Shirin about his parents’ divorce and his mother’s inheritance. Ramadan arrives, and Shirin’s family begins their fasting, which Shirin likes but Navid hates. Shirin invites Ocean to attend a breakdancing event with her one Saturday night, and Navid gives them one hour alone afterward. During their time alone, Ocean takes Shirin to the park where he learned to play basketball. When Shirin expresses her concern for his unhappiness, Ocean feels moved by her compassion for him.
Ocean attends Thanksgiving dinner at Shirin’s house and falls in love with her family and the food. In her room, they kiss again, until Navid cuts their time alone short when he knocks on the door. Later, on the phone, Ocean admits that he is falling in love. As he and Shirin are both tired of hiding their relationship, Shirin agrees to let Ocean drive her to school. In the parking lot, someone calls her “Aladdin,” and someone else throws a cinnamon roll at her, which gets frosting all over her face and scarf. When she goes to the bathroom to wash up, a girl snaps a photo of her without her hijab on and posts it online for the entire school to see. 
Later, Navid and the other breakdancers attack the person who threw the roll. Someone posts a letter accusing Ocean of being a terrorist sympathizer because Shirin is his girlfriend. Coach Hart tells Ocean to stay away from Shirin, but Ocean refuses. Coach Hart then screams at Shirin for ruining Ocean’s life and jeopardizing his scholarship. Even Ocean’s mother, Linda, approaches Shirin and tries to talk her into breaking up with Ocean. Linda admits that she has spent Ocean’s college money, so he needs a basketball scholarship to continue his education. Ocean begs Shirin not to break up with him, but she wants to protect him, so she begins avoiding him completely. Ocean is heartbroken. After he sees her with Yusef, who has joined their breakdancing team, Ocean is suspended for fighting.
After Navid’s breakdancing team wins the school talent show, students begin to change their attitudes toward Shirin, and their hypocrisy angers her. One day, Ocean approaches her locker, and they share how much they miss each other. When Shirin returns to her locker after breakdancing practice, she realizes she never locked it. While nothing has been stolen, she notes that her journal has been moved from the bottom to the top, and she suspects Ocean read it. She feels upset by this idea but also grateful that he might now know her deep, true feelings for him. After Ocean gets suspended again—this time for breaking Coach Hart’s nose, he appears at Shirin’s house one morning, and they skip school together. 
Back at Ocean’s house, Ocean apologizes for reading Shirin’s journal, and they kiss again. When they embrace, Shirin notes that it feels like they have been drowning in a very large expanse of sea. Ocean’s mother hires a lawyer for his hearing. After the hearing, Ocean avoids getting expelled from school, but he quits the basketball team. Shirin and Ocean spend the last few months of the school year together and happy, but at the end of the year, Shirin’s family moves again. Ocean stands in the street and watches Shirin and her family drive away. When he is no longer in sight and just when Shirin feels her heart will break, Ocean texts her, “Don’t give up on me.” The story ends with Shirin stating, “And I never did.”"

Thirteen,"Clay Jensen is a diligent high school student. He is close to being class valedictorian and almost always chooses to study on weekends instead of going to parties. Clay’s classmate, Hannah Baker, has recently taken her own life. After Hannah’s suicide, Clay receives a package in the mail with no return address. When he opens it, he a shoebox containing seven two-sided audio cassettes with the A and B sides numbered in sequential order.
We learn that the tapes were recorded by Hannah just prior taking her own life, and that on thirteen of the fourteen sides she described troubling events leading up to her suicide. Thirteen Reasons Why follows Clay as he travels around town, with the aid of a map that Hannah created, listening to Hannah’s voiceover as she describes the events (one per tape side) and the key individuals involved in them—all of whom Hannah holds culpable in some way for her decision to take her own life. Clay, who was not close friends with Hannah, is initially puzzled about why he was sent the tapes, but as he listens to more and more of her disturbing stories, he belatedly begins to understand that he had an important place in Hannah’s world and psyche. 
Clay listens to the first tape on an old stereo his family’s garage. He hears Hannah say that she will explain why she took her own life, but that anyone listening to the tapes is one of the reasons she did so. Hannah says that whoever receives the tapes should listen to them and then send them on to the next person listed. She warns that if anyone either tries to avoid listening to the tapes or doesn’t pass them on, a backup set of the tapes will be released. In addition to the tapes, each recipient has received a map with different places marked, so that they can travel around town to each location mentioned in Hannah’s story.
On Cassette 1, Side A, Hannah tells of dating Justin Foley, who was her first kiss. They dated for a month, but when rumors started to circulate (some of them originating with Justin), Hannah gained a reputation for being promiscuous. Hannah addresses this on the tape with the statement, “Hannah Baker is not, and never was, a slut.” Realizing he’ll need way to listen to the rest of the tapes as he travels around town, Clay goes to his friend Tony’s house to get a Walkman. 
After leaving Tony’s, Clay listens to Cassette 1, Side B. On it, Hannah discusses Alex Standall. Hannah, Alex and a girl named Jessica Davis became friends and started spending time at Monet’s, a local coffee shop. After Jessica and Alex had an unpleasant breakup, Alex made a “Who’s Hot / Who’s Not” list and passed it around school. Trying to make Jessica angry, Alex listed Hannah as “Best Ass in the Freshman Class” and listed Jessica as the worst. Shortly afterwards, a student came up behind Hannah and spanked as she was standing in line at a store. With the promiscuity rumors already circulating, Hannah believes that Alex’s list gave the student an excuse for his behavior.
Clay sits on the curb outside the store where the incident occurred and plays the next tape, Cassette 2, Side A. Hannah describes her friendship with Jessica Davis. After the “Who’s Hot / Who’s Not” list started to circulate through school, Jessica confronted Hannah, stating that the promiscuity rumors must be true, and that Hannah had been involved with Alex. Hannah tried to explain that Alex put their names on his list just to make Jessica jealous, but Jessica became angry and struck Hannah, leaving a small scar above her eyebrow. Clay takes a city bus to Monet’s and orders a coffee.
At Monet’s, Clay listens to Cassette 2, Side B. Hannah talks about a yearbook photographer, Tyler Down, who secretly took pictures of her from outside her bedroom window. Hannah asked a fellow classmate, Courtney Crimsen, to help her catch this Peeping Tom in the act. In Hannah’s room, she and Courtney talk loudly and provocatively to entice the photographer, and then run to the window and see someone who Hannah later confirms is Tyler. Hannah has recorded this tape while standing outside Tyler’s window, and she marks his address on the map so others can invade his privacy, just like he invaded hers.
While taking another bus to get to Tyler’s house, Clay sees that a fellow student, Skye Miller, is also aboard. He had a crush on her in eighth grade, but Clay says that at some point Skye stopped talking to other students. Exiting the bus, Clay sees that Tyler’s window has been broken. On Cassette 3, Side A, Hannah talks about Courtney Crimsen, who everyone assumes is a good person. Hannah gives examples of how Courtney manipulates people and is quite fake. After giving Courtney a ride to a party, she even tried to start new rumors about Hannah.
On Cassette 3, Side B, Hannah describes going on a date with Marcus Cooley at Rosie’s, a local diner. While sitting in a booth, Marcus put his hand on Hannah’s thigh. After he refused to remove his hand, Hannah shoved him out of the booth. He loudly called her a “tease” and left. 
Clay thinks about how he and Hannah used to work at the local movie theater together. He had feelings for her but couldn’t bring himself to tell her because he was worried what people would think about him given Hannah’s reputation. 
Clay walks to Rosie’s Diner. On Cassette 4, Side A, Hannah tells how Zach Dempsey interfered with her life. In Mrs. Baker’s Peer Communications class, each student had a paper bag in which other students could leave anonymous compliments. After realizing that she was no longer receiving compliments, Hannah caught Zach stealing them. Hannah understood that Zach’s actions were childish, but says that this was a time in her life when she needed encouragement. Hannah then left a note in Mrs. Baker’s paper bag requesting a class discussion topic. On the note, Hannah said that she was contemplating suicide. Hannah was hurt when many students voiced annoyance over the topic and the anonymous student who’d suggested it.
Still at Rosie’s, Clay listens to Cassette 4, Side B. Hannah talks about Ryan Shaver, the editor of a school publication called the Lost-N-Found Gazette. She and Ryan met at a poetry group and got along. Ryan published one of Hannah’s poems in the Lost-N-Found Gazette without her permission. While he did not put her name on it, some students guessed who wrote it and made fun of her. Hannah felt as though her thoughts and feelings were offered up for ridicule.
When Clay leaves the diner, Tony is waiting and tells Clay to get in his car. Tony explains that he has the second set of tapes and that he’s been making sure that everyone on the list listens to them and passes them on. 
Clay listens to Cassette 5, Side A—the tape about him. Hannah talks about the time she and Clay connected at a party, eventually kissing in an unoccupied bedroom. But Hannah, exhausted from the stress of her life, freaked out and told Clay to leave, which he did.
Tony drives through different neighborhoods while Clay listens to Cassette 5, Side B. Hannah continues her story of the party, from the moment after Clay left. While hiding in a closet, she heard Bryce Walker sexually assault Jessica Davis, who was passed out on the nearby bed. The tape is actually dedicated to Justin Foley, though, because he left Jessica in the room and let Bryce in, knowing what Bryce would do.
Disgusted by what he’s heard, Clay leaves Tony’s car and starts walking. On Cassette 6, Side A, Hannah tells of leaving the party where the assault occurred with Jenny Kurtz. While driving Hannah home, Jenny ran over a stop sign. Hannah thought that they should tell the police, but Jenny didn’t want to get in trouble, so she drove off, leaving Hannah to walk home. Later that night, there was an accident at that intersection in which a student from Hannah and Clay’s school was killed. 
Clay listens to Cassette 6, Side B, in which Hannah tells a story about giving up on herself. Late at night, Hannah walked past a house where a party was winding down. Bryce Walker asked Hannah to join him in a hot tub. Hannah knew that it was a terrible idea but stripped down to her underwear and got in anyway. Bryce put his hands in Hannah’s underwear, despite Hannah turning away from him and crying. On the tape, she states that she never told him “no,” and that she was just using him to let go of life completely. 
On Cassette 7, Side A, Clay listens to a conversation that Hannah had recorded between herself and her school guidance counselor, Mr. Porter. She tells Mr. Porter that she is considering suicide, and he tries to help her, but the conversation only angers Hannah. When she leaves his office, he doesn’t pursue her. 
The next morning, Clay mails the tapes to Jenny Kurtz, who is next on the list. When he goes to school, he sees Skye Miller, the girl from the bus who stopped talking to other people. Clay runs after her and talks to her."
Other,"The Other Wes Moore: One Name, Two Fates tells the story of two Black men with the same name: Wes Moore. Both men grew up enduring similar hardships, but Moore, the author and narrator, was encouraged to overcome these difficulties and became successful, while Wes, his counterpart, found himself sentenced to life in prison for murder. Moore learns about Wes and, fascinated, writes him a letter, hoping to find out more about what led Wes to a life of incarceration. Moore receives a response from Wes and begins to visit him in prison, where the two share their stories.
In the first section of the book, the two men discuss the impact that the absence of their fathers had on their lives, and their stories alternate in each chapter. Moore introduces his mother, Joy; father, Westley; and sisters, Nikki and Shani. He details how his parents met and describes his father’s job as a radio journalist. When Moore was three years old, he watched his father become sick and die in front of him. 
Meanwhile, young Wes has never met his father, Bernard, who was an alcoholic, but loved spending time with his father’s mother, Mamie. One day, Wes’s mother, Mary, learns that her funding to go to college has been taken away, and her dream to get her degree crumbles. That night, Mary has plans with friends, so she drops young Wes off at Mamie’s for the night. When Wes arrives at Mamie’s, he sees a drunk man—Bernard—on Mamie’s couch. When Bernard asks Mary who the kid is, Mary introduces Wes to his father.
Several years later, Wes and his friend Woody go the park, where they meet up with a group of boys to play football. The game turns aggressive, and another boy punches Wes. Wes runs home and grabs a knife. He returns to the park and runs after the boy, but the police arrive and arrest Wes. He is eight years old. 
Around this time, Moore’s widowed mother, Joy, unable to raise her children alone any longer, has moved her family to the Bronx to live with her parents. To keep Moore off the street, she sends Moore to Riverdale, a private school. She works three jobs to pay the tuition. Moore feels alienated. He doesn’t fit in at Riverdale, and the neighborhood kids tease him for attending a white school. When Moore’s grades slip, Joy threatens to send him to military school.

At the same time, Moore learns how young Black men in South Africa are encouraged and celebrated, rather than feared, and decides to dedicate himself to a life of service."
Aid,"Nine years after the start of the Trojan War, the Greek (“Achaean”) army sacks Chryse, a town allied with Troy. During the battle, the Achaeans capture a pair of beautiful maidens, Chryseis and Briseis. Agamemnon, the leader of the Achaean forces, takes Chryseis as his prize, and Achilles, the Achaeans’ greatest warrior, claims Briseis. Chryseis’s father, Chryses, who serves as a priest of the god Apollo, offers an enormous ransom in return for his daughter, but Agamemnon refuses to give Chryseis back. Chryses then prays to Apollo, who sends a plague upon the Achaean camp.
After many Achaeans die, Agamemnon consults the prophet Calchas to determine the cause of the plague. When he learns that Chryseis is the cause, he reluctantly gives her up but then demands Briseis from Achilles as compensation. Furious at this insult, Achilles returns to his tent in the army camp and refuses to fight in the war any longer. He vengefully yearns to see the Achaeans destroyed and asks his mother, the sea-nymph Thetis, to enlist the services of Zeus, king of the gods, toward this end. The Trojan and Achaean sides have declared a cease-fire with each other, but now the Trojans breach the treaty and Zeus comes to their aid.
With Zeus supporting the Trojans and Achilles refusing to fight, the Achaeans suffer great losses. Several days of fierce conflict ensue, including duels between Paris and Menelaus and between Hector and Ajax. The Achaeans make no progress; even the heroism of the great Achaean warrior Diomedes proves fruitless. The Trojans push the Achaeans back, forcing them to take refuge behind the ramparts that protect their ships. The Achaeans begin to nurture some hope for the future when a nighttime reconnaissance mission by Diomedes and Odysseus yields information about the Trojans’ plans, but the next day brings disaster. Several Achaean commanders become wounded, and the Trojans break through the Achaean ramparts. They advance all the way up to the boundary of the Achaean camp and set fire to one of the ships. Defeat seems imminent, because without the ships, the army will be stranded at Troy and almost certainly destroyed.
Concerned for his comrades but still too proud to help them himself, Achilles agrees to a plan proposed by Nestor that will allow his beloved friend Patroclus to take his place in battle, wearing his armor. Patroclus is a fine warrior, and his presence on the battlefield helps the Achaeans push the Trojans away from the ships and back to the city walls. But the counterattack soon falters. Apollo knocks Patroclus’s armor to the ground, and Hector slays him. Fighting then breaks out as both sides try to lay claim to the body and armor. Hector ends up with the armor, but the Achaeans, thanks to a courageous effort by Menelaus and others, manage to bring the body back to their camp. When Achilles discovers that Hector has killed Patroclus, he fills with such grief and rage that he agrees to reconcile with Agamemnon and rejoin the battle. Thetis goes to Mount Olympus and persuades the god Hephaestus to forge Achilles a new suit of armor, which she presents to him the next morning. Achilles then rides out to battle at the head of the Achaean army.
Meanwhile, Hector, not expecting Achilles to rejoin the battle, has ordered his men to camp outside the walls of Troy. But when the Trojan army glimpses Achilles, it flees in terror back behind the city walls. Achilles cuts down every Trojan he sees. Strengthened by his rage, he even fights the god of the river Xanthus, who is angered that Achilles has caused so many corpses to fall into his streams. Finally, Achilles confronts Hector outside the walls of Troy. Ashamed at the poor advice that he gave his comrades, Hector refuses to flee inside the city with them. Achilles chases him around the city’s periphery three times, but the goddess Athena finally tricks Hector into turning around and fighting Achilles. In a dramatic duel, Achilles kills Hector. He then lashes the body to the back of his chariot and drags it across the battlefield to the Achaean camp. Upon Achilles’ arrival, the triumphant Achaeans celebrate Patroclus’s funeral with a long series of athletic games in his honor. Each day for the next nine days, Achilles drags Hector’s body in circles around Patroclus’s funeral bier.
At last, the gods agree that Hector deserves a proper burial. Zeus sends the god Hermes to escort King Priam, Hector’s father and the ruler of Troy, into the Achaean camp. Priam tearfully pleads with Achilles to take pity on a father bereft of his son and return Hector’s body. He invokes the memory of Achilles’ own father, Peleus. Deeply moved, Achilles finally relents and returns Hector’s corpse to the Trojans. Both sides agree to a temporary truce, and Hector receives a hero’s funeral."
Late,"Never Let Me Go takes place in a dystopian version of late 1990s England, where the lives of ordinary citizens are prolonged through a state-sanctioned program of human cloning. The clones, referred to as students, grow up in special institutions away from the outside world. As young adults, they begin to donate their vital organs. All “donors” receive care from designated “carers,” clones who have not yet begun the donation process. The clones continue to donate organs until they “complete,” which is a euphemism for death after the donation of three or four organs. However, this premise is not immediately apparent to the reader. At the start of the novel, narrator Kathy H. merely introduces herself as a thirty-one-year-old carer. She has been a carer for nearly twelve years, but will leave her role in a few months. Kathy explains that she wants to revisit her memories of Tommy and Ruth, two friends who grew up with her at the Hailsham school. Kathy does not explain the donation program, or mention that Hailsham students are clones.
Although Kathy’s narration is often nonlinear, the novel’s three parts roughly align with three stages in her life. In Part One, Kathy remembers her childhood at Hailsham. She describes her friendship with Ruth, whose temperamental personality contrasts with her own quiet demeanor. At Hailsham, Ruth often annoys Kathy by pretending to have special knowledge and privileges. Kathy also describes Tommy, a student known for throwing violent temper tantrums. Tommy is initially an outcast among his peers because he lacks artistic ability, which the Hailsham staff (part teacher, part parent figures known as “guardians”), and its students value highly. Kathy sympathizes with Tommy, and tries to calm him down during one of his tantrums. Tommy later learns to control his temper after a guardian named Miss Lucy assures him that it is not necessary for him to be creative.
Although the students learn vaguely about the donation program, their guardians shield them from a full understanding of their future. Miss Lucy disagrees with this indirect approach, and often exhibits strange behavior in front of the students as a result, in one instance telling them explicitly about their futures. After Miss Lucy speaks with Tommy about his artwork, he and Kathy theorize that creativity may be connected to donations. They speculate about Madame, a woman who visits Hailsham to collect the best student artwork. Madame is rumored to keep this art in a personal gallery. Kathy later encounters Madame in the girls’ dormitory, while Kathy dances to the song “Never Let Me Go.” The song is Kathy’s favorite track on Songs After Dark, a Judy Bridgewater album that is one of her most prized possessions. When the song ends, Kathy sees Madame crying in the doorway. Shortly afterwards, Kathy loses her tape. Tommy’s temper returns during their last summer at Hailsham. Kathy thinks he is upset about his recent breakup with Ruth, whom he has dated for six months. But Tommy is upset about Miss Lucy, who recently told him that she was wrong to dismiss the importance of creativity. Miss Lucy departs Hailsham abruptly, and Tommy mends his relationship with Ruth.
In Part Two, Kathy moves with Ruth and Tommy to a transitional housing facility known as the Cottages. They adjust to their new lives, becoming acquainted with the “veteran” students living there already. Ruth often ignores Tommy and Kathy in her efforts to blend in with the veterans, who are not from Hailsham. Kathy notices that the veterans regard the Hailsham students with awe. One couple, Chrissie and Rodney, are especially interested in Hailsham. They convince Ruth to go with them to Norfolk, where Rodney claims to have seen Ruth’s “possible” in an open-plan office (a “possible” is a human that resembles a specific clone and from whom that clone's DNA may have been copied). Kathy is skeptical of Rodney’s story, especially since it features Ruth’s “dream future” of working in an open-plan office. In the end, Kathy, Tommy, Ruth, Rodney, and Chrissie all drive to Norfolk.
In Norfolk, Chrissie and Rodney ask about a rumored exception allowing Hailsham couples in love to defer their donations. Ruth pretends to know something about deferrals, which surprises Kathy and Tommy. The students eventually find the open-plan office. Rodney points to a woman in the window, and they all agree that she could be Ruth’s legitimate possible. They follow her to an art gallery, where they realize that the woman does not actually resemble Ruth. In her disappointment, Ruth says that the students are modeled only on “trash.” Ruth goes off with Chrissie and Rodney. Meanwhile, Tommy and Kathy find a copy of Kathy’s lost tape in a secondhand store. Tommy tells Kathy that he has begun drawing pictures of imaginary animals. He thinks Madame uses the students’ artwork to determine if couples applying for deferrals are truly in love. After Norfolk, Ruth stops talking about her dream future. Tommy shows his drawings to Kathy, who finds them puzzling but captivating. Meanwhile, Kathy’s friendship with Ruth grows increasingly tense. Ruth reveals that she knows Kathy likes Tommy, but says that Tommy will never return Kathy’s feelings. Shortly afterwards, Kathy submits her application for carer training and departs.
Part Three focuses on Kathy’s time as carer. While Kathy is good at her job, the work is both difficult and lonely. She unexpectedly runs into a Hailsham friend named Laura, who is also a carer. They talk about Ruth, who had a bad first donation. They also talk about Hailsham, which has closed. Kathy becomes Ruth’s carer, but their relationship is strained and guarded. One day, Ruth expresses a desire to visit a beached fishing boat near Tommy’s recovery center. They pick up Tommy on the way to the boat, which they find bleached and crumbling in a marsh. The marsh reminds both Tommy and Ruth of Hailsham. They also discuss Chrissie, who completed on her second donation. On the return trip, Ruth apologizes for keeping Tommy and Kathy apart. She encourages them to pursue a deferral, revealing that she has discovered Madame’s home address. In the weeks that follow, Kathy and Ruth reminisce peacefully about Hailsham and the Cottages. Ruth also encourages Kathy to become Tommy’s carer.
Ruth completes after her second donation. Tommy gives his third donation, and Kathy becomes his carer. They spend their days reading and talking at his recovery center. Eventually, they also begin to have sex. Hoping to pursue a deferral, they go to visit Madame at the address Ruth provided. Madame invites them inside and listens to their request, after which Miss Emily appears from the next room. Miss Emily says that deferrals do not exist. She explains that Hailsham was part of a progressive movement committed to raising clones more humanely. Madame used to exhibit the students’ artwork to show the outside world that clones had souls. Although the movement once had many supporters, changing public opinion eventually forced Hailsham to close. On the drive back to his recovery center, Tommy asks Kathy to pull over. He walks into the woods and begins screaming. Kathy goes to Tommy and holds him. Soon after, Tommy gives his fourth donation and completes. Kathy drives to a field in Norfolk, where she allows herself to imagine Tommy on the horizon. Then she drives away."
Tree,"The Bean Trees opens in rural Kentucky. The novel’s protagonist, Taylor Greer, who is known at the beginning of the novel by her given name, Marietta, or by her nickname, Missy, remembers a moment in her childhood when Newt Hardbine’s father was thrown to the top of the Chevron sign after his tractor tire exploded. Ever since then, Taylor has been afraid of tires. Taylor goes on to tell the story of Newt Hardbine, a peer of Taylor’s who died while Taylor was still in high school. Although Newt and Taylor seemed like identical kids when they were small, Taylor was the one to escape small-town life. She did so by avoiding pregnancy, getting a job working at the hospital, and saving up enough money to buy herself an old Volkswagon bug. About five years after high school graduation, Taylor says goodbye to her beloved mother, Alice Greer, and leaves Pittman County, Kentucky, for good.
The protagonist decides that she will drive until her car runs out of gas and then take a new name based on wherever she is when her car stops. She ends up in Taylorville, and changes her name from Marietta to Taylor. Her car breaks down in the middle of the Cherokee Nation in Oklahoma, and she stops in an old bar for a cup of coffee and a hamburger. As she sits in her car, getting ready to leave, a woman approaches and puts a baby in the front seat of Taylor’s car, telling her to take it. She tells Taylor she is the sister of the child’s mother and that the baby was born in a Plymouth car. The woman leaves with no further explanation. Taylor is bewildered, but drives off with the child. They go to a hotel, and while bathing the baby, Taylor discovers that the baby, a girl, has been abused and sexually molested. She names the baby Turtle because the girl clings to things like a mud turtle.
Eventually, Taylor and Turtle make it to Tucson, Arizona. When Taylor’s two back tires blow out, Taylor goes to an auto-repair shop called Jesus Is Lord Used Tires. There she meets the owner, a kind, wise woman named Mattie. Mattie takes to Turtle right away. Taylor moves into a Tucson hotel with Turtle and finds a job working at the Burger Derby.
The narrative switches to the story of Lou Ann Ruiz, another Kentuckian living in Tucson. Lou Ann has been abandoned by her husband, Angel. On January 1, she gives birth to a son, Dwayne Ray. Lou Ann’s mother and Granny Logan come west to visit the baby, and Granny Logan brings water from the Tug Fork River in Kentucky, which she suggests should be used to baptize the baby. When Angel comes home to gather up some of his things, he pours the water down the drain.
Meanwhile, Taylor has started her new job, but she quits six days later. She begins to look for a place to live, and finds a room for rent listed in the paper. The room turns out to belong to Lou Ann. The two women become fast friends, and Taylor takes the room. Without work, Taylor is left with no option but to take a job working for Mattie at Jesus Is Lord Used Tires. One day Taylor meets two of Mattie’s friends, Estevan and Esperanza, a married couple from Guatemala. Soon, it is evident that they are illegal aliens living with other illegal aliens in Mattie’s home above the tire shop.
A month or so later, Taylor takes Turtle to see a doctor and finds that Turtle’s growth has been stunted because she was abused. Turtle is not a baby, as her size indicates, but a three-year-old. That same day, Angel tells Lou Ann that he is leaving her for good.
Mattie’s friend Esperanza attempts suicide. When Estevan comes to tell Taylor this news, he ends up divulging the story of their past. He tells her that he and Esperanza had to leave behind a child in Guatemala. The government wanted the names of union members from Estevan and Esperanza and took their daughter, Ismene, as a way of forcing them to tell. Choosing to save seventeen lives instead of trying to get their daughter back, the couple fled their country. Estevan spends the night on Taylor’s couch. Taylor realizes she is falling in love with him.
After a few weeks, Lou Ann gets a job at a salsa factory, supporting herself in the absence of her husband. No sooner does she start her new job than Angel sends a package with presents for Lou Ann and Dwayne Ray, and a letter asking her to come live with him in Montana, or, if she does not want to do that, to let him come back and live with her in Tucson. After consideration, Lou Ann refuses to take him back.
On the night of the first summer rain, Mattie takes Esperanza, Estevan, and Taylor into the desert to see the natural world come to life. Turtle is left with her baby-sitter, a blind woman named Edna Poppy. Edna and Turtle go to the park, and because of her disability, Edna does not notice when a prowler approaches Turtle. Taylor returns and hears as much of the story as Edna can tell: Edna heard struggling and swung in the direction of the attacker with her cane. She hit him and then felt Turtle tugging on the hem of her skirt. Turtle does not seem hurt, but she has stopped speaking and has the same vacuous look in her eyes that she had when Taylor first saw her. Turtle’s trauma and the difficulties of Estevan and Esperanza make Taylor depressed. To make matters worse, the police investigation into the attack on Turtle reveals that Taylor has no legal claim on Turtle. Taylor will be forced to give her to a state ward or find a way around the law. The social worker in Tucson gives Taylor the name of a legal advisor in Oklahoma, where the laws are different.
Mattie becomes worried about Estevan and Esperanza’s safety. A recent crackdown on illegal immigration will force them to find a new home and a way of getting there. Taylor decides she will transport Estevan and Esperanza to another sanctuary for illegal immigrants in Oklahoma. While there, she will look for Turtle’s relatives and see if they will consent to a legal adoption. Once in Oklahoma, Taylor returns to the bar where she received Turtle but finds that it has changed owners. There are no signs of the people she met there seven months before. Taylor, Esperanza, and Estevan decide to go to the Lake o’ the Cherokees. During that time, Taylor concocts a plan to convince the authorities in Oklahoma that Estevan and Esperanza are Turtle’s biological parents.
Once in the office of Mr. Armistead, the legal authority in Oklahoma, Esperanza and Estevan pretend to be Turtle’s biological parents. Esperanza sobs real tears at the prospect of giving up Turtle, and Taylor realizes that Esperanza is grieving the loss of her own daughter, who looked so much like Turtle. Taylor and Turtle drop off Esperanza and Estevan at their new home, a church in Oklahoma. Taylor says a tearful goodbye to Estevan. Taylor then calls her mother, who comforts her. Taylor and Turtle head back to Tucson, a place that both of them now call home."
Annexed,"Anne’s diary begins on her thirteenth birthday, June 12, 1942, and ends shortly after her fifteenth. At the start of her diary, Anne describes fairly typical girlhood experiences, writing about her friendships with other girls, her crushes on boys, and her academic performance at school. Because anti-Semitic laws forced Jews into separate schools, Anne and her older sister, Margot, attended the Jewish Lyceum in Amsterdam.
	The Franks had moved to the Netherlands in the years leading up to World War II to escape persecution in Germany. After the Germans invaded the Netherlands in 1940, the Franks were forced into hiding. With another family, the van Daans, and an acquaintance, Mr. Dussel, they moved into a small secret annex above Otto Frank’s office where they had stockpiled food and supplies. The employees from Otto’s firm helped hide the Franks and kept them supplied with food, medicine, and information about the outside world.
	The residents of the annex pay close attention to every development of the war by listening to the radio. Some bits of news catch Anne’s attention and make their way into her diary, providing a vivid historical context for her personal thoughts. The adults make optimistic bets about when the war will end, and their mood is severely affected by Allied setbacks or German advances. Amsterdam is devastated by the war during the two years the Franks are in hiding. All of the city’s residents suffer, since food becomes scarce and robberies more frequent.
	Anne often writes about her feelings of isolation and loneliness. She has a tumultuous relationship with the adults in the annex, particularly her mother, whom she considers lacking in love and affection. She adores her father, but she is frequently scolded and criticized by Mr. and Mrs. van Daan and Mr. Dussel. Anne thinks that her sister, Margot, is smart, pretty, and agreeable, but she does not feel close to her and does not write much about her. Anne eventually develops a close friendship with Peter van Daan, the teenage boy in the annex. Mr. Frank does not approve, however, and the intensity of Anne’s infatuation begins to lessen.
	Anne matures considerably throughout the course of her diary entries, moving from detailed accounts of basic activities to deeper, more profound thoughts about humanity and her own personal nature. She finds it difficult to understand why the Jews are being singled out and persecuted. Anne also confronts her own identity. Though she considers herself to be German, her German citizenship has been revoked, and though she calls Holland her home, many of the Dutch have turned against the Jews. Anne feels a tremendous solidarity with her aggrieved people, and yet at the same time she wants to be seen as an individual rather than a member of a persecuted group.
During the two years recorded in her diary, Anne deals with confinement and deprivation, as well as the complicated and difficult issues of growing up in the brutal circumstances of the Holocaust. Her diary describes a struggle to define herself within this climate of oppression. Anne’s diary ends without comment on August 1, 1944, the end of a seemingly normal day that leaves us with the expectation of seeing another entry on the next page. However, the Frank family is betrayed to the Nazis and arrested on August 4, 1944. Anne’s diary, the observations of an imaginative, friendly, sometimes petty, and rather normal teenage girl, comes to an abrupt and silent end. 
Otto Frank is the family’s sole survivor, and he recovers Anne’s diary from Miep. He decides to fulfill Anne’s wishes by publishing the diary. Anne’s diary becomes a condemnation of the unimaginable horror of the Holocaust, and one of the few accounts that describe it from a young person’s perspective.
	Since Anne’s diary is a true personal account of a life in hiding, it is inappropriate to analyze it as a novel or other work of fiction. Parts of the diary were intended for public view, but others clearly were not. To appreciate and interpret the diary, it is necessary to consider its horrible context, World War II and the Holocaust, before any discussion of plot development or thematic content."
Intrigue,"Northanger Abbey is the coming-of-age story of a young woman named Catherine Morland. It is divided into two sections, Book I and Book II. The two Books differ significantly from each other in setting and, to a degree, in tone.
Book I begins when the Allens, family friends of the Morlands, offer to take Catherine with them to Bath, a resort for the wealthier members of British society. The 17-year-old Catherine eagerly accepts the Allens' invitation. Catherine is young and naïve. Her life has been relatively sheltered, so Bath is a new world for her. In Bath, Catherine is introduced to Henry Tilney, a young clergyman who impresses Catherine with his wit and pleasant conversation. Catherine quickly falls for Henry, but after their first meeting she does not see him again for some time. Mrs. Allen runs into an old acquaintance, Mrs. Thorpe, and her three young daughters, including Isabella, who is slightly older than Catherine. Catherine and Isabella are soon best friends. Isabella, superficial and fond of gossip, inducts Catherine into the social world of Bath, with all its balls, dances, shows, fashion, and its gossip.
Just when Catherine and Isabella have settled into a close friendship, they are met with the arrival of James Morland, Catherine's brother, and John Thorpe, Isabella's brother. James and John are friends at Oxford University. Isabella wastes no time in flirting with James, and soon it is obvious to everyone except Catherine that James and Isabella are in love. Taking a cue from James, John tries to woo Catherine, asking her to be his dance partner. But at a ball, Catherine sees Henry Tilney again and is more interested in Henry than in John. John's bragging and his arrogant nature put off Catherine.
Soon all of Isabella's time is taken up with James. Without Isabella to spend her time with and saddled with the unpleasant John Thorpe, Catherine decides to become friends with Eleanor Tilney, Henry's sister. Eleanor quickly sees that Catherine has feelings for Henry, but does not say anything. After rain seems to wash out her plans for a walk with Henry and Eleanor, Catherine is pressured by James and Isabella into riding with John, much to her dismay. On the way, she spots Henry and Eleanor walking toward her house for the planned walk. John refuses to stop, angering Catherine.
Catherine apologizes to Eleanor and Henry, and plans are made for another walk. John, Isabella, and James again intervene, pressuring Catherine into another outing. Catherine firmly refuses this time and joins Eleanor and Henry in a walk around Beechen Cliff. They discuss novels, and Catherine is delighted to find that Henry and Eleanor love books as much as she does. Catherine returns home to discover that James and Isabella have become engaged. She briefly meets with John, who is leaving Bath for several weeks. John leaves with the false impression that Catherine is in love with him, although Catherine does not realize this.
Book II begins with the arrival of Henry's older brother, Captain Frederick Tilney. Isabella quickly catches the eye of the captain and, dismayed by the discovery of James's modest income, begins to flirt with Frederick. Eleanor invites Catherine to visit the Tilney home in Northanger Abbey. The invitation is seconded by Eleanor's father, General Tilney. Catherine eagerly accepts the invitation, delighted at the prospect of visiting a real abbey and at seeing more of Henry. Before Catherine leaves, Isabella tells her that John is planning to propose to Catherine. Catherine tells Isabella to write him and tell him, with her apologies, that he is mistaken. Frederick appears and flirts with Isabella, who returns his attentions. Dismayed by this behavior, Catherine asks Henry to convince Frederick to leave Isabella alone. Henry refuses, knowing that Isabella is at least as guilty as the captain, but he tells Catherine that Frederick will probably leave Bath with his regiment soon anyway.
Catherine leaves with the Tilneys for Northanger Abbey. On the way, Catherine tells Henry how she imagines the Abbey to resemble the haunted ruins of the Gothic novels she loves. Henry, amused, responds by giving a hypothetical account of her first night at the Abbey, complete with mysterious chests, violent storms, and secret passages. Northanger Abbey turns out to be quite dull, having been fixed up by General Tilney. Due to her overactive imagination, Catherine entertains all sorts of frightening ideas about the place, each of which is thwarted. For instance, a strange bureau in Catherine's room turns out to contain nothing more mysterious than receipts. Catherine becomes intrigued by the death of Eleanor and Henry's mother years earlier. Her mind full of Gothic plots, Catherine suspects that General Tilney of murdering his wife. Catherine sneaks into the mother's old chamber and discovers nothing. She is caught by Henry, who guesses her thoughts and scolds her. Mortified and ashamed, Catherine quickly resumes her good behavior.
Catherine receives a letter from her brother telling her that his engagement to Isabella has been called off. Catherine thinks that Frederick forced himself between them, but Henry convinces her that it was as much Isabella's fault as Frederick's. Catherine visits Henry's house at Woodston. The General drops hints about Catherine marrying Henry. Catherine gets another letter, this time from Isabella, telling her that Frederick has left her, and asking Catherine to apologize to James for her. Angry at being manipulated, Catherine wishes she had never known Isabella. The General leaves on a business trip, and Henry goes back to Woodston for several days. The General then returns unexpectedly and tells Eleanor to send Catherine away the next morning. Though she is very embarrassed, Eleanor has no choice but to send Catherine to her home in Fullerton.
Catherine's family is irritated by the General's rudeness, but is glad to have her home. Catherine mopes around, despondent, until suddenly Henry arrives in Fullerton and proposes to her. Henry explains that his father's behavior was due to John Thorpe. In Bath, when John thought Catherine loved him, he had told General Tilney that Catherine was from a very wealthy family. When the General ran into John much later, after Isabella had told John about Catherine's true feelings, John had angrily told the General that the Morlands were almost poor. Mortified, the General had sent Catherine away, furious that his hopes for John to make a wealthy match were to be frustrated. Henry and Catherine decide to wait until the General gives his consent to their marriage. Within a few months, Eleanor marries a very wealthy and important man, which puts the General in a good mood. Once he is told of the true nature of the Morland's financial situation, which is moderate, he gives his consent, and the novel ends with the marriage of Henry and Catherine."
Circle,"Mae Holland is a young woman a few years out of college who has just landed a job at the Circle, a major tech company voted “most innovative” four years in a row. The company has swallowed up its competitors with the invention of TruYou, a system that funnels a user’s accounts and online activity into one personal, traceable account. The Circle’s founder, Ty Gospodinov, invented the system and joined with two others, Eamon Bailey and Tom Stenton, to establish the company, which now wields an inordinate amount of power across the world.
Mae’s friend Annie Allerton got Mae the job at the Circle. Mae and Annie became close friends in college when Annie took care of Mae after she broke her jaw. While Mae is more reserved and self-conscious, Annie is vibrant, cheerful, and friendly. Annie’s quickly risen in the ranks of the Circle to become one of the Gang of 40, the top inner sanctum of the Circle. During Mae’s first days on the job, she’s quickly submersed in a fast-moving, hyper-connected world, a far cry from her job at the utility company she had back home. Mae struggles to keep up with the Circle’s mission of “Passion, Participation, and Transparency,” making a few faux pas on the job, such as not responding to a co-worker’s invite to brunch and not attending enough parties on the Circle’s campus, the series of offices, dorms, eateries, and shops that make up the Circle’s compound.
Back home, Mae learns that her father has multiple sclerosis, and her ex-boyfriend, Mercer, still visits them to offer help. The fact that Mae can’t help her parents, who are drowning trying to navigate health care red tape, makes her feel powerless. Mercer, who is staunchly against the invasive reach of technology, is also a thorn in Mae’s side. Whenever she’s home, he volleys her with attacks on her job, trying to make her question the Circle’s agenda. For Mae, her job is a golden opportunity and made her into an adult. She’s now an influencer whose tastes, opinions, and clothing can shape the market, and beyond that, she’s her parents’ savior when she’s able to put them on her company's health insurance plan and save them from their health woes. Mae, although annoyed and resentful, is resistant to Mercer’s attacks.
The Circle’s agenda grows towards something called Completion, something people hear being discussed on the Circle’s campus, but don’t know much about. Mae begins a relationship with two men on the campus: Francis, a man with a tragic past who is developing a child tracking software that puts chips in children’s bones, and Kalden, a mysterious man who doesn’t come up in any of the Circle’s directories and whom Annie suspects is a spy. Mae doesn’t feel satisfied with Francis, but he’s available. Kalden, on the other hand, is not available, as he only appears in Mae’s life sporadically.
Mae often goes kayaking to relieve her stress. One night, she’s caught “stealing” a kayak by two of the Circle’s SeeChange cameras, which are tiny, popsicle-sized surveillance cameras being posted across the world and promoted by the Circle. The next day at work, Mae is called into Bailey’s office and convinced she should go transparent and wear a camera 24/7 as a show of good faith. Mae complies. The Circle also convinces dozens of Congress members to go to raise the public’s faith in its leaders.
After going transparent, Mae’s popularity and visibility soar, which makes Annie jealous. Annie, who is participating in the Circle’s PastPerfect program, which traces one’s ancestry online, grows wearier of the Circle’s ever-invasive policies and programs after she discovers unsettling information about her family’s past. Mae is emboldened by her newfound power, however, which increases even more after she helps create Demoxie, a system to track public voting through Circle accounts, during a company meeting. Mercer, who has warned Mae of the Circle’s totalitarian grip, writes Mae a letter denouncing the Circle’s programs, telling her he’s going off-grid. During a demonstration of a new technology called SoulSearch that crowdsources live tracking of criminals, Mae decides to use the software on Mercer, to try to win him over to the power of tech. When Mercer releases he’s being chased by drones, he drives off a cliff and ends his life, while thousands of people watch online.
Annie suffers a nervous breakdown after Mae, who has been completely indoctrinated into the so-called benevolence and power of the Circle’s transparency agenda, enlists the public’s help in a show of sympathy for Annie and her misgivings over her family’s past.  In Book III, the last section of the novel, Mae sits beside Annie’s hospital bed. Earlier, Kalden revealed himself to be Ty, the founder of the company, and had asked for Mae’s help to stop the Circle from reaching Completion, but he has failed. The novel ends with Mae sitting contently beside a broken Annie, thinking about how Mae narrowly averted the downfall of the Circle by telling Bailey and Stenton about Ty’s plans."
Debts,"The Tragedy of Pudd'nhead Wilson juggles three plot lines, which all come together in a murder trial at the novel's end. Pudd'nhead Wilson is a Northerner who comes to the small Missouri town of Dawson's Landing to build a career as a lawyer. Immediately upon his arrival he alienates the townspeople, who don't understand his wit. They give him the nickname ""Pudd'nhead"" and refuse to give him their legal work. He scrapes by on odd work and spends most of his time dabbling in scientific hobbies, most notably, fingerprinting.
Roxana, or Roxy, is a beautiful slave who can pass for white, though she is one-sixteenth Black. To save her infant son from ever being sold away from her, she switches him with the child of her white master, who looks just like her son and was born on the same day. Her son Chambers, now called ""Tom,"" grows up as a white man and heir to an estate. Her master's child, Tom, now called ""Chambers"", grows up a slave. ""Tom"" grows into a cruel, cowardly man. His gambling debts lead him, under Roxy's guidance, to rob houses, sell the now-freed Roxy as a slave, and finally to murder his uncle, Judge Driscoll, in a botched robbery attempt.
Luigi and Angelo are former sideshow performers. Good-looking and charming, they claim to be Italian twins, heirs of a deposed nobleman. They arrive in Dawson's Landing to rent a room in Widow Cooper's house, claiming they are tired of the bustle of the world. Luigi confesses to Pudd'nhead Wilson, who has read his palm, that he once killed a man who tried to steal a fabulous Indian knife from the brothers. This knife is stolen by ""Tom"" and used to kill Judge Driscoll. Luigi gets into an argument with ""Tom,"" who has him arrested. The judge is mortified that ""Tom"" has compromised the family honor by doing that, and he instead challenges Luigi to a duel. No one is killed, but ""Tom,"" to save his own reputation, tells his uncle that Luigi is a confessed assassin and therefore not an honorable man to duel. The twins, initially popular in the town, lose their reputation through the judge's claims against them, and lose in an election for city offices in which Pudd'nhead Wilson is elected mayor. Shortly after the election, ""Tom,"" badly in debt and needing money to pay off the man to whom he has fraudulently sold Roxy, murders the judge with the twins' knife while he is robbing him.
""Tom"" escapes disguised as a woman after killing his uncle. The twins, out for a walk, hear the judge's cries and rush to help. They are found standing over the body and their bloody knife is on the floor. They are brought to trial for the murder. Pudd'nhead Wilson, who is their attorney, through his fingerprint collection and a few lucky accidents, discovers that ""Tom"" is the murderer and that he is not the real Tom but Chambers. The twins are redeemed and freed, but soon leave for Europe. ""Tom"" is thrown in jail and then, since it is now known he is a slave, sold ""down the river"" to pay debts from the estate of the real Tom's father. ""Chambers,"" revealed to be Tom, is given back his place as a white man and heir, but, raised as a Black man and marked by his Black speech patterns, he now fits into society nowhere. Pudd'nhead is mayor of Dawson's Landing and finally a success as a lawyer, but none of his old friends are around anymore to enjoy his success with him."
Sufferings,"Werther is a young, educated, middle-class gentleman setting out to earn a living and make his mark on the world. His family expects him to get a job, and his friend, Wilhelm, networks with his contacts to find opportunities in government service. Werther nurtures a desire to be an artist, a pastime that doesn't pay the bills but suits his keen powers of observation and imagination. Werther leaves home in the spring of 1771 and writes letters to Wilhelm over a twenty-month period as he travels.
As Werther intersects with the world, he paints a picture of the monotony of daily existence relieved by the lofty beauty of the natural world. In nature’s vistas, he finds relief from his own introspective, melancholy thoughts. At an estate his family manages, Werther befriends the local townspeople and feels especially drawn to children. The people there lead simple lives, however, and he misses the intellectual stimulation he enjoys from the educated classes. 
After Werther relocates to Walheim, he meets Charlotte, the beautiful daughter of a local district judge. Charlotte’s mother has recently died, leaving behind nine children. On her deathbed, the mother entrusted the children to Charlotte’s care and gave her blessing to Charlotte’s engagement to Albert, a successful businessman. Albert is traveling on business when Werther and Charlotte dance the night away at a ball. Werther finds a kindred spirit in Charlotte and falls madly in love with her. He visits daily and develops a close relationship with Charlotte’s siblings, who enjoy his roughhousing and storytelling. Charlotte doesn’t reconsider her commitment to marrying Albert, and Werther respects the boundaries of their friendship. However, due to Werther’s frustrated longing for a closer relationship and a recognition that he has no future with her, his infatuation with Charlotte slowly becomes an obsession. When Werther begins having suicidal thoughts, he realizes he must break from the vicious cycle.
In the fall, Werther relocates from the country to the court when he takes a position as an attaché to an ambassador. Werther invests himself in his work, but he finds himself at odds with court culture. The emphasis on class rank among the people who surround the count disgusts Werther, who judges the worth of people, whether peasant or noble, based on their accomplishments. Soon, Werther’s promising start in government service begins to unravel. His dismissive criticism of petty social climbing blows back on him. When Werther fails to observe strict class protocols at the count’s home, the resulting ostracism among his friends and associates causes him to resign his commission. A nobleman sponsors Werther with a stipend to stay awhile with him while he considers his future. He counsels Werther against joining the army, and Werther abandons that career path and passes his time improving his drawing skills.
Werther’s melancholic thoughts turn once again to Charlotte, whom he still loves despite the news he received in February of 1772 that Charlotte and Albert married. He returns to Walheim hoping to recapture some of the optimism and energy he felt there. Instead, life’s difficulties press in on him. A child whom he once drew and cared about has died. The beautiful old walnut trees in the square have been cut down. Werther often visits Charlotte, but their platonic relationship drives him increasingly into a suicidal depression. 
Werther’s behavior becomes increasingly unstable. When he mounts a manic defense of a confessed murderer, Albert wants no more to do with him. Albert’s request that Charlotte terminate all contact with Werther forces her to confront her complex feelings for Werther. On December 20, she tells Werther that he may only visit when invited, trying to set boundaries that would allow the friendship she values so much to continue while still showing solidarity with Albert. She invites Werther to join their family’s Christmas Eve celebration, and she assumes he will abide by her wishes. Charlotte tells Albert she has the situation under control, and he leaves on an overnight business trip the next morning.
Werther, however, has already planned to take his life, and he disregards Charlotte’s instructions, arriving unannounced the next evening during Albert’s absence. Charlotte hastily tries to summon friends to join them, but in the meantime, she suggests that he read to her from his translation of Ossian, an epic poem that describes a hero’s death. Charlotte understands that Werther intends to end his life. The tragic events depicted in the poetry create an emotionally charged picture of their doomed love affair, and they exchange a passionate kiss for the first time. Overcome with grief for Werther and horror at her betrayal of Albert, Charlotte locks herself in an adjoining room until Werther leaves.
Werther’s joy at realizing Charlotte does love him only confirms his plan to end his life rather than live without her. He embraces death as a sacrifice for their marriage. Werther calmly wraps up his affairs and writes letters to Wilhelm and Charlotte, and the next day he shoots himself with a pistol he borrowed from Albert. He survives the head wound for twelve hours before succumbing to the brain injury from the bullet entering his skull. Local field hands inter his body in a grave that Werther had specified, unattended by any mourners or clergy."
Unfortunate,"A mean-spirited, miserly old man named Ebenezer Scrooge sits in his counting-house on a frigid Christmas Eve. His clerk, Bob Cratchit, shivers in the anteroom because Scrooge refuses to spend money on heating coals for a fire. Scrooge's nephew, Fred, pays his uncle a visit and invites him to his annual Christmas party. Two portly gentlemen also drop by and ask Scrooge for a contribution to their charity. Scrooge reacts to the holiday visitors with bitterness and venom, spitting out an angry ""Bah! Humbug!"" in response to his nephew's ""Merry Christmas!""
Later that evening, after returning to his dark, cold apartment, Scrooge receives a chilling visitation from the ghost of his dead partner, Jacob Marley. Marley, looking haggard and pallid, relates his unfortunate story. As punishment for his greedy and self-serving life his spirit has been condemned to wander the Earth weighted down with heavy chains. Marley hopes to save Scrooge from sharing the same fate. Marley informs Scrooge that three spirits will visit him during each of the next three nights. After the wraith disappears, Scrooge collapses into a deep sleep.
He wakes moments before the arrival of the Ghost of Christmas Past, a strange childlike phantom with a brightly glowing head. The spirit escorts Scrooge on a journey into the past to previous Christmases from the curmudgeon's earlier years. Invisible to those he watches, Scrooge revisits his childhood school days, his apprenticeship with a jolly merchant named Fezziwig, and his engagement to Belle, a woman who leaves Scrooge because his lust for money eclipses his ability to love another. Scrooge, deeply moved, sheds tears of regret before the phantom returns him to his bed.
The Ghost of Christmas Present, a majestic giant clad in a green fur robe, takes Scrooge through London to unveil Christmas as it will happen that year. Scrooge watches the large, bustling Cratchit family prepare a miniature feast in its meager home. He discovers Bob Cratchit's crippled son, Tiny Tim, a courageous boy whose kindness and humility warms Scrooge's heart. The specter then zips Scrooge to his nephew's to witness the Christmas party. Scrooge finds the jovial gathering delightful and pleads with the spirit to stay until the very end of the festivities. As the day passes, the spirit ages, becoming noticeably older. Toward the end of the day, he shows Scrooge two starved children, Ignorance and Want, living under his coat. He vanishes instantly as Scrooge notices a dark, hooded figure coming toward him.
The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come leads Scrooge through a sequence of mysterious scenes relating to an unnamed man's recent death. Scrooge sees businessmen discussing the dead man's riches, some vagabonds trading his personal effects for cash, and a poor couple expressing relief at the death of their unforgiving creditor. Scrooge, anxious to learn the lesson of his latest visitor, begs to know the name of the dead man. After pleading with the ghost, Scrooge finds himself in a churchyard, the spirit pointing to a grave. Scrooge looks at the headstone and is shocked to read his own name. He desperately implores the spirit to alter his fate, promising to renounce his insensitive, avaricious ways and to honor Christmas with all his heart. Whoosh! He suddenly finds himself safely tucked in his bed.
Overwhelmed with joy by the chance to redeem himself and grateful that he has been returned to Christmas Day, Scrooge rushes out onto the street hoping to share his newfound Christmas spirit. He sends a giant Christmas turkey to the Cratchit house and attends Fred's party, to the stifled surprise of the other guests. As the years go by, he holds true to his promise and honors Christmas with all his heart: he treats Tiny Tim as if he were his own child, provides lavish gifts for the poor, and treats his fellow human beings with kindness, generosity, and warmth."
Limb,"Mary Maloney is a homemaker sitting alone and working on her sewing in her quiet, orderly house as she waits for her husband Patrick, a police detective, to come home from work. Mary is six months pregnant. It is Thursday evening, the night of the couple typically goes out to eat, and Mary has the set-up for pre-dinner cocktails already prepared.
When her husband arrives, Mary greets him warmly. But her repeated offers of affectionate attention are all rebuked by clipped and dispassionate responses from Patrick. She prepares a weak cocktail for herself and a stronger one for Patrick who, uncharacteristically, downs the drink quickly, then pours and consumes a more potent second drink. Quietly alarmed, Mary suggests that Patrick eat some crackers and cheese, which he refuses. Mary then offers to forego their date night and prepare a home-cooked supper, suggesting, perhaps, some lamb chops or pork from the freezer downstairs. Patrick ignores the offer and orders Mary to sit down; he has something to tell her. At this point, her alarm turns to fear.
Patrick attempts to prepare Mary for some shocking news, claiming he has thought about it a lot and that he thinks it best to simply blurt it all out. Though his confession is not specified in the narrative, it becomes clear that Patrick intends to leave Mary. Patrick admits he knows his confession comes at a bad time, presumably, though he doesn’t say so directly, because Mary is pregnant. He tells her he will continue to provide her with financial support, and that he hopes everything will be handled discreetly because otherwise it would be bad for his job.
At first, Mary is stunned and uncertain. She decides that if she behaves as if nothing has happened, she can perhaps undo the damage. Without any direct verbal response to what he has said, she tells Patrick that she is going downstairs to get the meat for dinner, and he does not deter her. Hollowed and stupefied, Mary descends the steps to the cellar, retrieves a leg of lamb from the freezer, and carries it upstairs to prepare a meal. She sees Patrick standing near the window with his back to her. Without turning around, Patrick tells Mary that it is ludicrous to make dinner for him because he is going out.
Upon hearing these words, Mary walks up behind Patrick and brings the frozen leg of lamb down on his head in one unmitigated blow. His body undulates as if in slow motion, then drops dead to the floor, overturning a small table.
In the minutes after the killing, Mary gradually returns to full lucidity. She contemplates with neither concern nor regret, only resignation, that she may be executed for what she has done. It occurs to her to wonder what may happen to the unborn child of a pregnant murderer, and she immediately resolves to be proactive about her situation. She carries the meat into the kitchen, turns on the oven, and places the leg of lamb inside. Mary then practices her smile and tone of voice. It becomes clear that she is rehearsing to purchase potatoes and peas from a grocer named Sam.
Mary hurries out onto the street and goes to the grocery store where she addresses Sam, using the exact dialogue she rehearsed earlier. Sam is clearly familiar with Mr. and Mrs. Maloney, so Mary refers to her husband by his first name and tells Sam that Patrick has decided he is too tired to go out to eat tonight. Sam is attentive, and the two confirm that Mary has already started cooking a frozen leg of lamb.
As she returns home, Mary mentally prepares herself for the cover-up she must create in order to deflect suspicion and make Patrick’s death appear to be the result of an encounter with an unknown murderer. She goes so far as to call out to Patrick as if he could answer her, and the “discovery” of his body causes Mary to experience real, cathartic emotion that plays naturally into her overall charade.
Mary then proceeds to phone the police station where Patrick works, reporting in a heightened state of urgency that she thinks her husband is dead. The police officers who quickly arrive at her house are Sergeant Jack Noonan, whom Mary knows well, and another named O’Malley. Noonan is kind and chivalrous to Mary, as are all the investigators who show up including a doctor, two detectives, a police photographer, a fingerprint expert, and a few others. They sweep through and around the house, asking Mary questions and inspecting the crime scene. Two attendants arrive and remove the corpse. As the minutes pass, Mary picks up on every subtlety of the procedures. She takes in snatches of hushed conversation regarding the investigation, including notations from a brief interview with Sam, the grocer.
Eventually, Noonan suggests Mary find a place to stay and offers to let Mary stay in his own home with him and his wife. Mary rejects the offer, saying that she is too emotionally spent to move from her chair. The number of investigators begins to dwindle, but the process continues around her as Noonan explains that the focus is now on finding the murder weapon. The police believe it must be a large, heavy metal object that is likely still somewhere on the premises.
Mary suggests that a few sips of whiskey might have restorative powers for her. As Noonan accommodates her request, she proposes that perhaps he and the few remaining investigators might also be restored by a small drink. Hesitantly, each of the men accepts. Noonan points out that the leg of lamb is still cooking and offers to turn off the oven. Grateful, Mary expresses to Noonan that the investigative team must be hungry by now, and that the departed Patrick would want her to be hospitable to his colleagues. They would be doing her a great favor if they would dine on the now fully cooked lamb, which she can no longer bring herself to eat.
Though reluctant to accept at first, the team is genuinely hungry and they ultimately acquiesce. While seated around the kitchen table, they engage in a hearty discussion about how the doctor’s report on the deathblow indicates that the murder weapon must have been heavy, too awkward to be easily removed, and is probably somewhere nearby. Oblivious, they eat the leg of lamb while they talk, unaware that the murder weapon is indeed right under their noses.
Mary, still seated in the living room, listens and giggles quietly to herself."
Court,"An ambitious, worldly young bank official named Joseph K. is arrested by two warders ""one fine morning,"" although he has done nothing wrong. K. is indignant and outraged. The morning happens to be that of his thirtieth birthday. One year later, on the morning of his thirty-first birthday, two warders again come for K. They take him to a quarry outside of town and kill him in the name of the Law. K. lets them.

The Trial is the chronicle of that intervening year of K.'s case, his struggles and encounters with the invisible Law and the untouchable Court. It is an account, ultimately, of state-induced self-destruction. Yet, as in all of Kafka's best writing, the ""meaning"" is far from clear. Just as the parable related by the chaplain in Chapter Nine (called ""The Doorkeeper"" or ""Before the Law"") elicits endless commentary from students of the Law, so has The Trial been a touchstone of twentieth-century critical interpretation. As some commentators have noted, it has, in parts, the quality of revealed truth; as such it is ultimately unresolvable--a mirror for any sectarian reading.
How to summarize this kind of text? It was written during 1914-1915, while Kafka was an official in the Workmen's Accident Insurance Institute for the Kingdom of Bohemia. On one level we can see in The Trial a satirical pillorying of the Austro-Hungarian bureaucracy of Kafka's day. Yet to many readers it is eerily prescient of the psychological weaponry used by the much more insidious totalitarian regimes to come, of the legally-sanctioned death machines Kafka never lived to see. It is also an unfinished novel, and this is apparent in the final chapters. It is at times as suffocating to read as the airless rooms of the Court that it describes. The German title, Der Prozess, connotes both a ""trial"" and a ""process,"" and it is perhaps this maddening feeling of inevitability that leaves a lasting visceral impression: the machinery has been set in motion, and the process will grind toward conclusion despite our most desperate exhortations."
Goal,"Lawyer Bryan Stevenson gives a first-person account of his decades helping marginalized Americans who have been unfairly and harshly punished by the U.S. criminal justice system, which disproportionately targets people of color and poor people. At the heart of Just Mercy is the story of Walter McMillian, a Black man who was framed for the murder of a girl named Ronda Morrison, convicted, and sent to death row. 
Stevenson alternates chapters about Walter with his personal reflections on our country’s history with racial disparity and issues around incarceration. Stevenson highlights other groups of vulnerable people who have been victimized by the criminal justice system and shares the stories of the prisoners he has helped over the years. The book also follows the growth of Stevenson’s nonprofit law project, the Alabama-based Equal Justice Initiative (EJI), through its expansion from focusing on death row prisoners to helping people sentenced to life without parole. Stevenson chronicles how EJI becomes a significant force in criminal justice reform.
In 1983 as a law student, Stevenson discovers his life’s passion when he interns with the Georgia-based Southern Prisoners Defense Committee and meets his first death row prisoner. After graduation Stevenson accepts a job with the organization to represent poor prisoners, including those in Alabama who lack any public defender. He meets Walter McMillian on Alabama’s death row. Walter owns a successful business but also transgresses racial boundaries when he has an affair with a white woman. Soon after the affair becomes public, the woman’s friend, Ralph Myers, accuses Walter of committing the unsolved murder of Ronda Morrison, which has outraged the community. Law enforcement, including a racist sheriff and the district attorney, eagerly pounces on this accusation, overlooking Walter’s alibi and a lack of evidence. Instead, they actively force Ralph to stick with his story even when he tries to recant. They coerce other false witness testimonies, and—as revealed years later—actively suppress evidence.
After Stevenson and the team at EJI unsuccessfully appeal Walter’s conviction, they launch their own investigation of the crime and uncover new evidence. They find witnesses who can prove the witnesses against Walter lied as well as financial records that indicate that one of these witnesses was paid to give false testimony. Stevenson and his team also petition for and receive all records from Walter’s trial. However, their big break comes when they receive a phone call from Ralph, who now wants to make amends. Ralph admits to lying about Walter and says he was threatened by law enforcement. Stevenson wins a hearing for Walter where he can present his new evidence: Ralph’s testimony, which is confirmed by health care workers and other inmates, as well as recordings of the law enforcement team threatening Ralph if he doesn’t frame Walter. 
While the judge refuses to grant Walter relief, Stevenson continues the appeal process through the Alabama courts. The district attorney asks outside agents to investigate the murder for which Walter was convicted, and the investigators determine that Walter had nothing to do with the crime. Six weeks later, the court invalidates Walter’s conviction. Stevenson and the State file a joint motion to dismiss the charges, and Walter is set free.
Throughout the process, Stevenson and Walter become close friends, and Stevenson helps Walter upon his release, including filing a civil suit on his behalf and offering him a place to stay. Walter works with Stevenson to share his story, giving interviews and speaking at legal conferences, and Walter is even featured in a documentary. Unfortunately, Walter is diagnosed with advancing dementia and is forced to rely on family and eventually a nursing facility for his care. He dies in 2013. Stevenson gives a eulogy at his funeral and shares all he learned from Walter, particularly that we must extend mercy to everyone, even those who have not earned it.
Interspersed with chapters chronicling Walter’s narrative are stories of Stevenson’s other clients and work. His closeness with these prisoners and their horrifying circumstances makes Stevenson more determined to help and causes him to reflect on abstract issues that nevertheless imbue the criminal justice system, like humanity and mercy. Stevenson focuses on several categories of vulnerable people who become trapped in the system, including mentally ill prisoners, disabled prisoners, and poor women who give birth to stillborn babies. 
Stevenson and his team at EJI also become increasingly focused on juvenile offenders who are sometimes tried as adults despite their young age. These offenders may be given de facto death sentences by being sentenced to life without parole and face perilous circumstances when they are housed in adult prisons. Stevenson illustrates how these prisoners retain their own humanity while being forced to live under inhumane conditions. He also discusses some of the qualities common among these types of prisoners: They are generally poor and disproportionately people of color, and most of them lack adequate legal counsel. The juveniles have horrific backgrounds of abuse and neglect.
Stevenson and his team at EJI also work to change the legal system to offer more protection to marginalized people. Several of his cases end up before the U.S. Supreme Court, and he succeeds in winning rulings that ban as unconstitutional the conviction of children to life without parole and the execution of people deemed incompetent from dementia or neurological disease. EJI works to raise public awareness of issues surrounding unfair incarceration, produces groundbreaking reports on racial issues, and sets up programs to help formerly incarcerated people adjust to life on the outside.
Stevenson also reflects on the issues that surround the criminal justice system. His time spent with prisoners awaiting their execution makes him realize how inhumane it is to prepare another human to die. After decades of work, when Stevenson fails to prevent the execution of a man who suffers from an intellectual disability, he momentarily feels unable to continue his work. However, he realizes that he cannot help but be broken by his experiences and comes to understand that it is his own brokenness that allows him to more fully understand the need for mercy and to bring compassion to others. The book ends with Stevenson’s renewed commitment to helping others."
Off,"Out of My Mind is told from the point of view of an eleven-year-old girl named Melody Brooks who was born with cerebral palsy. Melody cannot walk, talk, feed herself, or take herself to the bathroom. Her parents work hard at taking care of Melody. Their next-door neighbor, Mrs. Violet Valencia, also known as Mrs. V, is Melody’s part-time caregiver. Melody is extremely intelligent and absorbs all that she hears and sees. She has a photographic memory. She finds that she can hear colors and smell images when music is played. Melody wishes she wasn’t so restricted and wants to be able to live and communicate like any other kid.
When Melody is five years old, her mother takes her to a doctor, Dr. Hugely, to determine how smart she is and whether she can be enrolled in school. The doctor gives Melody inadequate assessments. He determines that Melody is severely brain-damaged. He suggests her parents send her to a school for the developmentally disabled or put her in a residential facility, so they do not have the burden of raising her. Her mother knows there is so much more to Melody and that she has true intelligence inside her. She tells Dr. Hugely he is wrong and insensitive, and she is going to enroll Melody in Spaulding Street Elementary School.
Melody starts elementary school and spends the next five years in a program designed for children with special needs. Initially, she is excited to be in classroom H-5, but eventually finds the learning program to be repetitive and unchallenging. When Melody was younger, her mother had attached a plastic tray to her wheelchair with common words, numbers, and phrases pasted on it for Melody to point to so she could communicate. Over time, that tray becomes too simplistic for Melody. Mrs. V wants to help Melody gain more language skills. She redesigns Melody’s communication board with a larger variety of nouns, verbs, adjectives, and pictures of people in her life so that Melody can point to them with her thumb and form a sentence. Mrs. V creates flash cards and teaches Melody new words every day. When Melody turns eight, her parents surprise her with a puppy named Butterscotch. A short time later, they welcome a new baby girl to the family, giving Melody a little sister named Penny.
When Melody starts fifth grade, her parents present her with an electric wheelchair, which gives Melody a sense of freedom she has never had before. Her school also starts an inclusion program to allow the H-5 students to interact with the other classes. During these classes, Melody meets a nice girl named Rose. Unfortunately, she also encounters two girls, Molly and Claire, who both have a reputation for being mean to almost everyone. Melody’s teacher, Mrs. Shannon, hires Catherine as an aide to help Melody in her classes. Melody and Catherine find a device called a Medi-Talker on the internet to help Melody communicate. Melody’s parents order it for her. The device provides a voice for her thoughts.
In Melody’s language arts class, her teacher, Miss Gordon, tells the students about an autobiography project they will be doing at the end of the year. Mr. Dimming, Melody’s history teacher, has the class participate in a practice exercise for their school’s Whiz Kids quiz team. Every year the school sends a team to the Whiz Kids competition. During the practice exercise, Melody achieves a perfect score. Her teacher and her classmates, particularly Molly and Claire, are shocked and skeptical. This skepticism bothers Melody but with the help of Catherine in school, and Mrs. V after school, she studies hard to properly prepare for the team tryouts. Melody takes the real test, getting another perfect score, and secures a place on the school team. Mr. Dimming apologizes to Melody for underestimating her. The quiz team spends the next two weeks studying and practicing after school. Even though Melody is part of the team, she does not feel a sense of belonging.
The Spaulding Street Elementary team competes in the southwest Ohio regional competition and wins. Melody receives an unwanted amount of media attention, which makes her team members jealous.
The Brooks family and Mrs. V take Melody and her mom to the airport so they can catch a plane headed to the Whiz Kids national finals in Washington, D.C. When they arrive at the airport, an airline employee informs them that their plane has been canceled due to bad weather. She tells them that the rest of the team arrived early and was able to board a different flight before the cancellations began. Melody is distraught that her team left her behind.
The next morning, Melody’s father comes into her room with the news that the team came in ninth place in the D.C. finals and won a tiny trophy. Melody decides she wants to go to school to show that she can rise above the whole situation and to see Catherine. It’s a very stormy day and due to the lightning, Melody is forced to use her manual wheelchair and her old Plexiglas communication board. With difficulty, her mother gets her into the car for school. Suddenly, Melody sees Penny run out of the house. Melody realizes her mother didn’t notice, so she starts frantically screaming and flailing about. Her mother, frustrated with Melody and the morning’s events, starts backing the car down the driveway, and they feel a soft thump. Horrified, they realize it was Penny. Penny has a badly broken leg and will undergo a surgical procedure, but she will be fine.
Melody goes to school to face her quiz team teammates. They all make excuses, even Mr. Dimming, as to why they didn’t call her and why they left her behind. The team wants to give Melody their little plastic trophy to make up for it. Melody starts giggling when suddenly her hand jerks, knocking the trophy to the ground and causing it to break. She uses her Medi-Talker to say that she doesn’t want it and they deserve it. Still laughing, she leaves the room.
At the end of fifth grade, Melody thinks that maybe she is not so different from everyone else after all. Perhaps she carries some of the same worries and attitudes as other fifth graders. She starts working on her autobiography for Miss Gordon’s class. She begins her autobiography titled Out of My Mind with ""I'm surrounded by thousands of words,"" the exact same words that start the book."
Regions,"On the night that a fire rages between the woods of Fanteland and Asanteland, Effia is born. Throughout her childhood, her mother, Baaba, is extremely cruel. As Effia grows, Baaba tells her to keep the fact that she has begun menstruating a secret so that she cannot marry their village’s new chief. Instead, Effia is sent to marry the British governor of Cape Coast Castle, James Collins. While pregnant, Effia returns to her village as her father is dying. There, she learns from her brother Fiifi that Baaba was not her real mother. Her mother was an enslaved girl named Maame who ran away into the fire the night Effia was born. Though Effia doesn’t know this, Maame married a Big Man in an Asante village and gave birth to another girl, Esi. Esi has a privileged childhood but is captured at fifteen and taken to the dungeon of the Cape Coast Castle. There, she is raped and then put on a slave ship to America.
Effia’s son Quey has a lonely childhood at the castle, though he makes friends with a boy named Cudjo. However, after Quey’s father witnesses a tender moment between the two boys, he sends Quey to live in London. Quey later goes to his mother’s village to help his uncle, Fiifi, with his work in the slave trade. Though this is not the life Quey wants, he marries the daughter of an Asante king, Nana Yaa, whom Fiifi kidnapped. Meanwhile, Esi’s daughter Ness is enslaved on a plantation in Alabama. At a previous plantation, she was forced to marry another slave, Sam, and they had a child named Kojo. One day, Ness, Sam, and Kojo attempt to escape with the help of a woman named Aku, but Ness and Sam are caught. Back at the plantation, Ness is whipped and Sam is lynched.
When Quey and Nana Yaa’s son, James, travels with them to Nana Yaa’s father’s funeral, he becomes enamored with a girl named Akosua, who chastises his family’s involvement in the slave trade. Though James is promised to marry another woman, he’s determined to marry Akosua. Eventually, James fakes his own death and finds Akosua. On Esi’s side, Aku and Kojo escape to Maryland, where Kojo, or “Jo,” works as a deckhand. Jo and his wife Anna worry about their family’s safety after the passage of the Fugitive Slave Act. One day, Anna doesn’t return home from work. After a few weeks, Jo learns that Anna was taken by a white man. Once his children are grown, a broken Jo moves to New York.
Quey and Akosua’s daughter, Abena, is unmarried at the age of twenty-five, though she is waiting for her childhood friend Ohene Nyarko to take her as his second wife. Abena and Ohene begin sleeping together, but he cannot promise to marry her until he has a good harvest. For years, the harvest is bad, and the village blames Abena. Eventually, Ohene is able to grow cocoa but promised to marry the daughter of the man who sold the plants to him. Now pregnant, Abena leaves the village for a missionary church.
In America, Jo and Anna’s son H is born on a plantation just after Anna has killed herself. H works as a sharecropper after the Civil War. After being arrested for looking at a white woman, H works in the mines as a convict. When his sentence is up, H moves to Pratt City, where he continues to work in mines but joins a union to fight for better pay and working conditions. Though his wife, Ethe, left him years earlier, he writes to her, and she returns to him.
Abena’s daughter, Akua, grows up in the missionary where her mother Abena lived after leaving the village. Akua leaves the church after the missionary tells her he drowned Abena while attempting to baptize her. Akua marries and has two daughters and a son, though she is plagued by dreams of a woman made of fire. One night, in her sleep, Akua burns her family’s hut. Only Akua, her husband, and her son, Yaw, survive. Meanwhile, H and Ethe’s daughter, Willie, moves to Harlem with her husband, Robert, and their son, Carson. Robert is light-skinned and passes as white in Harlem, which allows him to easily find work. One night, while cleaning a jazz club, Willie runs into Robert in the bathroom, and Robert’s white colleagues force him to assault her. Robert then leaves Willie. A few years later, Willie sees Robert with a white wife and son.
Yaw grows up to be a history teacher, though he has trouble finding a wife due to the scars on his face from the fire his mother set. He eventually falls in love with his house girl, Esther. She encourages Yaw to make peace with Akua, whom he hasn’t seen since he was a baby. Yaw and Esther visit Akua, who explains that she set the fire because she was haunted by the evil in their lineage. Yaw forgives his mother.
Willie’s son Carson, who now goes by the name Sonny, works for the NAACP and is involved in the Civil Rights Movement, though he feels frustrated with the lack of progress. Sonny becomes addicted to heroin after a woman, Amani, introduces him to the drug. One day, Willie explains to Sonny what happened to his father. With this knowledge, Sonny decides to finally get clean.
Yaw and Esther move to Alabama with their daughter, Marjorie. Marjorie feels a deep connection to her grandmother and to Ghana and does not fit in with either the Black or white kids in Alabama. Marjorie develops feelings for her friend Graham, a white boy, though he feels they cannot be together due to their different races. Marjorie later meets Marcus, Sonny and Amani’s son, while they are both graduate students at Stanford. Marcus and Marjorie travel together to Ghana, where Marcus is overwhelmed with emotions on visiting the Cape Coast Castle. They swim together in the water, and Marjorie welcomes Marcus home."
Tests,"The poor peddler John Durbeyfield is stunned to learn that he is the descendent of an ancient noble family, the d’Urbervilles. Meanwhile, Tess, his eldest daughter, joins the other village girls in the May Day dance, where Tess briefly exchanges glances with a young man. Mr. Durbeyfield and his wife decide to send Tess to the d’Urberville mansion, where they hope Mrs. d’Urberville will make Tess’s fortune. In reality, Mrs. d’Urberville is no relation to Tess at all: her husband, the merchant Simon Stokes, simply changed his name to d’Urberville after he retired. But Tess does not know this fact, and when the lascivious Alec d’Urberville, Mrs. d’Urberville’s son, procures Tess a job tending fowls on the d’Urberville estate, Tess has no choice but to accept, since she blames herself for an accident involving the family’s horse, its only means of income.
Tess spends several months at this job, resisting Alec’s attempts to seduce her. Finally, Alec takes advantage of her in the woods one night after a fair. Tess knows she does not love Alec. She returns home to her family to give birth to Alec’s child, whom she christens Sorrow. Sorrow dies soon after he is born, and Tess spends a miserable year at home before deciding to seek work elsewhere. She finally accepts a job as a milkmaid at the Talbothays Dairy.
At Talbothays, Tess enjoys a period of contentment and happiness. She befriends three of her fellow milkmaids—Izz, Retty, and Marian—and meets a man named Angel Clare, who turns out to be the man from the May Day dance at the beginning of the novel. Tess and Angel slowly fall in love. They grow closer throughout Tess’s time at Talbothays, and she eventually accepts his proposal of marriage. Still, she is troubled by pangs of conscience and feels she should tell Angel about her past. She writes him a confessional note and slips it under his door, but it slides under the carpet and Angel never sees it.
After their wedding, Angel and Tess both confess indiscretions: Angel tells Tess about an affair he had with an older woman in London, and Tess tells Angel about her history with Alec. Tess forgives Angel, but Angel cannot forgive Tess. He gives her some money and boards a ship bound for Brazil, where he thinks he might establish a farm. He tells Tess he will try to accept her past but warns her not to try to join him until he comes for her.
Tess struggles. She has a difficult time finding work and is forced to take a job at an unpleasant and unprosperous farm. She tries to visit Angel’s family but overhears his brothers discussing Angel’s poor marriage, so she leaves. She hears a wandering preacher speak and is stunned to discover that he is Alec d’Urberville, who has been converted to Christianity by Angel’s father, the Reverend Clare. Alec and Tess are each shaken by their encounter, and Alec appallingly begs Tess never to tempt him again. Soon after, however, he again begs Tess to marry him, having turned his back on his -religious ways.
Tess learns from her sister Liza-Lu that her mother is near death, and Tess is forced to return home to take care of her. Her mother recovers, but her father unexpectedly dies soon after. When the family is evicted from their home, Alec offers help. But Tess refuses to accept, knowing he only wants to obligate her to him again.
At last, Angel decides to forgive his wife. He leaves Brazil, desperate to find her. Instead, he finds her mother, who tells him Tess has gone to a village called Sandbourne. There, he finds Tess in an expensive boardinghouse called The Herons, where he tells her he has forgiven her and begs her to take him back. Tess tells him he has come too late. She was unable to resist and went back to Alec d’Urberville. Angel leaves in a daze, and, heartbroken to the point of madness, Tess goes upstairs and stabs her lover to death. When the landlady finds Alec’s body, she raises an alarm, but Tess has already fled to find Angel.
Angel agrees to help Tess, though he cannot quite believe that she has actually murdered Alec. They hide out in an empty mansion for a few days, then travel farther. When they come to Stonehenge, Tess goes to sleep, but when morning breaks shortly thereafter, a search party discovers them. Tess is arrested and sent to jail. Angel and Liza-Lu watch as a black flag is raised over the prison, signaling Tess’s execution."
Await,"Meursault, the narrator, is a young man living in Algiers. After receiving a telegram informing him of his mother’s death, he takes a bus to Marengo, where his mother had been living in an old persons’ home. He sleeps for almost the entire trip. When he arrives, he speaks to the director of the home. The director allows Meursault to see his mother, but Meursault finds that her body has already been sealed in the coffin. He declines the caretaker’s offer to open the coffin.
That night, Meursault keeps vigil over his mother’s body. Much to his displeasure, the talkative caretaker stays with him the whole time. Meursault smokes a cigarette, drinks coffee, and dozes off. The next morning, before the funeral, he meets with the director again. The director informs him that Thomas Perez, an old man who had grown very close to Meursault’s mother, will be attending the funeral service. The funeral procession heads for the small local village, but Perez has difficulty keeping up and eventually faints from the heat. Meursault reports that he remembers little of the funeral. That night, he happily arrives back in Algiers.
The next day, Meursault goes to the public beach for a swim. There, he runs into Marie Cardona, his former co-worker. The two make a date to see a comedy at the movie theater that evening. After the movie they spend the night together. When Meursault wakes up, Marie is gone. He stays in bed until noon and then sits on his balcony until evening, watching the people pass on the street.
The following day, Monday, Meursault returns to work. He has lunch with his friend Emmanuel and then works all afternoon. While walking upstairs to his apartment that night, Meursault runs into Salamano, an old man who lives in his building and owns a mangy dog. Meursault also runs into his neighbor, Raymond Sintes, who is widely rumored to be a pimp. Raymond invites Meursault over for dinner. Over the meal, Raymond recounts how he beat up his mistress after he discovered that she had been cheating on him. As a result, he got into a fight with her brother. Raymond now wants to torment his mistress even more, but he needs Meursault to write a letter to lure his mistress back to him. Meursault agrees and writes the letter that night.
The following Saturday, Marie visits Meursault at his apartment. She asks Meursault if he loves her, and he replies that “it didn’t mean anything,” but probably not. The two then hear shouting coming from Raymond’s apartment. They go out into the hall and watch as a policeman arrives. The policeman slaps Raymond and says that he will be summoned to the police station for beating up his mistress. Later, Raymond asks Meursault to testify on his behalf, and Meursault agrees. That night, Raymond runs into Salamano, who laments that his dog has run away.
Marie asks Meursault if he wants to marry her. He replies indifferently but says that they can get married if she wants to, so they become engaged. The following Sunday, Meursault, Marie, and Raymond go to a beach house owned by Masson, one of Raymond’s friends. They swim happily in the ocean and then have lunch. That afternoon, Masson, Raymond, and Meursault run into two Arabs on the beach, one of whom is the brother of Raymond’s mistress. A fight breaks out and Raymond is stabbed. After tending to his wounds, Raymond returns to the beach with Meursault. They find the Arabs at a spring. Raymond considers shooting them with his gun, but Meursault talks him out of it and takes the gun away. Later, however, Meursault returns to the spring to cool off, and, for no apparent reason, he shoots Raymond’s mistress’s brother.
Meursault is arrested and thrown into jail. His lawyer seems disgusted at Meursault’s lack of remorse over his crime, and, in particular, at Meursault’s lack of grief at his mother’s funeral. Later, Meursault meets with the examining magistrate, who cannot understand Meursault’s actions. The magistrate brandishes a crucifix and demands that Meursault put his faith in God. Meursault refuses, insisting that he does not believe in God. The magistrate cannot accept Meursault’s lack of belief, and eventually dubs him “Monsieur Antichrist.”
One day, Marie visits Meursault in prison. She forces herself to smile during the visit, and she expresses hope that Meursault will be acquitted and that they will get married. As he awaits his trial, Meursault slowly adapts to prison life. His isolation from nature, women, and cigarettes torments him at first, but he eventually adjusts to living without them, and soon does not even notice their absence. He manages to keep his mind occupied, and he sleeps for most of each day.
Meursault is taken to the courthouse early on the morning of his trial. Spectators and members of the press fill the courtroom. The subject of the trial quickly shifts away from the murder to a general discussion of Meursault’s character, and of his reaction to his mother’s death in particular. The director and several other people who attended the vigil and the funeral are called to testify, and they all attest to Meursault’s lack of grief or tears. Marie reluctantly testifies that the day after his mother’s funeral she and Meursault went on a date and saw a comedic movie. During his summation the following day, the prosecutor calls Meursault a monster and says that his lack of moral feeling threatens all of society. Meursault is found guilty and is sentenced to death by beheading.
Meursault returns to prison to await his execution. He struggles to come to terms with his situation, and he has trouble accepting the certainty and inevitability of his fate. He imagines escaping and he dreams of filing a successful legal appeal. One day, the chaplain comes to visit against Meursault’s wishes. He urges Meursault to renounce his atheism and turn to God, but Meursault refuses. Like the magistrate, the chaplain cannot believe that Meursault does not long for faith and the afterlife. Meursault suddenly becomes enraged, grabs the chaplain, and begins shouting at him. He declares that he is correct in believing in a meaningless, purely physical world. For the first time, Meursault truly embraces the idea that human existence holds no greater meaning. He abandons all hope for the future and accepts the “gentle indifference of the world.” This acceptance makes Meursault feel happy."
Thriving,"In the year 2045, climate change, war and poverty have ruined most of Earth’s societies. Most people find escape and relief in the OASIS, a multiplayer online game with thousands of different locations, including games, online shopping, and even a thriving school system. Most people in the world have OASIS accounts, as there are no recurring fees and it offers an escape from the real world. The creator of the OASIS, James Halliday, has left a contest that will transfer the ownership of the OASIS and its parent company to whoever finds his Easter egg. Since the company is worth billions of dollars, many users have been trying to figure out the clues that lead to Halliday’s Easter egg for years. 
In “Level One,” Wade Watts describes his adventures trying to win Halliday’s contest. He is a high school student who lives in trailer park in Oklahoma City. Since he lives in poverty and has poor social skills, he dedicates his life to being a “gunter” (egg hunter). Since the contest was announced, no one has made any meaningful progress. Gunters are OASIS users who have not given up on finding Halliday’s Easter egg. Wade’s online avatar, Parzival, and Wade’s friend Aech spend almost all of their time looking for clues. 
Wade eventually figures out the location of the Copper Key, the first step in finding Halliday’s egg. Wade also meets a fellow gunter named Art3mis. Even though she is his competition, he has a crush on her. After acquiring the key, Wade soon passes through the First Gate. Upon doing so, his avatar becomes instantly famous across the OASIS. Art3mis, Aech, and two other gunters (Daito and Shoto) soon clear the First Gate as well. Wade is contacted by the Sixers, members of the corporation IOI, who regularly employ unfair tactics to win Halliday’s contest. Wade speaks to the leader of the Sixers, Nolan Sorrento. Sorrento threatens to kill Wade in the real world. Wade does not cooperate and the trailer where Wade’s family lives is destroyed in a large explosion. Wade warns his friends, creates a fake identity, and leaves Oklahoma City.
In “Level Two,” Wade has difficulty figuring out how to get the Jade Key, the next item in his quest. He spends more time with Art3mis and eventually professes his love for her. She breaks up with him. His friends clear the Jade Key, as do the Sixers, and eventually Aech gives him a hint. Wade acquires the Jade Key, but the Sixers have already cleared the Second Gate and have acquired the Crystal Key. Shoto contacts him and tells him that the Sixers broke into Daito’s real-world apartment and killed him. Wade eventually figures out the clues to clear the Second Gate and then acquire the Crystal Key. He also figures out the location of the Third Gate, but the Sixers are ahead of him and have set up an impenetrable barrier to its location. He gives his friends explicit instructions on how to acquire the same items and begins to formulate a dangerous plan.
In “Level Three,” Wade allows himself to be captured by IOI and sent to their indentured work program as a prisoner. Since he is using his false identity, they do not know that he is Wade/Parzival. Once inside IOI, he uses hacking resources to steal evidence of their criminal activity and set up a chain of events that will allow his group to reach the Third Gate. Wade uses his computer skills and access to escape the IOI work prison. He warns his friends that the Sixers are planning to kidnap them to win the contest. He also sends all the criminal activity that he has uncovered to every news outlet. 
Wade and his friends are contacted by Ogden Morrow, James Halliday’s original business partner, who gives them refuge from the Sixers. There is a giant battle between all the clans of gunters and the Sixers outside the third gate. The Sixers use every tactic that they can to try to stop Wade. Fighting through the Sixer soldiers, Wade enters the Third Gate. He solves more of Halliday’s puzzles and reaches Halliday’s Easter egg, just before the Sixers. He splits the winnings with his friends and meets Art3mis for the first time in the real world. They share a romantic moment, and Wade is no longer concerned with the OASIS."
Inaugurated,"Educated is primarily retrospective, consisting of Tara Westover's memories about her past. She tells the story of the events of her life from a vantage point in her late twenties, occasionally interjecting to comment on the process of trying to arrive at an accurate version of the past. Tara was born the youngest of seven children to parents whom she refers to as Faye and Gene (pseudonyms). The Westover family lived on a farm in rural Idaho, where Gene made a living salvaging scrap metal while Faye worked as an unlicensed midwife and herbal healer. Gene suffered from paranoid fears about interference from the federal government, and as a result he refused to allow his children to attend school, receive birth certificates, or receive medical attention. Gene was also a devout Mormon who believed in radical self-sufficiency and an impending Day of Judgement.
		
Shifts in the Westover family dynamic began to emerge when Tara was about nine. Her mother's work as a midwife increased her sense of independence, but after sustaining a serious and untreated brain injury in a car accident, Faye began to lose confidence in her skills, and focused instead on using herbal remedies and a form of intuitive healing. Around this time, Tyler (the third son) announced that he was going to attend college, which estranged him from his family. Tyler's absence forced Tara to become more involved in helping her father with his scrapping work, which left her constantly exposed to the possibility of dangerous injury. It also made her more curious about possibly pursuing an education herself. When Tara was ten, she told her disapproving father that she wanted to begin going to school, but nothing came of the idea.
As Tara grew into her teens, she acquired more independence from her family due to taking on various jobs and pursuing singing and musical theatre in the local community. However, her life was dominated by the strict rules and religious doctrine her father imposed, and Tara often worried about becoming sinful. When Tara was thirteen, her older brother Shawn moved back home. At first Shawn and Tara were close and spent a lot of time together. When Tara was about fifteen, however, Shawn began to be physically abusive toward her. His behavior only got worse after Shawn experienced a head injury. Tyler eventually realized that Shawn was hurting Tara, and he urged Tara to seriously consider applying to college and getting away from the family. Although she was uncertain at first, Tara began to study and was eventually accepted at Brigham Young University, having passed herself off as homeschooled.
In January 2004, when Tara was seventeen years old, she moved to Utah to begin her college education. She found the adjustment very difficult at first, but eventually began to excel in her studies. Tara's finances were precarious, and she had to hold multiple jobs and maintain very high grades to retain her scholarship. Her emerging independence also caused a threatening dynamic between her, Gene, and Shawn. Whenever Tara returned to Buck's Peak, her father manipulated her into working for him, while Shawn continued to physically and emotionally abuse her. Tara eventually confided to a bishop about her life, and he helped her to secure funding to finance her education. Tara's studies, and the people she met, also gradually opened her eyes to different realities and force her to realize how damaging and isolating her childhood has been. Tara eventually changed her major to studying history, and is encouraged to apply for a study abroad program at Cambridge University in England.
Tara's experience at Cambridge broadened her horizons even further, and she was encouraged to consider graduate studies. Tara still felt isolated from her peers, and ashamed of her origins. She hid most of her past even from her friends and the men she occasionally dated. She was eventually awarded a prestigious Cambridge Gates Fellowship and moved to England to pursue a Master's degree. She remained in close contact with her family and returned to Idaho regularly to visit, but her relationship with them deteriorated. Shawn was growing increasingly erratic and violent, and Tara feared for the safety of his wife and young child. By chance, she revealed to her sister Audrey that Shawn had been abusive with her, and Audrey later confided that Shawn abused her as well. Audrey blamed herself for not protecting her younger sister, and suggested that she and Tara confront their parents and Shawn about what happened to them.
By then Tara had built a happy life for herself in England, and was working on a PhD in history at Cambridge. However, the attempt to speak the truth quickly became a source of conflict in the family. Tara became more and more ostracized within her family, eventually culminating in Shawn learning that she had been telling their parents about the abuse she suffered. Realizing her family would never trust her claims, Tara became estranged from most of them, with the exception of Tyler.  The estrangement from her family prompted grief and depression for Tara, but she was finally able to heal, and successfully completed her PhD. By the end of her memoir, Tara has accepted that she may never have a relationship with her family again, but she takes pride in the independence she has established, and the life she has built for herself."
Political,"In Common Sense, Thomas Paine argues for American independence. His argument begins with more general, theoretical reflections about government and religion, then progresses onto the specifics of the colonial situation.
Paine begins by distinguishing between government and society. Society, according to Paine, is everything constructive and good that people join together to accomplish. Government, on the other hand, is an institution whose sole purpose is to protect us from our own vices. Government has its origins in the evil of man and is therefore a necessary evil at best. Paine says that government's sole purpose is to protect life, liberty and property, and that a government should be judged solely on the basis of the extent to which it accomplishes this goal.
Paine then considers an imagined scenario in which a small group of people has been placed on an island, and cut off from the rest of society. In time, these people develop ties with one another, and lawmaking becomes inevitable. Paine says the people will be much happier if they are responsible for the creation of the laws that rule them. Paine is also implicitly arguing that such a system of representation is also better for the American colonists. Having expressed his disagreement with British reign in America, Paine proceeds to launch a general attack on the British system of government. Paine says the British system is too complex and rife with contradictions, and that the monarchy is granted far too much power. The British system pretends to offer a reasonable system of checks and balances, but in fact, it does not.
From here Paine moves on to discuss, in general, the notions of monarchy and hereditary succession. Man, Pain argues, was born into a state of equality, and the distinction that has arisen between king and subject is an unnatural one. At first, Paine says, the world was without kings, but the ancient Jews decided they wanted a king. This angered God, but he allowed them to have one. Paine presents pages of biblical evidence detailing God's wrath at the idea of the Jews having a king. The conclusion Paine reaches is that the practice of monarchy originates from sin, and is an institution that the Bible and God condemn. Paine calls hereditary succession an abominable practice. He says that even if people were to choose to have a king, that does not legitimize that King's child acting as a future ruler. Furthermore, hereditary succession has brought with it innumerable evils, such as incompetent kings, corruption, and civil war.
Having dispensed with the preliminary theoretical issues, Paine sets in to discuss the details of the American situation. In response to the argument that America has flourished under British rule, and therefore ought to stay under the king, Paine says that such an argument fails to realize that America has evolved and no longer needs Britain's help. Some say that Britain has protected America, and therefore deserves allegiance, but Paine responds that Britain has only watched over America in order to secure its own economic well-being. Paine adds that most recently, instead of watching over the colonies, the British have been attacking them, and are therefore undeserving of American loyalty.
Paine says that the colonies have little to gain from remaining attached to Britain. Commerce can be better conducted with the rest of Europe, but only after America becomes independent. Paine also asserts that if the colonies remain attached to Britain, the same problems that have arisen in the past will arise in the future. Paine argues that it is necessary to seek independence now, as to do otherwise would only briefly cover up problems that will surely reemerge.
Paine even proposes the form of government that the independent colonies should adopt. His recommendation is for a representative democracy that gives roughly equal weight to each of the colonies.
Paine explains why the current time is a good time to break free of Britain. Primarily, Paine focuses on the present size of the colonies, and on their current capabilities. He presents an inventory of the British Navy and gives calculations revealing how America could build a navy of comparable size. Paine recommends this as a way of ensuring America's security and prosperity in trade. Paine also argues that America is sufficiently small as to be united now. If time were to elapse, and the population of the colonies to grow, the same feeling of unity would not be present. Paine adds that if the Americans revolt now, they can use the vast expanses of uncharted land to the West in order to pay down some of the debt they will incur.
Paine says that as a colony of Britain, America lacks respectability on the international scene. They are seen simply as rebels, and cannot form substantial alliances with other nations. In order to prosper in the long term, the colonies need to be independent. Paine says that, by declaring independence, America will be able to ask for the help of other countries in its struggle for freedom. For all of these reasons, Paine says it is imperative and urgent that the colonies declare independence."
Uniformly,"Susanna Kaysen, an eighteen-year-old in April of 1967, agrees to enter McLean Hospital, a residential psychiatric facility in Massachusetts. Although she plans to stay only a few weeks, Kaysen remains at McLean for nearly two years. The doctor who forcefully advocates her committal to a mental hospital interviewed Kaysen for only twenty minutes.
Kaysen tells the story of the people and experiences she encounters at McLean in a series of nonchronological vignettes. Among the patients admitted to her ward, Kaysen describes Polly, a kind patient with disfiguring, self-inflicted burns to her face and body. Lisa, another patient, entertains Kaysen with her escape attempts and exaggerated contempt for hospital authorities. Kaysen’s roommate, Georgina, struggles to maintain a relationship with Wade, a violent and unstable boyfriend from another ward, who tells the girls seemingly outlandish stories about his father’s exploits with the CIA. The twin obsessions of roasted chicken and laxatives make a newly arrived patient named Daisy the object of much speculation. Daisy ultimately leaves the hospital, only to commit suicide on her birthday.
One day, James Watson, a Nobel laureate and friend of the Kaysen family, visits Kaysen. He offers to take her away from the cold, prisonlike facility, but she rejects the offer, convinced that she should stay the course of her treatment. Kaysen discloses an unsuccessful suicide attempt involving an aspirin overdose in high school. She considers the nature of her illness, which includes difficulty making visual sense of patterns, and wonders whether sanity is merely an illusion that people construct to feel “normal.” Because many famous people have been residents of McLean Hospital, Kaysen speculates that creative minds, especially poets’, may be prone to mental illness.
The hospital’s strict rules dictate patients’ daily routines. Nurses perform “checks,” periodic visual appraisals of a patient’s activities and whereabouts, according to a schedule that corresponds to the severity of the patient’s illness. The staff confiscates any possessions that might inflict injury, even earrings and belts. Field trips outside the hospital walls are rare and require a complex system of patient-to-nurse accompaniment. 
Lisa Cody, a new patient, arrives and threatens the social position of a current resident, also named Lisa, who torments the new girl until she leaves McLean and falls into more desperate circumstances. At this point, Kaysen considers the twenty-minute consultation that resulted in her hospitalization. Analysis of hospital records is inconclusive, and Kaysen’s doubts about the accuracy of her memory leads her into a discussion of the nature of mental illness, which Kaysen believes falls into two categories: slow or “viscous” and fast or having “velocity.” Kaysen believes that both kinds of illness result in the same type of mental paralysis.
Kaysen introduces us to Valerie, the young head nurse, who wins the girls’ respect with her no-nonsense approach to the job and a willingness to stand up to the doctors. Dr. Wick, an older psychiatrist, has trouble relating to the youth culture of her patients and becomes uncomfortable during any discussion of sex. The girls uniformly detest Mrs. McWeeney, the evening nurse, who is decidedly old-fashioned in her dress, speech, and insistence on strict authority. 
The year 1968 is an exciting and frightening year, and Kaysen and the other girls watch its tumultuous events unfold on television. Simply viewing the world’s turbulence temporarily calms them. The girls come to realize that they are sitting on the sidelines of the era’s events and their own lives.
Torrey, a methamphetamine addict from Mexico, arrives on the ward. Torrey’s parents are embarrassed by their daughter’s problems. When Torrey’s parents come to retrieve her, Lisa attempts to help her escape her parents, but Valerie doses Torrey with Thorazine to foil the plan. The other girls fall into a depression. Kaysen suffers an episode of depersonalization that leads her to attempt to tear open her hand to confirm that she has bones beneath the skin.
Kaysen’s wisdom tooth becomes infected, and Valerie takes her from McLean to a dentist in Boston. Kaysen becomes frantic when, upon waking from the general anesthesia, no one will tell her how long she was unconscious. She worries that she has “lost” time. 
A new patient named Alice Calais enters the ward, but a mental breakdown leads to her transfer to maximum security. The girls visit Alice, whose condition and living arrangements sicken them. They vow never to let the same thing happen to them. Kaysen starts sessions with Melvin, a therapist with whom she begins an advanced form of analysis. Enthralled with the tunnels below the hospital, Kaysen struggles to convey their meaning to Melvin. She discovers she is Melvin’s first patient, and then she gladly leaves analysis behind. 
As Kaysen heals, she searches for a job outside the hospital, quickly becoming acquainted with the widespread prejudice that haunts former mental patients. Even applying for telephone service or a driver’s license requires a doctor’s note. Kaysen resumes a relationship she began with a man she knew before entering the hospital and impulsively accepts his marriage proposal. Reflecting on the difference between the mind and the brain, Kaysen wonders whether doctors treat one at the expense of the other. She reveals her diagnosis: borderline personality disorder. Dissecting the medical definition of the disorder, Kaysen notes that it is much more commonly diagnosed in women than in men. She wonders to what degree sexism and psychiatric fads influence the diagnoses. 
Some years after leaving McLean, Kaysen visits Georgina, now married and as eccentric as ever. Kaysen also runs into Lisa, who has a young child and lives in a respectable suburb. Kaysen detects traces of Lisa’s old personality beneath the persona of a suburban mother. In the final chapter, Kaysen reveals the origin of the title of the book, Girl, Interrupted. Separated by some twenty years, Kaysen stands in front of the painting at New York’s Frick Museum. The painting holds very different meanings on each occasion; the changing interpretation reflects Kaysen’s life experience."
Adjustments,"Lawyer Bryan Stevenson gives a first-person account of his decades helping marginalized Americans who have been unfairly and harshly punished by the U.S. criminal justice system, which disproportionately targets people of color and poor people. At the heart of Just Mercy is the story of Walter McMillian, a Black man who was framed for the murder of a girl named Ronda Morrison, convicted, and sent to death row. 
Stevenson alternates chapters about Walter with his personal reflections on our country’s history with racial disparity and issues around incarceration. Stevenson highlights other groups of vulnerable people who have been victimized by the criminal justice system and shares the stories of the prisoners he has helped over the years. The book also follows the growth of Stevenson’s nonprofit law project, the Alabama-based Equal Justice Initiative (EJI), through its expansion from focusing on death row prisoners to helping people sentenced to life without parole. Stevenson chronicles how EJI becomes a significant force in criminal justice reform.
In 1983 as a law student, Stevenson discovers his life’s passion when he interns with the Georgia-based Southern Prisoners Defense Committee and meets his first death row prisoner. After graduation Stevenson accepts a job with the organization to represent poor prisoners, including those in Alabama who lack any public defender. He meets Walter McMillian on Alabama’s death row. Walter owns a successful business but also transgresses racial boundaries when he has an affair with a white woman. Soon after the affair becomes public, the woman’s friend, Ralph Myers, accuses Walter of committing the unsolved murder of Ronda Morrison, which has outraged the community. Law enforcement, including a racist sheriff and the district attorney, eagerly pounces on this accusation, overlooking Walter’s alibi and a lack of evidence. Instead, they actively force Ralph to stick with his story even when he tries to recant. They coerce other false witness testimonies, and—as revealed years later—actively suppress evidence.
After Stevenson and the team at EJI unsuccessfully appeal Walter’s conviction, they launch their own investigation of the crime and uncover new evidence. They find witnesses who can prove the witnesses against Walter lied as well as financial records that indicate that one of these witnesses was paid to give false testimony. Stevenson and his team also petition for and receive all records from Walter’s trial. However, their big break comes when they receive a phone call from Ralph, who now wants to make amends. Ralph admits to lying about Walter and says he was threatened by law enforcement. Stevenson wins a hearing for Walter where he can present his new evidence: Ralph’s testimony, which is confirmed by health care workers and other inmates, as well as recordings of the law enforcement team threatening Ralph if he doesn’t frame Walter. 
While the judge refuses to grant Walter relief, Stevenson continues the appeal process through the Alabama courts. The district attorney asks outside agents to investigate the murder for which Walter was convicted, and the investigators determine that Walter had nothing to do with the crime. Six weeks later, the court invalidates Walter’s conviction. Stevenson and the State file a joint motion to dismiss the charges, and Walter is set free.
Throughout the process, Stevenson and Walter become close friends, and Stevenson helps Walter upon his release, including filing a civil suit on his behalf and offering him a place to stay. Walter works with Stevenson to share his story, giving interviews and speaking at legal conferences, and Walter is even featured in a documentary. Unfortunately, Walter is diagnosed with advancing dementia and is forced to rely on family and eventually a nursing facility for his care. He dies in 2013. Stevenson gives a eulogy at his funeral and shares all he learned from Walter, particularly that we must extend mercy to everyone, even those who have not earned it.
Interspersed with chapters chronicling Walter’s narrative are stories of Stevenson’s other clients and work. His closeness with these prisoners and their horrifying circumstances makes Stevenson more determined to help and causes him to reflect on abstract issues that nevertheless imbue the criminal justice system, like humanity and mercy. Stevenson focuses on several categories of vulnerable people who become trapped in the system, including mentally ill prisoners, disabled prisoners, and poor women who give birth to stillborn babies. 
Stevenson and his team at EJI also become increasingly focused on juvenile offenders who are sometimes tried as adults despite their young age. These offenders may be given de facto death sentences by being sentenced to life without parole and face perilous circumstances when they are housed in adult prisons. Stevenson illustrates how these prisoners retain their own humanity while being forced to live under inhumane conditions. He also discusses some of the qualities common among these types of prisoners: They are generally poor and disproportionately people of color, and most of them lack adequate legal counsel. The juveniles have horrific backgrounds of abuse and neglect.
Stevenson and his team at EJI also work to change the legal system to offer more protection to marginalized people. Several of his cases end up before the U.S. Supreme Court, and he succeeds in winning rulings that ban as unconstitutional the conviction of children to life without parole and the execution of people deemed incompetent from dementia or neurological disease. EJI works to raise public awareness of issues surrounding unfair incarceration, produces groundbreaking reports on racial issues, and sets up programs to help formerly incarcerated people adjust to life on the outside.
Stevenson also reflects on the issues that surround the criminal justice system. His time spent with prisoners awaiting their execution makes him realize how inhumane it is to prepare another human to die. After decades of work, when Stevenson fails to prevent the execution of a man who suffers from an intellectual disability, he momentarily feels unable to continue his work. However, he realizes that he cannot help but be broken by his experiences and comes to understand that it is his own brokenness that allows him to more fully understand the need for mercy and to bring compassion to others. The book ends with Stevenson’s renewed commitment to helping others."
Gulf,"The Old Man and the Sea is the story of an epic struggle between an old, seasoned fisherman and the greatest catch of his life. For eighty-four days, Santiago, an aged Cuban fisherman, has set out to sea and returned empty-handed. So conspicuously unlucky is he that the parents of his young, devoted apprentice and friend, Manolin, have forced the boy to leave the old man in order to fish in a more prosperous boat. Nevertheless, the boy continues to care for the old man upon his return each night. He helps the old man tote his gear to his ramshackle hut, secures food for him, and discusses the latest developments in American baseball, especially the trials of the old man’s hero, Joe DiMaggio. Santiago is confident that his unproductive streak will soon come to an end, and he resolves to sail out farther than usual the following day.
On the eighty-fifth day of his unlucky streak, Santiago does as promised, sailing his skiff far beyond the island’s shallow coastal waters and venturing into the Gulf Stream. He prepares his lines and drops them. At noon, a big fish, which he knows is a marlin, takes the bait that Santiago has placed one hundred fathoms deep in the waters. The old man expertly hooks the fish, but he cannot pull it in. Instead, the fish begins to pull the boat.
Unable to tie the line fast to the boat for fear the fish would snap a taut line, the old man bears the strain of the line with his shoulders, back, and hands, ready to give slack should the marlin make a run. The fish pulls the boat all through the day, through the night, through another day, and through another night. It swims steadily northwest until at last it tires and swims east with the current. The entire time, Santiago endures constant pain from the fishing line. Whenever the fish lunges, leaps, or makes a dash for freedom, the cord cuts Santiago badly. Although wounded and weary, the old man feels a deep empathy and admiration for the marlin, his brother in suffering, strength, and resolve.
On the third day the fish tires, and Santiago, sleep-deprived, aching, and nearly delirious, manages to pull the marlin in close enough to kill it with a harpoon thrust. Dead beside the skiff, the marlin is the largest Santiago has ever seen. He lashes it to his boat, raises the small mast, and sets sail for home. While Santiago is excited by the price that the marlin will bring at market, he is more concerned that the people who will eat the fish are unworthy of its greatness.
As Santiago sails on with the fish, the marlin’s blood leaves a trail in the water and attracts sharks. The first to attack is a great mako shark, which Santiago manages to slay with the harpoon. In the struggle, the old man loses the harpoon and lengths of valuable rope, which leaves him vulnerable to other shark attacks. The old man fights off the successive vicious predators as best he can, stabbing at them with a crude spear he makes by lashing a knife to an oar, and even clubbing them with the boat’s tiller. Although he kills several sharks, more and more appear, and by the time night falls, Santiago’s continued fight against the scavengers is useless. They devour the marlin’s precious meat, leaving only skeleton, head, and tail. Santiago chastises himself for going “out too far,” and for sacrificing his great and worthy opponent. He arrives home before daybreak, stumbles back to his shack, and sleeps very deeply.
The next morning, a crowd of amazed fishermen gathers around the skeletal carcass of the fish, which is still lashed to the boat. Knowing nothing of the old man’s struggle, tourists at a nearby café observe the remains of the giant marlin and mistake it for a shark. Manolin, who has been worried sick over the old man’s absence, is moved to tears when he finds Santiago safe in his bed. The boy fetches the old man some coffee and the daily papers with the baseball scores, and watches him sleep. When the old man wakes, the two agree to fish as partners once more. The old man returns to sleep and dreams his usual dream of lions at play on the beaches of Africa."
Heights,"In the late winter months of 1801, a man named Lockwood rents a manor house called Thrushcross Grange in the isolated moor country of England. Here, he meets his dour landlord, Heathcliff, a wealthy man who lives in the ancient manor of Wuthering Heights, four miles away from the Grange. In this wild, stormy countryside, Lockwood asks his housekeeper, Nelly Dean, to tell him the story of Heathcliff and the strange denizens of Wuthering Heights. Nelly consents, and Lockwood writes down his recollections of her tale in his diary; these written recollections form the main part of Wuthering Heights.
Nelly remembers her childhood. As a young girl, she works as a servant at Wuthering Heights for the owner of the manor, Mr. Earnshaw, and his family. One day, Mr. Earnshaw goes to Liverpool and returns home with an orphan boy whom he will raise with his own children. At first, the Earnshaw children—a boy named Hindley and his younger sister Catherine—detest the dark-skinned Heathcliff. But Catherine quickly comes to love him, and the two soon grow inseparable, spending their days playing on the moors. After his wife’s death, Mr. Earnshaw grows to prefer Heathcliff to his own son, and when Hindley continues his cruelty to Heathcliff, Mr. Earnshaw sends Hindley away to college, keeping Heathcliff nearby.
Three years later, Mr. Earnshaw dies, and Hindley inherits Wuthering Heights. He returns with a wife, Frances, and immediately seeks revenge on Heathcliff. Once an orphan, later a pampered and favored son, Heathcliff now finds himself treated as a common laborer, forced to work in the fields. Heathcliff continues his close relationship with Catherine, however. One night they wander to Thrushcross Grange, hoping to tease Edgar and Isabella Linton, the cowardly, snobbish children who live there. Catherine is bitten by a dog and is forced to stay at the Grange to recuperate for five weeks, during which time Mrs. Linton works to make her a proper young lady. By the time Catherine returns, she has become infatuated with Edgar, and her relationship with Heathcliff grows more complicated.
When Frances dies after giving birth to a baby boy named Hareton, Hindley descends into the depths of alcoholism, and behaves even more cruelly and abusively toward Heathcliff. Eventually, Catherine’s desire for social advancement prompts her to become engaged to Edgar Linton, despite her overpowering love for Heathcliff. Heathcliff runs away from Wuthering Heights, staying away for three years, and returning shortly after Catherine and Edgar’s marriage.
When Heathcliff returns, he immediately sets about seeking revenge on all who have wronged him. Having come into a vast and mysterious wealth, he deviously lends money to the drunken Hindley, knowing that Hindley will increase his debts and fall into deeper despondency. When Hindley dies, Heathcliff inherits the manor. He also places himself in line to inherit Thrushcross Grange by marrying Isabella Linton, whom he treats very cruelly. Catherine becomes ill, gives birth to a daughter, and dies. Heathcliff begs her spirit to remain on Earth—she may take whatever form she will, she may haunt him, drive him mad—just as long as she does not leave him alone. Shortly thereafter, Isabella flees to London and gives birth to Heathcliff’s son, named Linton after her family. She keeps the boy with her there.
Thirteen years pass, during which Nelly Dean serves as Catherine’s daughter’s nursemaid at Thrushcross Grange. Young Cathy is beautiful and headstrong like her mother, but her temperament is modified by her father’s gentler influence. Cathy grows up at the Grange with no knowledge of Wuthering Heights; one day, however, wandering through the moors, she discovers the manor, meets Hareton, and plays together with him. Soon afterwards, Isabella dies, and Linton comes to live with Heathcliff. Heathcliff treats his sickly, whining son even more cruelly than he treated the boy’s mother.
Three years later, Cathy meets Heathcliff on the moors, and makes a visit to Wuthering Heights to meet Linton. She and Linton begin a secret romance conducted entirely through letters. When Nelly destroys Cathy's collection of letters, the girl begins sneaking out at night to spend time with her frail young lover, who asks her to come back and nurse him back to health. However, it quickly becomes apparent that Linton is pursuing Cathy only because Heathcliff is forcing him to; Heathcliff hopes that if Cathy marries Linton, his legal claim upon Thrushcross Grange—and his revenge upon Edgar Linton—will be complete.
One day, as Edgar Linton grows ill and nears death, Heathcliff lures Nelly and Cathy back to Wuthering Heights, and holds them prisoner until Cathy marries Linton. Soon after the marriage, Edgar dies, and his death is quickly followed by the death of the sickly Linton. Heathcliff now controls both Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange. He forces Cathy to live at Wuthering Heights and act as a common servant, while he rents Thrushcross Grange to Lockwood.
Nelly’s story ends as she reaches the present. Lockwood, appalled, ends his tenancy at Thrushcross Grange and returns to London. However, six months later, he pays a visit to Nelly, and learns of further developments in the story. Although Cathy originally mocked Hareton’s ignorance and illiteracy (in an act of retribution, Heathcliff ended Hareton’s education after Hindley died), Cathy grows to love Hareton as they live together at Wuthering Heights. Heathcliff becomes more and more obsessed with the memory of the elder Catherine, to the extent that he begins speaking to her ghost. Everything he sees reminds him of her. Shortly after a night spent walking on the moors, Heathcliff dies. Hareton and Cathy inherit Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange, and they plan to be married on the next New Year’s Day. After hearing the end of the story, Lockwood goes to visit the graves of Catherine and Heathcliff.
Chronology
The story of Wuthering Heights is told through flashbacks recorded in diary entries, and events are often presented out of chronological order—Lockwood’s narrative takes place after Nelly’s narrative, for instance, but is interspersed with Nelly’s story in his journal. Nevertheless, the novel contains enough clues to enable an approximate reconstruction of its chronology, which was elaborately designed by Emily Brontë. For instance, Lockwood’s diary entries are recorded in the late months of 1801 and in September 1802; in 1801, Nelly tells Lockwood that she has lived at Thrushcross Grange for eighteen years, since Catherine’s marriage to Edgar, which must then have occurred in 1783.
We know that Catherine was engaged to Edgar for three years, and that Nelly was twenty-two when they were engaged, so the engagement must have taken place in 1780, and Nelly must have been born in 1758. Since Nelly is a few years older than Catherine, and since Lockwood comments that Heathcliff is about forty years old in 1801, it stands to reason that Heathcliff and Catherine were born around 1761, three years after Nelly. There are several other clues like this in the novel (such as Hareton’s birth, which occurs in June, 1778). The following chronology is based on those clues, and should closely approximate the timing of the novel’s important events. A “~” before a date indicates that it cannot be precisely determined from the evidence in the novel, but only closely estimated.
1500: The stone above the front door of Wuthering Heights, bearing the name of Hareton Earnshaw, is inscribed, possibly to mark the completion of the house.
1758: Nelly is born.
~1761: Heathcliff and Catherine are born.
~1767: Mr. Earnshaw brings Heathcliff to live at Wuthering Heights. 
1774: Mr. Earnshaw sends Hindley away to college.
1777: Mr. Earnshaw dies; Hindley and Frances take possession of Wuthering Heights; Catherine first visits Thrushcross Grange around Christmastime.
1778: Hareton is born in June; Frances dies; Hindley begins his slide into alcoholism.
1780: Catherine becomes engaged to Edgar Linton; Heathcliff leaves Wuthering Heights.
1783: Catherine and Edgar are married; Heathcliff arrives at Thrushcross Grange in September.
1784: Heathcliff and Isabella elope in the early part of the year; Catherine becomes ill with brain fever; her daughter Cathy is born late in the year; Catherine dies.
1785: Early in the year, Isabella flees Wuthering Heights and settles in London; Linton is born.
~1785: Hindley dies; Heathcliff inherits Wuthering Heights.
~1797: Young Cathy meets Hareton and visits Wuthering Heights for the first time; Linton comes from London after Isabella dies (in late 1797 or early 1798).
1800: Cathy stages her romance with Linton in the winter.
1801: Early in the year, Cathy is imprisoned by Heathcliff and forced to marry Linton; Edgar Linton dies; Linton dies; Heathcliff assumes control of Thrushcross Grange. Late in the year, Lockwood rents the Grange from Heathcliff and begins his tenancy. In a winter storm, Lockwood takes ill and begins conversing with Nelly Dean.
1801-1802: During the winter, Nelly narrates her story for Lockwood.
1802: In spring, Lockwood returns to London; Cathy and Hareton fall in love; Heathcliff dies; Lockwood returns in September and hears the end of the story from Nelly.
1803: On New Year’s Day, Cathy and Hareton plan to be married."
Unbounded,"Demian presents the reflections of an older man on his childhood. In this book, Emil Sinclair recounts the various episodes of his childhood that led to a profound change in his Weltanschauung or worldview. Interspersed in and among these tales are Sinclair's recollections of what he was thinking at the time in question and some analysis of why he acted as he did in any given situation.
The first episode occurs when Sinclair is ten years old. Sinclair invents a story about stealing some apples and is then blackmailed by an eleven year old thug, Franz Kromer. Not having enough money to pay off Kromer, Sinclair begins to steal and is otherwise subjected to tormenting humiliation by Kromer. A slightly older, but amazingly mature boy, Max Demian, soon enters Sinclair's school. He approaches Sinclair one day after class and presents him with an inventive interpretation of the story of Cain and Abel. This interpretation contradicts the standard Christian story Sinclair has been fed and the new idea excites Sinclair. Seemingly knowing everything, and with unbounded capability, Demian convinces Kromer to stop tormenting Sinclair. Freed from the source of his tensions, Sinclair abandons Demian and attempts to become a more model child.
After a number of years of only peripheral contact, Sinclair and Demian are reunited in a confirmation class. Though they do not spend much time together at first, their relationship is rekindled after the teacher discusses Cain and Abel in class one day. Demian switches his seat to be next to Sinclair and they spend much time discussing the will and exploring Demian's uncanny ability to affect how other people act. During this time, Sinclair's religious faith begins to wane. Demian presents him with the thought that worshipping the God of the Bible is not sufficient. The God of the Bible represents all that is sanctified and good in the world, but, Demian insists, one ought to worship the entire world—the evil parts too. Sinclair is elated that Demian has touched on these thoughts—that the world is divided in two realms—light and darkness, good and bad.
Sinclair enters boarding school, confused and unsure of what he thinks and believes. One day he is approached by an older boy, Alfons Beck, who invites him to a bar. They go off together, drink wine, and chat. This marks the beginning of a rebellious streak and a new group of friends for young Sinclair. He often goes out late into the night, drinking and carousing. However, he refrains from one of the activities popular among his friends: he refuses to go with them when they visit women because Sinclair has a yearning for love, not sex. One day in the park, Sinclair sees a girl who is, for him, the paradigm of beauty. She has some male features, but is surrounded by an incredibly alluring air. Though he never speaks to her, he names her Beatrice, and she becomes a symbol for him, an ideal for whom he acts. Immediately he reforms his behavior and ceases his activities with his friends. Also, he begins to take up painting and paints a picture of this girl. Days later he realizes that the picture is also a picture of Demian.
In class one day, Sinclair finds a note that speaks about breaking free. Also, it mentions a god, Abraxas. Sinclair is certain that the note is from Demian. Only half paying attention to the day's lecture, Sinclair perks up when he hears his teacher mention Abraxas. The teacher says that Abraxas is an ancient God who contains both divine and satanic elements.
Strolling about town one day, Sinclair hears music emanating from a small, locked church. He is moved by it and sits outside to listen for a while. He does this many times and eventually decides to trail the organist as he leaves after playing on one occasion. Sinclair follows him to a bar and sits beside him. They begin to chat and Sinclair mentions Abraxas. At once, the organist, Pistorius, takes a great interest in Sinclair. This is the start of an intense relationship between the two men. Pistorius becomes a mentor to Sinclair, helping him to learn further things about himself and teaching him a bit about Abraxas.
Knauer, a classmate of Sinclair, approaches him after school one day, seeking guidance. Sinclair feels that he has very little to offer to the boy. Sinclair tells him only that he needs to learn to be comfortable with what his innermost soul wants. Later, out for a stroll one restless night, Sinclair comes across Knauer, who is ready to commit suicide. He saves Knauer, for which Knauer later displays much gratitude and allegiance.
Sinclair begins to see that Pistorius has limitations. He tells Pistorius that he is too ""antiquarian."" He brings Pistorius to recognize that he can only teach Sinclair about old gods and ideas of the past—he is not creative enough to invent new ones. Their relationship ends as Sinclair ends his time at preparatory school. Before entering university, Sinclair visits Demian's old house. There, the new owner shows him a picture of Demian's mother. Sinclair realizes that she looks exactly like the portraits he has been drawing, and he unsuccessfully searches for her.
Strolling around his college town one evening, Sinclair runs into Demian and they are happily reunited. Demian tells Sinclair that his mother will be very excited to see him; he tells him to come by whenever he is ready to see her. The next day, an excited Sinclair goes to the Demian household. He and Frau Eva bond at once. They speak of the long journey he has undergone to arrive at this point.
Sinclair soon becomes a regular in the Demian household. He is immensely happy to be spending his time with Demian, Demian's mother, and others of their type who pass through. There is, however, a note of darkness—both Demian and Sinclair have premonitions of evil to come. Talk about a war begins to brew. Sinclair spends that summer with the Demian family, further strengthening his bond with both Demian and Frau Eva. One day he summons his mental energy to telepathically call Frau Eva. She hears his call and sends Demian to him. Sinclair is ecstatic that it works.
War begins and Demian is called to serve as a lieutenant. Before Sinclair goes off to war, Eva tells him that he now knows how to call her and whenever he needs to, he can do so and she will send somebody like her to his side.
Sinclair is wounded in battle. He summons his energy and finds Demian by his side one night in the infirmary. Demian tells Sinclair that if he ever feels like he needs help, he no longer needs to call Demian. He simply needs to look inside himself and he will see that Demian is within him. With that, Demian gives him a light kiss on the lips—a kiss that he says is from Frau Eva—and vanishes into the night."
Expressly,"Hercule Poirot, private detective and retired Belgian police officer, boards the Taurus Express train to Stamboul (Istanbul). On the train there are two other passengers, Mary Debenham and Colonel Arbuthnot. The two act as if they are strangers, but Poirot observes behavior that suggests that they are not. Poirot is suspicious of the couple. The train arrives in Stamboul and Poirot checks in at the Tokatlian Hotel. As soon as Poirot arrives he receives a telegram summoning him back to London. While waiting at the hotel for the next train, Poirot bumps into an old friend, M. Bouc, head of the Wagon Lit. M. Bouc arranges a space for Poirot on the Orient Express. In the dining room of the Tokatlian Hotel, Poirot first spots Ratchett and Hector McQueen eating dinner. Poirot know that Ratchett is an evil man and he describes him to M. Bouc as an animal.
Poirot board the Orient Express. He is forced to ride in a second-class cabin because the train is unusually full. Ratchett and Hector McQueen are also aboard the train. Ratchett approaches Poirot and asks if he will work for him, Ratchett tells Poirot he has been receiving threatening letters and that someone is trying to kill him. Poirot refuses the case. M. Bouc has taken the last first class cabin, but arranges to be moved to a separate coach and gives Poirot his space in first class. The first night Poirot sleeps in first class, he observes some strange occurrences. Early in the morning, Poirot is wakened by a cry from Ratchett's compartment next to him. The wagon lit conductor responds knocks on Ratchett's door and a voice from inside responds, ""Ce n'est rien. Je me suis trompe"" (It is nothing. I am mistaken). Poirot has difficulty sleeping because there is a peculiar silence on the train. Mrs. Hubbard rings her bell and tells the conductor a man is in her room. Poirot rings his bell for water and is informed by the conductor that the train is stuck in a snow bank. Poirot hears a loud thump next door.
The next morning, the train still stopped, M. Bouc informs Poirot that Ratchett has been murdered and the murderer is still aboard the train. Poirot tells M. Bouc he will investigate the case. Poirot first examines Ratchett's body and compartment. Ratchett has twelve stab wounds. The window is left open in Ratchett's compartment, presumably to make the investigators think the murderer escaped out the window, but there are no footprints outside the window in the snow. A handkerchief with the initial ""H"" is found in the compartment, a pipe cleaner, a round match different from the matches Ratchett used and a charred piece of paper with the name ""Armstrong"" on it.
The piece of paper with the word Armstrong on it helps Poirot figure out who Ratchett really is and why someone would want to murder him. A few years back, a man named Cassetti kidnapped a three-year old girl, Daisy Armstrong. Cassetti collected a ransom from the wealthy Armstrong family, but killed the child anyways. Poirot concludes that Ratchett is Cassetti.
The interviews start with the Wagon Lit conductor, then Hector McQueen. Poirot knows that McQueen is involved with the case because he knows about the Armstrong note found in Ratchett's compartment, Hector is surprised that Poirot found the note because he thought it had been completely destroyed. He interviews Masterman and then Mrs. Hubbard. Mrs. Hubbard claims that the murderer was in her cabin. All of the passengers give Poirot suitable alibis during their interviews, although a few suspicious elements are brought to light: many passengers observed a woman in a red kimono walking down the hallway the night of the murder, but no one admits they have a red kimono. Mrs. Hubbard tells Poirot she had Greta Ohlsson lock the communicating door between she and Ratchett. Hildegarde Schmidt bumped into a stranger wearing a Wagon Lit jacket.
Poirot checks every passenger's luggage. During the check he notices a few interesting things: the label on Countess Andrenyi's luggage is wet, a Wagon Lit uniform is found in Hildegarde Schmidt's bag and, lastly, the red kimono is found in Poirot's own luggage.
After the luggage check, Poirot, Dr. Constantine and M. Bouc review the facts of the case and develop a list of questions. With the evidence and questions in mind, Poirot sits and thinks about the case. When he surfaces from a somewhat trance-like state, Poirot has discovered the solution to the case. Before he reveals this solution in full, he calls in several people and reveals their true identities. Poirot discovers Countess Andrenyi is Helena Goldenberg, aunt of Daisy Armstrong. She wet her luggage label and obscured her name, in an effort to conceal her identity. Also, Mary Debenham was Daisy's governess, Antonio Foscanelli was the Armstrong's chaffer, Masterman the valet, and Greta Ohlsson was Daisy Armstrong's nurse. Princess Dragomiroff claims her handkerchief from Poirot, the same found in Ratchett's compartment.
Poirot gathers all of the passengers into the dining car and propounds two possible solutions. The fist solution is that a stranger entered the train at Vincovci and killed Ratchett. The second solution is that all of the passengers aboard the Orient Express were involved with the murder. He argues that twelve of the thirteen passengers, all close to the Armstrong case, killed Ratchett to avenge the murder of Daisy Armstrong. Mrs. Hubbard, revealed as Linda Arden, admits that the second solution is correct. Poirot suggests that M. Bouc and Dr. Constantine tell the police that the first solution is correct to protect the family. M. Bouc and Dr. Constantine accept Poirot's suggestion."
Conceived,"In Born a Crime: Stories from a South African Childhood, comedian and television personality Trevor Noah gives a heartfelt and funny recounting of his experiences growing up in South Africa as an oppressed person. Stories of Noah’s life are interspersed with insights into South Africa’s culture, systems, and history. Noah was born in 1984 to a single mother, Patricia, during the time of racial segregation known as apartheid. Patricia was a strong, driven woman who paid little heed to the racist laws that oppressed her. Noah’s father, Robert, agreed to give Patricia a child during a time when sexual relationships between black and white South Africans were illegal. Robert, a Swiss immigrant, never supported segregation and did what he could to undermine apartheid. Because it was dangerous for Patricia and Robert to be seen with their mixed-race child, Noah recalls sometimes being momentarily abandoned by his parents in public settings.
Dutch colonizers came to South Africa in the 1600s and used slave labor to run their farms on stolen land. The white South Africans called Afrikaners are descended from these colonizers. Black South Africans, from tribes including the Zulu, Xhosa, and Sotho tribes, were subjugated under apartheid law until the mid-1990s. A third racial group emerged from the intermingling of the Black and white South Africans: mixed-race or “colored.” Both during apartheid and after its dissolution, mixed-race South Africans were the most marginalized and disenfranchised people. Noah often felt defined by what he wasn’t: not light enough to be labeled as white and not dark enough to be fully accepted into Black culture.
Apartheid ended in 1994, but Noah’s struggles as a mixed-race child in South Africa continued. It was often hard for Noah to determine which groups would accept him. Patricia had always encouraged her son to read and think independently; she valued education and made sure that her son spoke multiple languages. Of the eleven official languages in South Africa, Noah could speak Zulu, Tsonga, English, and Afrikaans. This skill allowed him to move among different racial and cultural groups at school. Though Noah felt out of place in many social settings, his ability to talk and empathize with many different types of people served him well throughout his life. Even at a young age, Noah understood that the bullying he experienced from his mixed-race peers was likely a result of the self-hatred all mixed-race South Africans had been taught. Noah was a mischievous child, but Patricia believed in tempering her punishments with assurances to her son that she held him accountable because she loved him. Patricia knew that the world would not always be kind and generous to Noah, and she wanted to prepare him well.
During his high school years, Noah acquired a small bootleg CD business from a friend. Noah soon found that he could make more money working with his friend Sizwe, who was from the poorer, crowded Johannesburg township called Alexandra—known to most residents as Alex. After graduation Noah moved to Alex to expand his profits, with Sizwe’s help. Sizwe recognized that Noah had talent as a live DJ, and the pair formed a performance group. Noah and his group sold bootleg and mixed CDs, dealt in stolen goods, performed at parties and concerts, and did their best to avoid confrontations with local law enforcement. Noah was already familiar with the South African police. Patricia received no help from the local police when she tried to file charges against her abusive husband. Noah was arrested for shoplifting, on suspicion of carrying a weapon, and for driving an unregistered vehicle. One arrest kept Noah in jail for several days, and Patricia had to pay for his lawyer. Despite his dealings with law enforcement, Noah could see his own privilege in comparison to many of his peers. Patricia had worked hard to make sure her son had the ability to make a life for himself.
The men in Noah’s life taught him little about how to interact with women. Robert was a distant but generally pleasant presence. Patricia’s father, Temperance Noah, was an unpredictable figure. Later, Noah would learn that his grandfather had bipolar disorder and would often beat his wife, Frances. Patricia experienced abuse in her marriage as well. Noah’s stepfather, Abel, became acquainted with Patricia and her young son during their many visits to the automotive shop where Abel worked on their run-down car. After Abel and Patricia married, he bought the shop. Patricia was forced to sell her home to keep the business running, and the family spent a stressful year living in the shop warehouse. Abel often came home drunk, and he began beating his wife. Once Abel had sons of his own, Noah’s half-brothers Andrew and Isaac, Abel’s hostility toward Patricia’s oldest son grew. When Patricia learned that her violent husband had bought a gun, she helped Noah move out on his own. 
One day, Noah received a phone call from Andrew with news that Abel, now estranged from his family, had come to Patricia’s new house and shot her in the head as she was shielding Andrew and Isaac. Miraculously, Patricia survived. Noah was able to cover her medical bills, and Patricia thanked God for protecting her and giving her a son who could afford to help her."
Executions,"Lawyer Bryan Stevenson gives a first-person account of his decades helping marginalized Americans who have been unfairly and harshly punished by the U.S. criminal justice system, which disproportionately targets people of color and poor people. At the heart of Just Mercy is the story of Walter McMillian, a Black man who was framed for the murder of a girl named Ronda Morrison, convicted, and sent to death row. 
Stevenson alternates chapters about Walter with his personal reflections on our country’s history with racial disparity and issues around incarceration. Stevenson highlights other groups of vulnerable people who have been victimized by the criminal justice system and shares the stories of the prisoners he has helped over the years. The book also follows the growth of Stevenson’s nonprofit law project, the Alabama-based Equal Justice Initiative (EJI), through its expansion from focusing on death row prisoners to helping people sentenced to life without parole. Stevenson chronicles how EJI becomes a significant force in criminal justice reform.
In 1983 as a law student, Stevenson discovers his life’s passion when he interns with the Georgia-based Southern Prisoners Defense Committee and meets his first death row prisoner. After graduation Stevenson accepts a job with the organization to represent poor prisoners, including those in Alabama who lack any public defender. He meets Walter McMillian on Alabama’s death row. Walter owns a successful business but also transgresses racial boundaries when he has an affair with a white woman. Soon after the affair becomes public, the woman’s friend, Ralph Myers, accuses Walter of committing the unsolved murder of Ronda Morrison, which has outraged the community. Law enforcement, including a racist sheriff and the district attorney, eagerly pounces on this accusation, overlooking Walter’s alibi and a lack of evidence. Instead, they actively force Ralph to stick with his story even when he tries to recant. They coerce other false witness testimonies, and—as revealed years later—actively suppress evidence.
After Stevenson and the team at EJI unsuccessfully appeal Walter’s conviction, they launch their own investigation of the crime and uncover new evidence. They find witnesses who can prove the witnesses against Walter lied as well as financial records that indicate that one of these witnesses was paid to give false testimony. Stevenson and his team also petition for and receive all records from Walter’s trial. However, their big break comes when they receive a phone call from Ralph, who now wants to make amends. Ralph admits to lying about Walter and says he was threatened by law enforcement. Stevenson wins a hearing for Walter where he can present his new evidence: Ralph’s testimony, which is confirmed by health care workers and other inmates, as well as recordings of the law enforcement team threatening Ralph if he doesn’t frame Walter. 
While the judge refuses to grant Walter relief, Stevenson continues the appeal process through the Alabama courts. The district attorney asks outside agents to investigate the murder for which Walter was convicted, and the investigators determine that Walter had nothing to do with the crime. Six weeks later, the court invalidates Walter’s conviction. Stevenson and the State file a joint motion to dismiss the charges, and Walter is set free.
Throughout the process, Stevenson and Walter become close friends, and Stevenson helps Walter upon his release, including filing a civil suit on his behalf and offering him a place to stay. Walter works with Stevenson to share his story, giving interviews and speaking at legal conferences, and Walter is even featured in a documentary. Unfortunately, Walter is diagnosed with advancing dementia and is forced to rely on family and eventually a nursing facility for his care. He dies in 2013. Stevenson gives a eulogy at his funeral and shares all he learned from Walter, particularly that we must extend mercy to everyone, even those who have not earned it.
Interspersed with chapters chronicling Walter’s narrative are stories of Stevenson’s other clients and work. His closeness with these prisoners and their horrifying circumstances makes Stevenson more determined to help and causes him to reflect on abstract issues that nevertheless imbue the criminal justice system, like humanity and mercy. Stevenson focuses on several categories of vulnerable people who become trapped in the system, including mentally ill prisoners, disabled prisoners, and poor women who give birth to stillborn babies. 
Stevenson and his team at EJI also become increasingly focused on juvenile offenders who are sometimes tried as adults despite their young age. These offenders may be given de facto death sentences by being sentenced to life without parole and face perilous circumstances when they are housed in adult prisons. Stevenson illustrates how these prisoners retain their own humanity while being forced to live under inhumane conditions. He also discusses some of the qualities common among these types of prisoners: They are generally poor and disproportionately people of color, and most of them lack adequate legal counsel. The juveniles have horrific backgrounds of abuse and neglect.
Stevenson and his team at EJI also work to change the legal system to offer more protection to marginalized people. Several of his cases end up before the U.S. Supreme Court, and he succeeds in winning rulings that ban as unconstitutional the conviction of children to life without parole and the execution of people deemed incompetent from dementia or neurological disease. EJI works to raise public awareness of issues surrounding unfair incarceration, produces groundbreaking reports on racial issues, and sets up programs to help formerly incarcerated people adjust to life on the outside.
Stevenson also reflects on the issues that surround the criminal justice system. His time spent with prisoners awaiting their execution makes him realize how inhumane it is to prepare another human to die. After decades of work, when Stevenson fails to prevent the execution of a man who suffers from an intellectual disability, he momentarily feels unable to continue his work. However, he realizes that he cannot help but be broken by his experiences and comes to understand that it is his own brokenness that allows him to more fully understand the need for mercy and to bring compassion to others. The book ends with Stevenson’s renewed commitment to helping others."
Won,"Part One of Wonder is told from August “Auggie” Pullman’s point of view. Auggie was born with a genetic syndrome that gives him tiny ears, low eyes, and a misshapen mouth and jaw. By the time he is twelve, he has endured twenty-seven surgeries. Auggie lives in New York City with his parents, his sister, Olivia or “Via,” and his dog, Daisy, and until the novel begins, he has been homeschooled. 
Mom wants Auggie to go to middle school, but Dad feels hesitant, worried the other students will be cruel. Mom takes Auggie to meet Beecher Prep’s principal, Mr. Tushman, who has arranged for three other students—Jack, Charlotte, and Julian—to give Auggie a tour of the school. On the first day of school, Auggie faces a barrage of shocked reactions and surprised looks as people react to his appearance for the first time. Julian teases and provokes Auggie. Mr. Browne, their English teacher, gives his students a precept every month to think and write about. The first precept is about kindness. Auggie becomes good friends with Jack and a girl named Summer who sits with Auggie at lunch of her own volition. However, on Halloween, Auggie overhears Jack telling others that he wishes Auggie would stop following him around. Hurt and rejected, Auggie questions whether he should be in school at all.
Part Two is told from Via’s point of view. Since Auggie’s birth when she was four, she has had to be independent and take a back seat to Auggie’s needs. After Via returns from spending a few weeks with her grandmother, she sees Auggie as others see him for the first time. As Via enters high school, she feels estranged from her former best friends, Ella and Miranda. Miranda has also been a good friend to Auggie and gave him the astronaut helmet that he wore for several years. Auggie confides to Via what he overheard Jack say on Halloween, and they agree school is hard for everyone, but Via encourages Auggie to “suck it up.”
In Part Three, which is told from Summer’s point of view, Summer explains that she chooses to be Auggie’s friend despite criticism from other students. They work on an Egyptian Museum project at her house, where Auggie learns more about Summer’s personal life, including the fact that her father died. Auggie and Summer talk about death and agree that maybe people get to come back with new faces. They talk openly about Auggie’s appearance. When Jack later asks Summer why Auggie is upset with him, she gives him a hint but isn’t explicit.
Part Four is told by Jack. He recalls the day when he gave Auggie the tour of the school but also recalls having seen him outside an ice cream shop before. He is used to Auggie’s face and genuinely likes him as a friend. One day, Jack has an epiphany and finally understands what Summer’s hint meant and why Auggie has been upset with him. Jack feels guilty that he lied to others about his feelings about Auggie. When Julian calls Auggie a “freak,” Jack punches him in the mouth, but he will not tell Mr. Tushman why. Mr. Tushman sends Jack home until after winter break as punishment. Through Facebook messages, Jack apologizes to Auggie, and the boys are friends again. Julian’s mother tells Mr. Tushman that Auggie doesn’t belong at Beecher Prep, but Mr. Tushman disagrees. After the break, Charlotte describes the students who are on Julian’s side, on Auggie’s side, and neutral. Jack goes to Auggie’s house to work on a science fair project. He meets Via and realizes that she knows about what happened on Halloween. Via introduces Auggie and Jack to her boyfriend, Justin.
Part Five is told by Justin. Although he’s unsettled when he meets Auggie, he likes Via and her family very much, especially compared to his parents, who are divorced and rather absent. At school, Justin is cast as the lead in Our Town, and Via has a small part and serves as an understudy for Miranda, who has been cast as Emily, the female lead. When Justin witnesses Julian and others teasing Jack one day, he tells the boys to leave Jack alone. He learns that Miranda and Via were once close friends, and Via confesses that she hasn't told her parents about the play because she doesn’t want them to bring Auggie. She is ashamed that she feels embarrassed by her brother.
In Part Six, Auggie’s point of view returns. He cringes through the science fair because so many people react to seeing him for the first time. Julian puts mean notes in Auggie’s and Jack’s lockers, but Auggie notices that students are accepting him more. When Auggie gets hearing aids, life improves dramatically. However, when he learns that Via doesn’t want him to go to her play, he angrily explodes. Meanwhile, Daisy must be euthanized, which saddens the whole Pullman family, but ultimately draws them closer together and assuages the discord between Auggie and Via. Auggie attends Via’s play with his parents, and they are delighted when they see her playing the lead. Via and Justin get standing ovations.
Part Seven is told by Miranda. In the summer before high school, at camp, she lies and tells people that she has a brother with a deformed face, which increases her popularity. Miranda’s parents are divorced and distant, but she feels safe with Via’s loving family. However, Miranda changes that summer, both in appearance and in attitude. She is cast as the lead in Our Town, but on opening night, when she sees Auggie in the audience and realizes that no one has come to see her, she pretends to be sick so that Via can play the lead. After the play, Miranda sees Auggie backstage, and they hug. The Pullmans invite her to join them for dinner, and she happily accepts.
Part Eight returns to Auggie’s point of view. When his class, minus Julian, goes to the Broarwood Nature Retreat for three days, he feels both excited and afraid. He has a vision of Daisy on his first morning and enjoys nature walks and campfires and horseback riding. On movie night, when Jack has to use the bathroom, Auggie goes with him. In the woods, they meet a group of seventh graders who say awful things to Auggie. A fight breaks out. Jack and several other boys defend and protect Auggie. Auggie gets hurt and loses his hearing aids. 
When Mom picks him up the next day, Auggie says that he had a great time except for the last night. Dad brings home a new puppy. Back at school, Auggie has become a hero along with Jack and the other boys who defended him in the woods. Julian has become irrelevant, and Auggie learns that Julian won’t return to Beecher Prep the following year. When Dad drops Auggie off for his fifth-grade graduation, Dad admits that he is the one who threw away Auggie’s space helmet years ago. Auggie feels angry but forgives him. During the ceremony, Auggie wins the Henry Ward Beecher Award for his strength and kindness and receives a standing ovation. As the Pullmans walk home, Auggie thanks his mother for sending him to school, and his mother thanks him for being such a wonder."
Fraud,"In the Puritan New England town of Salem, Massachusetts, a group of girls goes dancing in the forest with a black slave named Tituba. While dancing, they are caught by the local minister, Reverend Parris. One of the girls, Parris’s daughter Betty, falls into a coma-like state. A crowd gathers in the Parris home while rumors of witchcraft fill the town. Having sent for Reverend Hale, an expert on witchcraft, Parris questions Abigail Williams, the girls’ ringleader, about the events that took place in the forest. Abigail, who is Parris’s niece and ward, admits to doing nothing beyond “dancing.”
While Parris tries to calm the crowd that has gathered in his home, Abigail talks to some of the other girls, telling them not to admit to anything. John Proctor, a local farmer, then enters and talks to Abigail alone. Unbeknownst to anyone else in the town, while working in Proctor’s home the previous year she engaged in an affair with him, which led to her being fired by his wife, Elizabeth. Abigail still desires Proctor, but he fends her off and tells her to end her foolishness with the girls.
Betty wakes up and begins screaming. Much of the crowd rushes upstairs and gathers in her bedroom, arguing over whether she is bewitched. A separate argument between Proctor, Parris, the argumentative Giles Corey, and the wealthy Thomas Putnam soon ensues. This dispute centers on money and land deeds, and it suggests that deep fault lines run through the Salem community. As the men argue, Reverend Hale arrives and examines Betty, while Proctor departs. Hale quizzes Abigail about the girls’ activities in the forest, grows suspicious of her behavior, and demands to speak to Tituba. After Parris and Hale interrogate her for a brief time, Tituba confesses to communing with the devil, and she hysterically accuses various townsfolk of consorting with the devil. Suddenly, Abigail joins her, confessing to having seen the devil conspiring and cavorting with other townspeople. Betty joins them in naming witches, and the crowd is thrown into an uproar.
A week later, alone in their farmhouse outside of town, John and Elizabeth Proctor discuss the ongoing trials and the escalating number of townsfolk who have been accused of being witches. Elizabeth urges her husband to denounce Abigail as a fraud; he refuses, and she becomes jealous, accusing him of still harboring feelings for her. Mary Warren, their servant and one of Abigail’s circle, returns from Salem with news that Elizabeth has been accused of witchcraft but the court did not pursue the accusation. Mary is sent up to bed, and John and Elizabeth continue their argument, only to be interrupted by a visit from Reverend Hale. While they discuss matters, Giles Corey and Francis Nurse come to the Proctor home with news that their wives have been arrested. Officers of the court suddenly arrive and arrest Elizabeth. After they have taken her, Proctor browbeats Mary, insisting that she must go to Salem and expose Abigail and the other girls as frauds.
The next day, Proctor brings Mary to court and tells Judge Danforth that she will testify that the girls are lying. Danforth is suspicious of Proctor’s motives and tells Proctor, truthfully, that Elizabeth is pregnant and will be spared for a time. Proctor persists in his charge, convincing Danforth to allow Mary to testify. Mary tells the court that the girls are lying. When the girls are brought in, they turn the tables by accusing Mary of bewitching them. Furious, Proctor confesses his affair with Abigail and accuses her of being motivated by jealousy of his wife. To test Proctor’s claim, Danforth summons Elizabeth and asks her if Proctor has been unfaithful to her. Despite her natural honesty, she lies to protect Proctor’s honor, and Danforth denounces Proctor as a liar. Meanwhile, Abigail and the girls again pretend that Mary is bewitching them, and Mary breaks down and accuses Proctor of being a witch. Proctor rages against her and against the court. He is arrested, and Hale quits the proceedings.
The summer passes and autumn arrives. The witch trials have caused unrest in neighboring towns, and Danforth grows nervous. Abigail has run away, taking all of Parris’s money with her. Hale, who has lost faith in the court, begs the accused witches to confess falsely in order to save their lives, but they refuse. Danforth, however, has an idea: he asks Elizabeth to talk John into confessing, and she agrees. Conflicted, but desiring to live, John agrees to confess, and the officers of the court rejoice. But he refuses to incriminate anyone else, and when the court insists that the confession must be made public, Proctor grows angry, tears it up, and retracts his admission of guilt. Despite Hale’s desperate pleas, Proctor goes to the gallows with the others, and the witch trials reach their awful conclusion."

Subsequently,"A Raisin in the Sun portrays a few weeks in the life of the Youngers, a Black family living on the South Side of Chicago in the 1950s. When the play opens, the Youngers are about to receive an insurance check for $10,000. This money comes from the deceased Mr. Younger’s life insurance policy. Each of the adult members of the family has an idea as to what he or she would like to do with this money. The matriarch of the family, Mama, wants to buy a house to fulfill a dream she shared with her husband. Mama’s son, Walter Lee, would rather use the money to invest in a liquor store with his friends. He believes that the investment will solve the family’s financial problems forever. Walter’s wife, Ruth, agrees with Mama, however, and hopes that she and Walter can provide more space and opportunity for their son, Travis. Finally, Beneatha, Walter’s sister and Mama’s daughter, wants to use the money for her medical school tuition. She also wishes that her family members were not so interested in assimilating into the white world. Beneatha instead tries to find her identity by looking back to the past and to Africa.
As the play progresses, the Youngers clash over their competing dreams. Ruth discovers that she is pregnant but fears that if she has the child, she will put more financial pressure on her family members. When Walter says nothing to Ruth’s admission that she is considering abortion, Mama puts a down payment on a house for the whole family. She believes that a bigger, brighter dwelling will help them all. This house is in Clybourne Park, an entirely white neighborhood. When the Youngers’ future neighbors find out that the Youngers are moving in, they send Mr. Lindner, from the Clybourne Park Improvement Association, to offer the Youngers money in return for staying away. The Youngers refuse the deal, even after Walter loses the rest of the money ($6,500) to his friend Willy Harris, who persuades Walter to invest in the liquor store and then runs off with his cash.
In the meantime, Beneatha rejects her suitor, George Murchison, whom she believes to be shallow and blind to the problems of race. Subsequently, she receives a marriage proposal from her Nigerian boyfriend, Joseph Asagai, who wants Beneatha to get a medical degree and move to Africa with him (Beneatha does not make her choice before the end of the play). The Youngers eventually move out of the apartment, fulfilling the family’s long-held dream. Their future seems uncertain and slightly dangerous, but they are optimistic and determined to live a better life. They believe that they can succeed if they stick together as a family and resolve to defer their dreams no longer."
Periodically,"Irene Redfield is a light-skinned Black woman who, in public places, occasionally passes for white, when she finds it convenient. Irene is a practical, determined person. She was born and raised in Chicago but now lives in Harlem with her husband, Brian, and their two boys. Brian is a successful doctor but dislikes his work. He would have preferred to move the entire family to another, less racist country long ago, but Irene has always insisted that the family belongs in New York.
One day, while back in Chicago for a visit, Irene has a chance meeting with a childhood friend, Clare. Clare is very different from Irene—self-centered, melodramatic, and reckless. Clare is even lighter-skinned than Irene, and in fact she has married a white man, John Bellew, without telling him that she is Black. They have a daughter. The Bellews live mostly in Europe but often spend time in the Unites States, depending on where John Bellew’s work in international banking takes him. Irene finds Clare strangely fascinating but does not like her company. She only reluctantly agrees to visit Clare at the Bellews’ hotel suite. Clare has invited a mutual light-skinned friend of theirs to join them. When John Bellew arrives, Irene is shocked to learn that he is a vehement racist. He openly declares that he hates Black people, not knowing that he is speaking to three of them.
Two years later, the Bellews have relocated to New York. Clare resumes contact with Irene, and Irene is not firm enough to insist that Clare leave her alone, if only to keep Clare’s secret safe. When Clare learns that Irene is planning a charity event at which upper-class Black people and white people will mingle, Clare insists on attending. Soon, she is at the Redfields’ home regularly and has become part of their social circle. In time, Irene suspects that Clare and Brian are having an affair. The Bellews are due to move back to Europe soon, but a chance downtown encounter between John Bellew and Irene, while Irene is with a darker-skinned friend, creates a crisis. If Bellew deduces that Clare, like Irene, is Black, he may divorce Clare and leave her free to pursue Brian.
The threat that Clare poses for Irene’s marriage and family life is unexpectedly removed when Bellew tracks Clare down at an all-Black party hosted by friends of the Redfields in their apartment atop a high residential building. Bellew angrily confronts Clare, but Clare smiles and acts unconcerned. When Irene angrily moves toward Clare and puts her hand on Clare’s arm, Clare tumbles out a nearby open window, to her death. The cause of her fall is unclear—whether she fainted and fell by accident, or fell deliberately. It is also possible that Irene pushed Clare, but no one accuses her."
Nearest,"On the Mediterranean Sea, Aeneas and his fellow Trojans flee from their home city of Troy, which has been destroyed by the Greeks. They sail for Italy, where Aeneas is destined to found Rome. As they near their destination, a fierce storm throws them off course and lands them in Carthage. Dido, Carthage’s founder and queen, welcomes them. Aeneas relates to Dido the long and painful story of his group’s travels thus far.
Aeneas tells of the sack of Troy that ended the Trojan War after ten years of Greek siege. In the final campaign, the Trojans were tricked when they accepted into their city walls a wooden horse that, unbeknownst to them, harbored several Greek soldiers in its hollow belly. He tells how he escaped the burning city with his father, Anchises; his son, Ascanius; and the hearth gods that represent their fallen city. Assured by the gods that a glorious future awaited him in Italy, he set sail with a fleet containing the surviving citizens of Troy. Aeneas relates the ordeals they faced on their journey. Twice they attempted to build a new city, only to be driven away by bad omens and plagues. Harpies, creatures that are part woman and part bird, cursed them, but they also encountered friendly countrymen unexpectedly. Finally, after the loss of Anchises and a bout of terrible weather, they made their way to Carthage.
Impressed by Aeneas’s exploits and sympathetic to his suffering, Dido, a Phoenician princess who fled her home and founded Carthage after her brother murdered her husband, falls in love with Aeneas. They live together as lovers for a period, until the gods remind Aeneas of his duty to found a new city. He determines to set sail once again. Dido is devastated by his departure, and kills herself by ordering a huge pyre to be built with Aeneas’s castaway possessions, climbing upon it, and stabbing herself with the sword Aeneas leaves behind.
As the Trojans make for Italy, bad weather blows them to Sicily, where they hold funeral games for the dead Anchises. The women, tired of the voyage, begin to burn the ships, but a downpour puts the fires out. Some of the travel-weary stay behind, while Aeneas, reinvigorated after his father visits him in a dream, takes the rest on toward Italy. Once there, Aeneas descends into the underworld, guided by the Sibyl of Cumae, to visit his father. He is shown a pageant of the future history and heroes of Rome, which helps him to understand the importance of his mission. Aeneas returns from the underworld, and the Trojans continue up the coast to the region of Latium.
The arrival of the Trojans in Italy begins peacefully. King Latinus, the Italian ruler, extends his hospitality, hoping that Aeneas will prove to be the foreigner whom, according to a prophecy, his daughter Lavinia is supposed to marry. But Latinus’s wife, Amata, has other ideas. She means for Lavinia to marry Turnus, a local suitor. Amata and Turnus cultivate enmity toward the newly arrived Trojans. Meanwhile, Ascanius hunts a stag that was a pet of the local herdsmen. A fight breaks out, and several people are killed. Turnus, riding this current of anger, begins a war.
Aeneas, at the suggestion of the river god Tiberinus, sails north up the Tiber to seek military support among the neighboring tribes. During this voyage, his mother, Venus, descends to give him a new set of weapons, wrought by Vulcan. While the Trojan leader is away, Turnus attacks. Aeneas returns to find his countrymen embroiled in battle. Pallas, the son of Aeneas’s new ally Evander, is killed by Turnus. Aeneas flies into a violent fury, and many more are slain by the day’s end.
The two sides agree to a truce so that they can bury the dead, and the Latin leaders discuss whether to continue the battle. They decide to spare any further unnecessary carnage by proposing a hand-to-hand duel between Aeneas and Turnus. When the two leaders face off, however, the other men begin to quarrel, and full-scale battle resumes. Aeneas is wounded in the thigh, but eventually the Trojans threaten the enemy city. Turnus rushes out to meet Aeneas, who wounds Turnus badly. Aeneas nearly spares Turnus but, remembering the slain Pallas, slays him instead."
Augmented,"In 1993, when Sara Saedi is almost thirteen, her older sister Samira reveals their family secret: the Saedis are illegal aliens, or undocumented immigrants. Although they have lived in the Bay Area near San Francisco, for over ten years and Sara knows no other life, the family can be deported at any time. Now, Sara’s ordinary teenage anxieties are augmented by the fear that she will be sent back to Iran. Americanized: Rebel Without a Green Card is an autobiographical account of Saedi growing up during the years following her sister’s revelation to her about their undocumented status.
When Sara’s parents, Ali and Shohreh Saedi, were growing up in Iran, Iran was a relatively open and secular society. In the early 1950s, Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh nationalized the oil industry and promoted democracy. A military coup deposed Mossadegh, however, and established a monarchy under Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. The Shah was overthrown in 1979, only to be replaced by Islamic rule under the Ayatollah Khomeini. Ali and Shohreh entered an arranged marriage in 1974. They lived in Louisiana until Ali graduated from Louisiana State University and return to Iran in 1976. Their daughter, Samira, was born the next year. In 1980, Sara was born, and war broke out between Iran and Iraq. In 1982, the Saedi family used tourist visas to get out of Iran. They arrived in San Jose, California, where Shohreh’s family had already settled.
Samira and Sara grow up in America and act like other American kids. Sara learns English from watching television and becomes obsessed with movie and TV stars, especially Winona Ryder and Ethan Hawke. Samira listens to grunge music. During her childhood, Sara fights with Samira constantly. But when Sara enters the high school where Samira is a senior, she becomes the little sister of the coolest girl in the school. Samira and her friends are glamorous celebrities to Sara. Their younger brother Kia, who is eight years younger than Sara, looks up to Sara in the same way. Just as Sara has kept Samira’s secrets from their parents, Kia keeps Sara’s secrets, except for when he ruins her life by revealing her hidden passion for schoolmate Evan Parker (a transgression for which Sara eventually forgives Kia). Sara spends her high school years obsessing over boys and hating herself for having severe acne and a Persian nose.
Ali and Shohreh work hard to give their children a better life and encourage their children to follow their dreams. However, their immigration status affects many aspects of the family’s life. Ali can’t work as an engineer because he’s undocumented, so he operates his own small business instead. Mortgages are difficult to obtain, and student loans are out of the question. The Saedis endure years of lost paperwork, legal delays, and bureaucratic frustration in order to obtain work permits and Social Security cards, then green cards, and, finally, citizenship. The fear of being deported permeates Sara’s adolescent existence. The great secret of her family’s undocumented status creates an invisible barrier between Sara and her American friends and classmates, no matter how much she tries to be like them.
The Saedis’ secrets are safe within the large circle of Sara’s extended family, consisting mostly of Shohreh’s relatives. Dayee Mehrdad, Shohreh’s successful older brother, heads this extensive Sanjideh clan. He encourages Sara, her nineteen first cousins, and their parents to gather at his large house and to support each other. Sara comes to appreciate her large family network and to recognize it as an advantage of Persian culture. She gets to know her paternal grandmother when Mamani comes from Iraq for long visits. Sara’s maternal grandmother, Mansoureh Naficy, or Maman Soury, lives with Sara’s family at the end of her life. Both grandmothers drive Sara crazy with their inability to speak English and their traditional ideas, but their complicated, dramatic, and romantic life stories fascinate her. Sara shares her parents’ sorrow at their mothers’ deaths.
During her junior year in high school, Sara obsesses over Evan Parker and finally works up the courage to invite him to her junior prom. He turns her down on because of the expense, crushing her romantic hopes. Sara desperately wants boys to like her, and she despises herself because they think of her as only a friend. In her senior year, she finally gets a boyfriend, a death metal nerd nicknamed Slash, so she has a date for her senior prom. Eventually, after her freshman year in college, Sara and Slash have sex, after which Sara concludes that sex is overrated. She and Slash break up two months later.
A crisis occurs during Sara’s senior year of high school: Unable to pay both their mortgage and Samira’s college tuition, Ali and Shohreh have to sell their house and move to a smaller place. The move devastates Sara, who vows that she will return and buy the house someday. Meanwhile, the Saedis’ immigration struggles reach a crisis point: They’ve been on hold so long that Samira might age out of the system. A last-minute rescue from an immigration lawyer gets Samira a green card, just days before her twenty-first birthday. Shohreh gets her green card at the same time. But Sara and Ali must wait two more years, followed by another five-year wait before they qualify for citizenship. Sara finally becomes a citizen in 2005. Sara, now officially Americanized, has even started using a fork instead of a spoon to eat her rice. She concludes that she’s a “spork,” both Iranian and American, and proud to be both.
Sara varies her memoir by adding family photos and excerpts from her diary from her teen years. At intervals, she also answers FAQs about Iranians and their culture. In the last sections of the memoir, Sara addresses readers who are undocumented immigrants. She compares the immigration policies of George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and Donald Trump and worries about anti-Muslim prejudices. She empathizes with the fears of these Americans still living in the shadows, reminds them of their rights, and assures them that millions of people support their dreams. Sara imagines herself if had she stayed in Iran. She writes a letter to that Sara, expressing the belief that they would have much in common despite all their differences."
Released,"The Giver is written from the point of view of Jonas, an eleven-year-old boy living in a futuristic society that has eliminated all pain, fear, war, and hatred. There is no prejudice, since everyone looks and acts basically the same, and there is very little competition. Everyone is unfailingly polite. The society has also eliminated choice: at age twelve every member of the community is assigned a job based on his or her abilities and interests. Citizens can apply for and be assigned compatible spouses, and each couple is assigned exactly two children each. The children are born to Birthmothers, who never see them, and spend their first year in a Nurturing Center with other babies, or “newchildren,” born that year. When their children are grown, family units dissolve and adults live together with Childless Adults until they are too old to function in the society. Then they spend their last years being cared for in the House of the Old until they are finally “released” from the society. In the community, release is death, but it is never described that way; most people think that after release, flawed newchildren and joyful elderly people are welcomed into the vast expanse of Elsewhere that surrounds the communities. Citizens who break rules or fail to adapt properly to the society’s codes of behavior are also released, though in their cases it is an occasion of great shame. Everything is planned and organized so that life is as convenient and pleasant as possible.
Jonas lives with his father, a Nurturer of new children, his mother, who works at the Department of Justice, and his seven-year-old sister Lily. At the beginning of the novel, he is apprehensive about the upcoming Ceremony of Twelve, when he will be given his official Assignment as a new adult member of the community. He does not have a distinct career preference, although he enjoys volunteering at a variety of different jobs. Though he is a well-behaved citizen and a good student, Jonas is different: he has pale eyes, while most people in his community have dark eyes, and he has unusual powers of perception. Sometimes objects “change” when he looks at them. He does not know it yet, but he alone in his community can perceive flashes of color; for everyone else, the world is as devoid of color as it is of pain, hunger, and inconvenience.
At the Ceremony of Twelve, Jonas is given the highly honored Assignment of Receiver of Memory. The Receiver is the sole keeper of the community’s collective memory. When the community went over to Sameness—its painless, warless, and mostly emotionless state of tranquility and harmony—it abandoned all memories of pain, war, and emotion, but the memories cannot disappear totally. Someone must keep them so that the community can avoid making the mistakes of the past, even though no one but the Receiver can bear the pain. Jonas receives the memories of the past, good and bad, from the current Receiver, a wise old man who tells Jonas to call him the Giver.
The Giver transmits memories by placing his hands on Jonas’s bare back. The first memory he receives is of an exhilarating sled ride. As Jonas receives memories from the Giver—memories of pleasure and pain, of bright colors and extreme cold and warm sun, of excitement and terror and hunger and love—he realizes how bland and empty life in his community really is. The memories make Jonas’s life richer and more meaningful, and he wishes that he could give that richness and meaning to the people he loves. But in exchange for their peaceful existence, the people of Jonas’s community have lost the capacity to love him back or to feel deep passion about anything. Since they have never experienced real suffering, they also cannot appreciate the real joy of life, and the life of individual people seems less precious to them. In addition, no one in Jonas’s community has ever made a choice of his or her own. Jonas grows more and more frustrated with the members of his community, and the Giver, who has felt the same way for many years, encourages him. The two grow very close, like a grandfather and a grandchild might have in the days before Sameness, when family members stayed in contact long after their children were grown.
Meanwhile, Jonas is helping his family take care of a problem newchild, Gabriel, who has trouble sleeping through the night at the Nurturing Center. Jonas helps the child to sleep by transmitting soothing memories to him every night, and he begins to develop a relationship with Gabriel that mirrors the family relationships he has experienced through the memories. When Gabriel is in danger of being released, the Giver reveals to Jonas that release is the same as death. Jonas’s rage and horror at this revelation inspire the Giver to help Jonas devise a plan to change things in the community forever. The Giver tells Jonas about the girl who had been designated the new Receiver ten years before. She had been the Giver’s own daughter, but the sadness of some of the memories had been too much for her and she had asked to be released. When she died, all of the memories she had accumulated were released into the community, and the community members could not handle the sudden influx of emotion and sensation. The Giver and Jonas plan for Jonas to escape the community and to actually enter Elsewhere. Once he has done that, his larger supply of memories will disperse, and the Giver will help the community to come to terms with the new feelings and thoughts, changing the society forever.
However, Jonas is forced to leave earlier than planned when his father tells him that Gabriel will be released the next day. Desperate to save Gabriel, Jonas steals his father’s bicycle and a supply of food and sets off for Elsewhere. Gradually, he enters a landscape full of color, animals, and changing weather, but also hunger, danger, and exhaustion. Avoiding search planes, Jonas and Gabriel travel for a long time until heavy snow makes bike travel impossible. Half-frozen, but comforting Gabriel with memories of sunshine and friendship, Jonas mounts a high hill. There he finds a sled—the sled from his first transmitted memory—waiting for him at the top. Jonas and Gabriel experience a glorious downhill ride on the sled. Ahead of them, they see—or think they see—the twinkling lights of a friendly village at Christmas, and they hear music. Jonas is sure that someone is waiting for them there."
Xa,"Malcolm X is born Malcolm Little in Omaha, Nebraska. The Midwest, during this period, is full of discrimination and racial violence. Malcolm’s family moves to Michigan where they continue to experience persecution and violence. White people murder Malcolm’s father and force his mother into a mental hospital. After living in a Michigan detention home and completing the eighth grade, Malcolm moves to Boston, Massachusetts, to live with his half-sister, Ella. In Boston Malcolm quickly becomes involved in urban nightlife. He passes for being much older than he is, wearing flashy clothes, gambling, drinking, doing drugs, and dating an older white woman, Sophia. Malcolm eventually takes a job as a railway porter. He then moves to New York, where he begins working as a hustler in Harlem. Malcolm’s various jobs there include running numbers, selling drugs, and steering white people to Black brothels. He also commits armed robberies.
When life in Harlem becomes too dangerous, Malcolm returns to Boston, where he becomes a house burglar and is eventually arrested. In prison, Malcolm transforms himself, converting to the branch of Islam promoted by the Nation of Islam, which has already converted a number of Malcolm’s siblings. Inspired by the faith, Malcolm stops using drugs; he reads voraciously, prays, studies English and Latin, and joins the prison debate team.
The prison releases Malcolm on parole. Malcolm moves in with his brother Wilfred and becomes very active in the Detroit temple of the Nation of Islam. Malcolm receives permission to drop his last name, which a white slave owner gave to one of his ancestors. He adopts the placeholder “X” as his last name, using the letter to represent the lost name of his African ancestors. Malcolm X soon meets the Nation of Islam’s leader, Elijah Muhammad, and rises quickly from the rank of temple assistant in Detroit to the Nation’s first national minister. Malcolm X becomes known throughout the United States, even outside of Muslim circles, as a fiery advocate for Black unity and militancy. The Nation of Islam’s leaders resent and fear Malcolm despite his allegiance to their cause, and they suspend him from the organization.
The Nation of Islam’s frustration with Malcolm intensifies, and Malcolm begins receiving death threats. After a divisive argument with Elijah Muhammad, Malcolm leaves the Nation of Islam. He uses his fame to found his own organization, Muslim Mosque, Inc. He sees his organization as more politically active than the Nation of Islam. On a trip to the Middle East and Africa, Malcolm discovers what he sees as true Islam. This version of Islam contrasts with the version of Islam he has been teaching. By the end of his life, Malcolm X is an international figure, welcomed by foreign leaders and committed to Islam as a religion that can alleviate the racial problems of the United States. He is assassinated in 1965."
Prophets,"The Old Testament is a collection of thirty-nine books about the history and religion of the people of Israel. The authors of these books are unknown, and each book possesses a unique tone, style, and message. Individually, they include stories, laws, and sayings that are intended to function as models of religious and ethical conduct. Together—through hundreds of characters and detailed events—they represent a unified narrative about God and his attempt to relate to humankind by relating to a specific group of people.
The Old Testament contains four main sections: the Pentateuch, the Former Prophets (or Historical Books), the Writings, and the Latter Prophets. This study guide covers books from the first three sections.
The Pentateuch
The Pentateuch comprises the first five books of the Old Testament. It depicts a series of beginnings—the beginning of the world, of humankind, and of God’s promise to the Israelites.
Genesis, the first book, opens with God’s creation of the world. The perfect world falls into evil when humans disobey God, and the human population divides into separate nations and languages. After many generations, God speaks to a man named Abraham. God makes a promise, or covenant, with Abraham to make his descendants into a great nation and to give them a great land. Abraham shows strong faith in God, and God seals his promise with a number of signs and tests. This special covenant with God passes on to Abraham’s son, Isaac, and to his grandson, Jacob. Together, they represent the patriarchs, or fathers, of the Israelite people. Jacob’s twelve sons move to Egypt after the youngest brother, Joseph, miraculously becomes a high official in Egypt.
In the Book of Exodus, the descendants of Jacob’s children have become a vast people, but the Pharaoh of Egypt holds them in slavery. God chooses one man, Moses, to rescue the Israelites. God sends ten plagues to Egypt, and, with miraculous signs and wonders, Moses leads the people out of Egypt and across the Red Sea. They go to Mount Sinai, where God appears in a cloud of thunder over the mountain and affirms to the Israelites the promise he made to Abraham. God commands them to worship only himself, and he gives them various ethical and religious laws.
The books of Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy continue the explanation of God’s religious laws and his promises to the people. The people must keep these laws to enter and enjoy the promised land, toward which they are heading. Despite God’s presence, the Israelites complain and disobey incessantly, inciting God’s wrath. They wander the wilderness for forty years in search of the promised land. These books continue the period of Moses’s legendary leadership and miracles, until his death at the end of Deuteronomy.
The Former Prophets
The Former Prophets, or the Historical Books, cover the history of the Israelites from Moses’s death to the fall of the nation in 587 b.c. In the books of Joshua and Judges, the Israelites successfully conquer the land promised to them by God, but they disobey God by worshipping the deities of the surrounding peoples. Neighboring nations invade and oppress the Israelites. God saves the people of Israel by designating judges, or rulers, to lead the people in warding off their enemies.
The two books of Samuel (First Samuel and Second Samuel) cover the rise of the united kingdom of Israel. Israel’s religious leader, Samuel, appoints a king named Saul. Saul disobeys God, however, and God chooses another man, David, to be Israel’s king. King Saul attempts to kill the young David, but fails. Saul’s death closes the first book. In the second book, David establishes the great kingdom of Israel. He conquers Israel’s surrounding enemies and establishes Jerusalem as the religious and political center of Israel.
The books of Kings (called 1 Kings and 2 Kings) trace the decline of Israel’s success. God blesses David’s son, Solomon, with immense wisdom. As king, Solomon expands Israel into an empire and builds a great temple in Jerusalem. Solomon disobeys God by worshipping other deities, and, at his death, the kingdom splits into a northern kingdom, Israel, and a southern kingdom, Judah. A host of evil kings leads the two kingdoms away from worshipping God. Despite the attempts of the prophets Elijah and Elisha to halt Israel’s wrongdoing, the two kingdoms fall to the Assyrian and Babylonian Empires. Jerusalem is destroyed, and the people are sent into exile.
The Writings
The Writings are placed after the historical books in the Christian Bible. Some of these are narratives covering the time of Israel’s exile in other nations and its eventual return to the homeland. The Book of Esther, for example, tells the story of an unassuming Jewish girl who becomes the queen of Persia and boldly saves the Jewish people from genocide.
Many of the Writings are books of poetry and wisdom, among the most important literature in the Old Testament. The Book of Job is a lengthy dialogue investigating God’s justice and the problem of human suffering. The Psalms are lyrical poems and hymns—many attributed to King David—that express humankind’s longing for God. The books of Proverbs and Ecclesiastes—similarly attributed to the wise King Solomon—offer sayings and instructions about the meaning of life and ethical behavior. Lastly, the Song of Solomon (also attributed to Solomon) is a romantic, lyric dialogue between a young woman and her lover."
Expectations,"Pip, a young orphan living with his sister and her husband in the marshes of Kent, sits in a cemetery one evening looking at his parents’ tombstones. Suddenly, an escaped convict springs up from behind a tombstone, grabs Pip, and orders him to bring him food and a file for his leg irons. Pip obeys, but the fearsome convict is soon captured anyway. The convict protects Pip by claiming to have stolen the items himself.
One day Pip is taken by his Uncle Pumblechook to play at Satis House, the home of the wealthy dowager Miss Havisham, who is extremely eccentric: she wears an old wedding dress everywhere she goes and keeps all the clocks in her house stopped at the same time. During his visit, he meets a beautiful young girl named Estella, who treats him coldly and contemptuously. Nevertheless, he falls in love with her and dreams of becoming a wealthy gentleman so that he might be worthy of her. He even hopes that Miss Havisham intends to make him a gentleman and marry him to Estella, but his hopes are dashed when, after months of regular visits to Satis House, Miss Havisham decides to help him become a common laborer in his family’s business.
With Miss Havisham’s guidance, Pip is apprenticed to his brother-in-law, Joe, who is the village blacksmith. Pip works in the forge unhappily, struggling to better his education with the help of the plain, kind Biddy and encountering Joe’s malicious day laborer, Orlick. One night, after an altercation with Orlick, Pip’s sister, known as Mrs. Joe, is viciously attacked and becomes a mute invalid. From her signals, Pip suspects that Orlick was responsible for the attack.
One day a lawyer named Jaggers appears with strange news: a secret benefactor has given Pip a large fortune, and Pip must come to London immediately to begin his education as a gentleman. Pip happily assumes that his previous hopes have come true—that Miss Havisham is his secret benefactor and that the old woman intends for him to marry Estella.
In London, Pip befriends a young gentleman named Herbert Pocket and Jaggers’s law clerk, Wemmick. He expresses disdain for his former friends and loved ones, especially Joe, but he continues to pine after Estella. He furthers his education by studying with the tutor Matthew Pocket, Herbert’s father. Herbert himself helps Pip learn how to act like a gentleman. When Pip turns twenty-one and begins to receive an income from his fortune, he will secretly help Herbert buy his way into the business he has chosen for himself. But for now, Herbert and Pip lead a fairly undisciplined life in London, enjoying themselves and running up debts. Orlick reappears in Pip’s life, employed as Miss Havisham’s porter, but is promptly fired by Jaggers after Pip reveals Orlick’s unsavory past. Mrs. Joe dies, and Pip goes home for the funeral, feeling tremendous grief and remorse. Several years go by, until one night a familiar figure barges into Pip’s room—the convict, Magwitch, who stuns Pip by announcing that he, not Miss Havisham, is the source of Pip’s fortune. He tells Pip that he was so moved by Pip’s boyhood kindness that he dedicated his life to making Pip a gentleman, and he made a fortune in Australia for that very purpose.
Pip is appalled, but he feels morally bound to help Magwitch escape London, as the convict is pursued both by the police and by Compeyson, his former partner in crime. A complicated mystery begins to fall into place when Pip discovers that Compeyson was the man who abandoned Miss Havisham at the altar and that Estella is Magwitch’s daughter. Miss Havisham has raised her to break men’s hearts, as revenge for the pain her own broken heart caused her. Pip was merely a boy for the young Estella to practice on; Miss Havisham delighted in Estella’s ability to toy with his affections.
As the weeks pass, Pip sees the good in Magwitch and begins to care for him deeply. Before Magwitch’s escape attempt, Estella marries an upper-class lout named Bentley Drummle. Pip makes a visit to Satis House, where Miss Havisham begs his forgiveness for the way she has treated him in the past, and he forgives her. Later that day, when she bends over the fireplace, her clothing catches fire and she goes up in flames. She survives but becomes an invalid. In her final days, she will continue to repent for her misdeeds and to plead for Pip’s forgiveness.
The time comes for Pip and his friends to spirit Magwitch away from London. Just before the escape attempt, Pip is called to a shadowy meeting in the marshes, where he encounters the vengeful, evil Orlick. Orlick is on the verge of killing Pip when Herbert arrives with a group of friends and saves Pip’s life. Pip and Herbert hurry back to effect Magwitch’s escape. They try to sneak Magwitch down the river on a rowboat, but they are discovered by the police, who Compeyson tipped off. Magwitch and Compeyson fight in the river, and Compeyson is drowned. Magwitch is sentenced to death, and Pip loses his fortune. Magwitch feels that his sentence is God’s forgiveness and dies at peace. Pip falls ill; Joe comes to London to care for him, and they are reconciled. Joe gives him the news from home: Orlick, after robbing Pumblechook, is now in jail; Miss Havisham has died and left most of her fortune to the Pockets; Biddy has taught Joe how to read and write. After Joe leaves, Pip decides to rush home after him and marry Biddy, but when he arrives there he discovers that she and Joe have already married.
Pip decides to go abroad with Herbert to work in the mercantile trade. Returning many years later, he encounters Estella in the ruined garden at Satis House. Drummle, her husband, treated her badly, but he is now dead. Pip finds that Estella’s coldness and cruelty have been replaced by a sad kindness, and the two leave the garden hand in hand, Pip believing that they will never part again. (Note: Dickens’s original ending to Great Expectations differed from the one described in this summary. The final Summary and Analysis section of this SparkNote provides a description of the first ending and explains why Dickens rewrote it.)"
Fish,"The novel begins with an incident near the end of the narrator’s father’s life, during a car trip. The father and son stop near a river, and the father puts his feet into the water and begins to remember something from his boyhood but stops before he tells his son the story. The narrator imagines his father as a timeless, mythical creature. Readers later learn that the narrator is Will and his father is Edward Bloom. 
Edward Bloom is born in Ashland, Alabama, during a drought. As his mother labors, a huge cloud appears, and it rains. Edward is an extraordinary child who can talk to animals and identify people by their footsteps. He knows everyone by name, and everyone loves him. According to the stories Edward tells, he builds a sixteen-foot snowman during a rare snowstorm, and his family sleeps in the trees. He has a growth spurt that puts him in bed for a year. He reads 10,000 books and remembers everything in them. Edward’s father is a farmer who grows a vine that reaches the clouds.  
The novel fast-forwards in time, with son Will recalling the time just before his father’s death. Edward does not like to sit still, so his serious illness is taking its toll on him. After Dr. Bennett tells them that nothing can be done, Will brings Edward a glass of water and they joke. Edward admits that he missed much of Will’s growing up, just like his own father did for him. Will tells him that having a son who loves him makes him great, which puts Edward at ease until he wants to tell another story. 
As a young man, Edward has a quiet charm which, along with his sense of humor, appeals to young women. He sees a young woman bathing in the Blue River and saves her from a snake. However, the snake turns into a stick when he throws it, and the mysterious girl disappears. Another time, Edward tames a ravenous giant named Karl who pillages Ashland. Young Edward visits Karl’s cave, wins his trust, and teaches the giant to farm. Another time, Ashland is so flooded that a lake covers it. Edward catches a giant catfish that pulls him underwater where he sees people from Ashland who have died in the flood.
At seventeen, Edward leaves home with nothing but his dreams. First, he passes through “the place that has no name”, a dark, damp town with strangely oppressed residents. When a man shows Edward around the town, he realizes that people get stuck here as they try to leave Ashland. The people try to get Edward to stay, but he moves on. A vicious black dog growls at Edward but then follows him out of town where he sees the mysterious Blue River girl for the second time. Edward is robbed and beaten. He reaches Ben Jimson’s Country Store where he meets the owner and his family. Edward stays there for a year and helps make the store more successful.
Edward goes to Auburn to college where his prowess includes running faster than anyone else. When his landlady has her glass eye stolen, Edward learns that a fraternity uses it in a hazing ritual. Edward returns the eye to the old lady who later appears at the barn and frightens the boys away. Edward sees a beautiful young woman kissing one of the boys from the fraternity. He asks the girl, Sandra Templeton, for a date, and she says yes, even though the fraternity boy, Don Price, has proposed to her. After three weeks, Sandra is in love with Edward, and he with her. Don follows them one night and Edward and Don fight, but Don loses. Edward asks Sandra to marry him, and she agrees.
Fast-forwarding again to the present, as Edward rests in his home while dying, he and Will talk about the possibility of heaven and hell. To Will’s frustration, every time they start to talk about something serious, Edward cracks a joke.
Edward meets his future in-laws, and Edward and Sandra move to Birmingham where he takes on three tasks: serving as a veterinary assistant, selling lingerie, and saving their neighborhood from a Helldog who threatens a young child. In time, Edward goes to war and serves on a naval ship that is torn open by a torpedo. After Edward jumps from the burning ship, the mysterious Blue River girl leads him to safety, along with crew members who follow.
The story returns to Edward’s decline while resting at home. Dr. Bennett and Sandra are frustrated by Edward, so Will goes in to talk to him. Will begs Edward to be serious, but Edward cannot. Edward knows exactly when he will die, and it’s not today. As a child, he had dreams that predicted the deaths of several family members. Edward tells yet another joke, which infuriates Will so much that he slams the door on his way out. 
The story moves back in time to Will’s birth. He is born on a day that Auburn beats Alabama in a football game. Edward thinks his job as a father is to fill up his son with wisdom and stories. While Will grows up, Edward travels all over the world, always returning home with outlandish stories. Edward saves Will’s life twice: Once by grabbing him from a ditch and another time by grabbing him from the air. Edward once dreams of his death. In the dream, crowds of people, each with a story of Edward’s generosity and power, wait outside his house. Edward waves to them from a window.  
As Will grows, Edward feels himself getting smaller. He travels more and more, staying away from home longer and longer. After Edward’s car breaks down in Specter, he buys the whole town, one parcel at a time. There, he discovers a beautiful young woman named Jenny Hill. Edward falls in love with her and moves her into a white house in town, but he’s gone so much that Jenny becomes bitter and strange. Weeds and then a swamp take over her house, so Edward must return fully to Sandra and Will.  
Soon, Edward learns that he is sick with cancer. He returns home, and his life begins to ebb, little by little. Edward swims every day, but the pool turns swampy and green. One day, Will thinks he sees Edward turn into a fish and calls an ambulance when Edward passes out in the water. Soon, Edward is in a hospital, hooked up to life support.
When Will goes into the hospital room to talk to his father, Edward still tells the same “stupid” jokes that he has always told. Will encourages him to be more serious and straightforward, but Edward’s behavior doesn’t change. The kind Dr. Bennett tends to Edward but finally admits that there is nothing more to do. Edward is near death when he asks Will to help him escape. After a serious conversation about fatherhood, Will drives his father to a river. When Will carries Edward to the water and releases him, Edward turns into a silver fish that swims away."
None,"Eight people, all strangers to each other, are invited to Indian Island, off the English coast. Vera Claythorne, a former governess, thinks she has been hired as a secretary; Philip Lombard, an adventurer, and William Blore, an ex-detective, think they have been hired to look out for trouble over the weekend; Dr. Armstrong thinks he has been hired to look after the wife of the island’s owner. Emily Brent, General Macarthur, Tony Marston, and Judge Wargrave think they are going to visit old friends.
	When they arrive on the island, the guests are greeted by Mr. and Mrs. Rogers, the butler and housekeeper, who report that the host, someone they call Mr. Owen, will not arrive until the next day. That evening, as all the guests gather in the drawing room after an excellent dinner, they hear a recorded voice accusing each of them of a specific murder committed in the past and never uncovered. They compare notes and realize that none of them, including the servants, knows “Mr. Owen,” which suggests that they were brought here according to someone’s strange plan.
	As they discuss what to do, Tony Marston chokes on poisoned whiskey and dies. Frightened, the party retreats to bed, where almost everyone is plagued by guilt and memories of their crimes. Vera Claythorne notices the similarity between the death of Marston and the first verse of a nursery rhyme, “Ten Little Indians,” that hangs in each bedroom. 
	The next morning the guests find that Mrs. Rogers apparently died in her sleep. The guests hope to leave that morning, but the boat that regularly delivers supplies to the island does not show up. Blore, Lombard, and Armstrong decide that the deaths must have been murders and determine to scour the island in search of the mysterious Mr. Owen. They find no one, however. Meanwhile, the oldest guest, General Macarthur, feels sure he is going to die and goes to look out at the ocean. Before lunch, Dr. Armstrong finds the general dead of a blow to the head.
	The remaining guests meet to discuss their situation. They decide that one of them must be the killer. Many make vague accusations, but Judge Wargrave reminds them that the existing evidence suggests any of them could be the killer. Afternoon and dinner pass restlessly, and everyone goes to bed, locking his or her door before doing so. The next morning, they find that Rogers has been killed while chopping wood in preparation for breakfast. At this point, the guests feel sure the murders are being carried out according to the dictates of the nursery rhyme. Also, they realize that the dining-room table initially featured ten Indian figures, but with each death one of the figures disappears.
	After breakfast, Emily Brent feels slightly giddy, and she remains alone at the table for a while. She is soon found dead, her neck having been injected with poison. At this point, Wargrave initiates an organized search of everyone’s belongings, and anything that could be used as a weapon is locked away. The remaining guests sit together, passing time and casting suspicious looks at each other. Finally, Vera goes to take a bath, but she is startled by a piece of seaweed hanging from her ceiling and cries out. Blore, Lombard, and Armstrong run to help her, only to return downstairs to find Wargrave draped in a curtain that resembles courtroom robes and bearing a red mark on his forehead. Armstrong examines the body and reports that Wargrave has been shot in the head.
	That night, Blore hears footsteps in the hall; upon checking, he finds that Armstrong is not in his room. Blore and Lombard search for Armstrong, but they cannot find him anywhere in the house or on the island. When they return from searching, they discover another Indian figure missing from the table.
	Vera, Lombard, and Blore go outside, resolving to stay in the safety of the open land. Blore decides to go back into the house to get food. The other two hear a crash, and they find someone has pushed a statue out of a second-story window, killing Blore as he approached the house. Vera and Lombard retreat to the shore, where they find Armstrong’s drowned body on the beach. Convinced that Lombard is the killer, Vera steals Lombard’s gun and shoots him. She returns to her bedroom to rest, happy to have survived. But upon finding a noose waiting for her in her room, she feels a strange compulsion to enact the last line of the nursery rhyme, and hangs herself.
	The mystery baffles the police until a manuscript in a bottle is found. The late Judge Wargrave wrote the manuscript explaining that he planned the murders because he wanted to punish those whose crimes are not punishable under law. Wargrave frankly admits to his own lust for blood and pleasure in seeing the guilty punished. When a doctor told Wargrave he was dying, he decided to die in a blaze, instead of letting his life trickle away. He discusses how he chose his victims and how he did away with Marston, Mr. and Mrs. Rogers, Macarthur, and Emily Brent. Wargrave then describes how he tricked Dr. Armstrong into helping him fake his own death, promising to meet the doctor by the cliffs to discuss a plan. When Armstrong arrived, Wargrave pushed him over the edge into the sea, then returned to the house and pretended to be dead. His ruse enabled him to dispose of the rest of the guests without drawing their suspicion. Once Vera hanged herself on a noose that he prepared for her, Wargrave planned to shoot himself in such a way that his body would fall onto the bed as if it had been laid there. Thus, he hoped, the police would find ten dead bodies on an empty island."
Been,"Jack Worthing, the play’s protagonist, is a pillar of the community in Hertfordshire, where he is guardian to Cecily Cardew, the pretty, eighteen-year-old granddaughter of the late Thomas Cardew, who found and adopted Jack when he was a baby. In Hertfordshire, Jack has responsibilities: he is a major landowner and justice of the peace, with tenants, farmers, and a number of servants and other employees all dependent on him. For years, he has also pretended to have an irresponsible black-sheep brother named Ernest who leads a scandalous life in pursuit of pleasure and is always getting into trouble of a sort that requires Jack to rush grimly off to his assistance. In fact, Ernest is merely Jack’s alibi, a phantom that allows him to disappear for days at a time and do as he likes. No one but Jack knows that he himself is Ernest. Ernest is the name Jack goes by in London, which is where he really goes on these occasions—probably to pursue the very sort of behavior he pretends to disapprove of in his imaginary brother.
Jack is in love with Gwendolen Fairfax, the cousin of his best friend, Algernon Moncrieff. When the play opens, Algernon, who knows Jack as Ernest, has begun to suspect something, having found an inscription inside Jack’s cigarette case addressed to “Uncle Jack” from someone who refers to herself as “little Cecily.” Algernon suspects that Jack may be leading a double life, a practice he seems to regard as commonplace and indispensable to modern life. He calls a person who leads a double life a “Bunburyist,” after a nonexistent friend he pretends to have, a chronic invalid named Bunbury, to whose deathbed he is forever being summoned whenever he wants to get out of some tiresome social obligation.
At the beginning of Act 1, Jack drops in unexpectedly on Algernon and announces that he intends to propose to Gwendolen. Algernon confronts him with the cigarette case and forces him to come clean, demanding to know who “Jack” and “Cecily” are. Jack confesses that his name isn’t really Ernest and that Cecily is his ward, a responsibility imposed on him by his adoptive father’s will. Jack also tells Algernon about his fictional brother. Jack says he’s been thinking of killing off this fake brother, since Cecily has been showing too active an interest in him. Without meaning to, Jack describes Cecily in terms that catch Algernon’s attention and make him even more interested in her than he is already.
Gwendolen and her mother, Lady Bracknell, arrive, which gives Jack an opportunity to propose to Gwendolen. Jack is delighted to discover that Gwendolen returns his affections, but he is alarmed to learn that Gwendolen is fixated on the name Ernest, which she says “inspires absolute confidence.” Gwendolen makes clear that she would not consider marrying a man who was not named Ernest.
Lady Bracknell interviews Jack to determine his eligibility as a possible son-in-law, and during this interview she asks about his family background. When Jack explains that he has no idea who his parents were and that he was found, by the man who adopted him, in a handbag in the cloakroom at Victoria Station, Lady Bracknell is scandalized. She forbids the match between Jack and Gwendolen and sweeps out of the house.
In Act 2, Algernon shows up at Jack’s country estate posing as Jack’s brother Ernest. Meanwhile, Jack, having decided that Ernest has outlived his usefulness, arrives home in deep mourning, full of a story about Ernest having died suddenly in Paris. He is enraged to find Algernon there masquerading as Ernest but has to go along with the charade. If he doesn’t, his own lies and deceptions will be revealed.
While Jack changes out of his mourning clothes, Algernon, who has fallen hopelessly in love with Cecily, asks her to marry him. He is surprised to discover that Cecily already considers that they are engaged, and he is charmed when she reveals that her fascination with “Uncle Jack’s brother” led her to invent an elaborate romance between herself and him several months ago. Algernon is less enchanted to learn that part of Cecily’s interest in him derives from the name Ernest, which, unconsciously echoing Gwendolen, she says “inspires absolute confidence.”
Algernon goes off in search of Dr. Chasuble, the local rector, to see about getting himself christened Ernest. Meanwhile, Gwendolen arrives, having decided to pay Jack an unexpected visit. Gwendolen is shown into the garden, where Cecily orders tea and attempts to play hostess. Cecily has no idea how Gwendolen figures into Jack’s life, and Gwendolen, for her part, has no idea who Cecily is. Gwendolen initially thinks Cecily is a visitor to the Manor House and is disconcerted to learn that Cecily is “Mr. Worthing’s ward.” She notes that Ernest has never mentioned having a ward, and Cecily explains that it is not Ernest Worthing who is her guardian but his brother Jack and, in fact, that she is engaged to be married to Ernest Worthing. Gwendolen points out that this is impossible as she herself is engaged to Ernest Worthing. The tea party degenerates into a war of manners.
Jack and Algernon arrive toward the climax of this confrontation, each having separately made arrangements with Dr. Chasuble to be christened Ernest later that day. Each of the young ladies points out that the other has been deceived: Cecily informs Gwendolen that her fiancé is really named Jack and Gwendolen informs Cecily that hers is really called Algernon. The two women demand to know where Jack’s brother Ernest is, since both of them are engaged to be married to him. Jack is forced to admit that he has no brother and that Ernest is a complete fiction. Both women are shocked and furious, and they retire to the house arm in arm.
Act 3 takes place in the drawing room of the Manor House, where Cecily and Gwendolen have retired. When Jack and Algernon enter from the garden, the two women confront them. Cecily asks Algernon why he pretended to be her guardian’s brother. Algernon tells her he did it in order to meet her. Gwendolen asks Jack whether he pretended to have a brother in order to come into London to see her as often as possible, and she interprets his evasive reply as an affirmation. The women are somewhat appeased but still concerned over the issue of the name. However, when Jack and Algernon tell Gwendolen and Cecily that they have both made arrangements to be christened Ernest that afternoon, all is forgiven and the two pairs of lovers embrace. At this moment, Lady Bracknell’s arrival is announced.
Lady Bracknell has followed Gwendolen from London, having bribed Gwendolen’s maid to reveal her destination. She demands to know what is going on. Gwendolen again informs Lady Bracknell of her engagement to Jack, and Lady Bracknell reiterates that a union between them is out of the question. Algernon tells Lady Bracknell of his engagement to Cecily, prompting her to inspect Cecily and inquire into her social connections, which she does in a routine and patronizing manner that infuriates Jack. He replies to all her questions with a mixture of civility and sarcasm, withholding until the last possible moment the information that Cecily is actually worth a great deal of money and stands to inherit still more when she comes of age. At this, Lady Bracknell becomes genuinely interested.
Jack informs Lady Bracknell that, as Cecily’s legal guardian, he refuses to give his consent to her union with Algernon. Lady Bracknell suggests that the two young people simply wait until Cecily comes of age, and Jack points out that under the terms of her grandfather’s will, Cecily does not legally come of age until she is thirty-five. Lady Bracknell asks Jack to reconsider, and he points out that the matter is entirely in her own hands. As soon as she consents to his marriage to Gwendolen, Cecily can have his consent to marry Algernon. However, Lady Bracknell refuses to entertain the notion. She and Gwendolen are on the point of leaving when Dr. Chasuble arrives and happens to mention Cecily’s governess, Miss Prism. At this, Lady Bracknell starts and asks that Miss Prism be sent for.
When the governess arrives and catches sight of Lady Bracknell, she begins to look guilty and furtive. Lady Bracknell accuses her of having left her sister’s house twenty-eight years before with a baby and never returned. She demands to know where the baby is. Miss Prism confesses she doesn’t know, explaining that she lost the baby, having absentmindedly placed it in a handbag in which she had meant to place the manuscript for a novel she had written. Jack asks what happened to the bag, and Miss Prism says she left it in the cloakroom of a railway station. Jack presses her for further details and goes racing offstage, returning a few moments later with a large handbag. When Miss Prism confirms that the bag is hers, Jack throws himself on her with a cry of “Mother!” It takes a while before the situation is sorted out, but before too long we understand that Jack is not the illegitimate child of Miss Prism but the legitimate child of Lady Bracknell’s sister and, therefore, Algernon’s older brother. Furthermore, Jack had been originally christened “Ernest John.” All these years Jack has unwittingly been telling the truth: Ernest is his name, as is Jack, and he does have an unprincipled younger brother—Algernon. Again the couples embrace, Miss Prism and Dr. Chasuble follow suit, and Jack acknowledges that he now understands “the vital Importance of Being Earnest.”"
Main,"Carol Milford attends Blodgett College in Minneapolis and dreams about settling down in a prairie village and transforming it into a place of beauty. After graduation, she works as a librarian at St. Paul for three years. She meets Dr. Will Kennicott at a friend's house, and he begins courting her. After courting for a year, they marry and move to Kennicott's hometown of Gopher Prairie. Disappointed by her first impression of the Gopher Prairie, Carol finds the town to be ugly and the townspeople to be provincial. The townspeople gossip all the time and are completely uninterested in cultural or social issues. Mrs. Bogart, the Kennicotts' neighbor, proves to be a religious hypocrite who idly gossips about everyone. However, Bea Sorenson arrives in Gopher Prairie on the same day as Carol. Awestruck by the magnificence of the town, which is larger than any she town has ever seen, Bea decides to stay and becomes Carol's maid.
Carol refurbishes Kennicott's old-fashioned house with modern furniture and makes elaborate preparations for a party, a party unlike any party the town has ever seen. However, Carol discovers that the dull townspeople do not like change. Furthermore, she feels disheartened to learn that the townspeople constantly watch her every move and criticize her for being different from them. They criticize the way she dresses and the way she acts. She finds few friends in Gopher Prairie, except for the lawyer, Guy Pollock, and the high school teacher, Vida Sherwin. Carol also becomes friends with her maid, Bea, and the town's handyman, Miles Bjornstam. While the townspeople treat Miles as an outcast because he supports socialism and the Democratic Party, Carol finds herself drawn to him.
Carol tries to get the people to build a new city hall, school, and library, and a more comfortable rest room for the farmer's wives. However, no one shares her interest in constructing new buildings or helping the town's poor. Everyone tells her that they do not want to spend money on unnecessary things like buildings. Carol idealizes Guy Pollock, thinking that he shares her interest in reforming the town. However, she eventually finds out that he does not care for social reform and that he has settled down to enjoy small town life. As Guy explains to Carol, he has the ""Village Virus.""
Carol joins the Jolly Seventeen, the women's social club, and the Thanatopsis Club, the women's study group. When she tries to change the unimaginative club programs, the other members ignore her suggestions. Along with a group of friends, Carol forms a drama group and stages a play, which turns out to be horribly mediocre. Appointed to the library board, she eagerly makes suggestions to how the library could encourage reading, but the local librarian opposes her suggestions, preferring to discourage readers in order to keep the books clean.
Carol and Kennicott have a bitter argument in which he accuses her of feeling superior to everyone else in town. After they make up, she begins to fall in love with him all over again. She idealizes him as a heroic doctor and witnesses him amputating a farmer's arm one night. But life in Gopher Prairie continues to offer Carol no challenges. She gives birth to a boy, whom she names Hugh after her deceased father. Kennicott's aunt and uncle, the Smails, come to live in Gopher Prairie and prove a constant irritation to Carol.
Meanwhile, Bea and Miles Bjornstam marry. The townspeople still shun Bjornstam and do not visit his household. Unfortunately, Bea and her son Olaf die from typhoid. Heartbroken, Bjornstam leaves town, and the townspeople blame him for his family's deaths. Then, Carol's friend Vida Sherwin marries Raymond Wutherspoon, another local. When World War I breaks out, Raymond joins the army. Although Kennicott also wants to enlist, the medical council requests that he stay in Gopher Prairie to provide his services.
Erik Valborg, the son of a Swedish farmer, comes to Gopher Prairie to work as the tailor's assistant. Fern Mullins, a young teacher, also arrives in Gopher Prairie and boards in Mrs. Bogart's house. Carol finds the company of these two new residents stimulating because they share her love for books, music, dance, and drama. Cy Bogart, the leader of the town's gang of boys and Mrs. Bogart's son, ruins Fern's reputation when he falsely accuses Fern of getting him drunk and making sexual advances on him. Forced to resign from the school, Fern leaves Gopher Prairie.
Erik finds himself attracted to Carol and goes out with her for long walks. Kennicott knows about the close relationship between Erik and Carol but does not really mind because he knows that the two are only good friends who share the same intellectual interests. As Carol and Kennicott's marriage deteriorates, he begins an affair with Maud Dryer. However, after Fern leaves town, Kennicott decides that Carol and Erik should stop seeing each other in order to avoid another scandal. Erik leaves Gopher Prairie.
Kennicott then decides to take Carol on a long tour of California in order to get away from the gossips in Gopher Prairie. When they return, Carol feels tired because the hypocrisy and narrow-mindedness of the people of Gopher Prairie has not changed at all. She decides to leave and takes her son, Hugh, with her. Although Kennicott feels distressed when Carol leaves, she assures him that she will return someday. Carol moves to Washington, D.C., where she works for two years. Though she enjoys the beautiful city, she feels lonely in its largely anonymous crowds. Kennicott visits Carol in Washington and begins courting her for the second time. Recognizing her husband's love, Carol decides to return to Gopher Prairie.
Carol's experience in Washington helps her acquire maturity and a new outlook toward life. She determines that she can at least play a small role in changing life in Gopher Prairie. When Carol returns, she accepts the small town and its people as they are. However, she still fights small battles to make the town a better place. She gives birth to a daughter, hoping that the child will continue her fight. In the closing lines of the novel, while Carol talks about her struggle reform Gopher Prairie, Kennicott only half-listens to her and thinks only about the weather."
Survival,"Primo Levi’s memoir depicts life and death in the final days of the Auschwitz concentration camp complex from his incarceration in February 1944 to the Soviet liberation of the camp in January 1945. At the time of Levi’s arrest as a Jew under the Italian Racial Laws, World War II had been in progress since September 1939. The Nazis’ forced labor camps filled the gaps in their dwindling workforce on the home front to continue the war effort.
Levi is one of 650 Italians deported to Auschwitz as part of that labor force. Once in Poland, the train stops on a deserted plain and the young and fit are separated from the children, the old, and the sick. A total of ninety-six men and twenty-nine women board trucks bound for the respective camps of Monowitz-Buna and Birkenau in the Auschwitz complex, and the other 500 are killed. Intake at the Monowitz-Buna camp involves the seizure of all their belongings, the shaving of their heads, and the tattooing of identification numbers on their arms. Prisoners are assigned to blocks where pairs share narrow bunks. The daily routine is enforced by a cacophony of shouting in a variety of languages as well as beatings. Each man is assigned to a work squad. Some work sites are located kilometers away from the barracks where private corporations maintain plants to utilize the slave labor. The prisoners walk to these sites in their prison-issue cotton shirts, jackets, and wooden clogs in below-freezing weather. Hunger is constant, to the point that the men dream of food and make eating movements in their sleep.
When Levi has a job injury, he spends a few weeks in the Ka-Be infirmary. There he learns of the process of selection to send those no longer able to work to the gas chambers in Birkenau. He finds out that Ka-Be is the center of an extensive barter system. All personal belongings of those admitted are confiscated for later use to barter for medical supplies, which are stolen from the private corporation worksites by prisoners looking to improve their quality of life. Levi analyzes the complex political and economic system in the camp alongside the dynamic of the antipathy existing between the German political soldiers of the Nazi Party (SS) and the industrialists. At the center of the book, he lays out the personal qualities and strategies that improve a prisoner’s chances of survival. The book will go on to present lessons in working the system.
Levi’s own turning point comes with an appointment to the Chemical Kommando, a squad of chemists tasked with supporting the Buna synthetic rubber plant. He develops friendships and continues to upgrade his survival skills. An influx of Hungarian internees in the spring creates overcrowding conditions. In June and July, the inmates feel fleeting hope hearing news of developments in the war: the Allies’ landing in Normandy; the Russian offensive; and a failed attempt to assassinate Hitler. In August, the Allies begin bombing the area of Poland where Auschwitz is situated and continue throughout the fall. The bombardments halt work on the Buna rubber plant. In October, the German SS commandant conducts a selection to deal with overcrowded conditions in the blocks. This involves sorting the thousands of prisoners in the camp into two categories: those who are sent to die in the gas chambers at Birkenau, and those who are spared. Levi and his best friend, Alberto, are spared.
A group of subversive prisoners blow up a crematorium in Birkenau. In November, Levi is chosen as one of three prisoner chemists to work in the Buna laboratory as the Germans gear up once again to begin production of the rubber. Civilian prisoners have brought scarlet fever, diphtheria, and typhus into the camp population. Toward the end of December, the German SS holds a public hanging for the one prisoner who hasn’t already been executed for the crematorium destruction. Levi feels ashamed because, despite he and Alberto’s organized schemes to collect large amounts of food and clothing, they have still let the Germans defeat their spirits.
On January 11, Levi comes down with scarlet fever and is admitted to the infectious disease ward of the Ka-Be infirmary with twelve other patients in various stages of scarlet fever, diphtheria, and typhus. With the Soviet troops advancing, the Germans evacuate Auschwitz early on January 18, taking the fit and leaving the sick behind. Alberto leaves with the healthy prisoners, never to be seen by Levi again. Bombardments begin that day, destroying parts of the complex around the infirmary. From January 18 through 20, the prisoners watch the Wehrmacht fleeing the oncoming Soviet army. The Soviet army enters the camp on January 27 and sets up a temporary hospital to care for the survivors. Levi ends his memoir with an epitaph for the men who shared the last ten days as a team of survivors."
Uniquely,"In Outliers: The Story of Success, Malcolm Gladwell considers the circumstances that lead to success. The first half of the book looks closely at how opportunities matter more in the lives of successful people than hard work or raw talent. The second half of the book focuses on cultural legacies: behavioral tendencies rooted in their ancestral past.
Part One examines the role of opportunity in the lives of extremely successful people. Gladwell’s first example is the Canadian Hockey League, the world’s most competitive youth hockey league. Since the cutoff date for the Canadian leagues that serve the youngest players is January 1, those born in the first part of the calendar year are much larger and more coordinated than their peers. The larger and more coordinated kids are given more playing time and better coaching, and thus become better players by the time they reach the top league. An overwhelming majority of Canadian professional hockey players have birthdays in January, February or March.
Gladwell proposes that 10,000 hours of practice is needed to master a skill, even for prodigies like Mozart. Bill Joy, Bill Gates, and the Beatles all worked hard to achieve success but benefited from opportunities they did not create. Joy, one of the founders of Sun Microsystems, happened to attend one of the first colleges in the world with a time-sharing terminal. In graduate school, he had a terminal in his room, where he spent all of his free time programming. Gates happened to attend a private high school with a time-sharing terminal connected to a mainframe in Seattle. He also was able to spend all of his free time programming. Early on, the Beatles were hired to play long shows day after day in Hamburg, Germany. 
Birth year or era is another form of opportunity. Gates and Joy (as well as other early programmers) all reached the end of their teen years just as personal computers became available to the public. In another example, fourteen of the top seventy-five richest people in the history of the world happened to be alive at the same time, in the same country: the United States in the mid-1800s.
Opportunity matters more than an individual’s IQ. Using a study conducted by Lewis Terman, the creator of the Stanford-Binet IQ test, Gladwell shows that “practical intelligence” is as important as “analytical intelligence.” He also contrasts Chris Langan, one of the world’s smartest living people, with Robert Oppenheimer. While both had difficulties in college, only Oppenheimer had a successful life, due to his practical intelligence.
The last portion of Part One looks at Joe Flom, a successful lawyer from New York City. While he was born into a poor family to Jewish immigrants (in a time when Jewish immigrants were not treated well), many of the disadvantages in his life were actually benefits and directly contributed to his success.
Part Two investigates cultural legacies. Using flight recorder transcripts from several plane crashes from the last few decades, Gladwell shows that cultural expectations and habits can be a severe hindrance to pilots. Copilots from countries that have a high “Power Distance Index” (those that show the most deference to authority) will often avoid telling pilots that they are making mistakes, even when the mistakes are potentially fatal. After recognizing the dangers of such cultural expectations, commercial aviation has instituted programs to change the way flight crews talk with one another. 
Gladwell next analyzes the disparity in public school math test scores between Eastern and Western countries. He suggests that the cultures in which rice paddy farming is historically important have a stronger work ethic. Using various examples, Gladwell shows that hard work has a greater impact on success in learning mathematics than intelligence. 
The final example is an examination of the KIPP school in the South Bronx and the “achievement gap” between socioeconomic groups. American students from middle-class and affluent households retain more information over summer vacation and are more likely to make additional gains than students from low-income households. The KIPP school uses longer school days and summer programming to eliminate the achievement gap for low-income children. While the work schedule is very rigorous, the school’s students go on to great academic success.
Gladwell demonstrates that if more opportunities were available, there would be far more successful people and the world would be richer for it."
Understands,"Siddhartha, the handsome and respected son of a Brahmin, lives with his father in ancient India. Everyone in the village expects Siddhartha to be a successful Brahmin like his father. Siddhartha enjoys a near-idyllic existence with his best friend, Govinda, but he is secretly dissatisfied. He performs all the rituals of religion, and he does what religion says should bring him happiness and peace. Nonetheless, he feels something is missing. His father and the other elders have still not achieved enlightenment, and he feels that staying with them will not settle the questions he has about the nature of his existence. Siddhartha believes his father has already passed on all the wisdom their community has to offer, but he longs for something more. 
One day, a group of wandering ascetics called Samanas passes through town. They are starved and almost naked and have come to beg for food. They believe enlightenment can be reached through asceticism, a rejection of the body and physical desire. The path the Samanas preach is quite different from the one Siddhartha has been taught, and he believes it may provide some of the answers he is looking for. He decides to follow this new path. Siddhartha’s father does not want him to join the Samanas, but he cannot dissuade Siddhartha. Govinda also wants to find a path to enlightenment, and he joins Siddhartha in this new life.
	Siddhartha adjusts quickly to the ways of the Samanas because of the patience and discipline he learned in the Brahmin tradition. He learns how to free himself from the traditional trappings of life, and so loses his desire for property, clothing, sexuality, and all sustenance except that required to live. His goal is to find enlightenment by eliminating his Self, and he successfully renounces the pleasures of the world. 
Sunburned and half-starved, Siddhartha soon ceases to resemble the boy he used to be. Govinda is quick to praise the Samanas and notes the considerable moral and spiritual improvements they both have achieved since joining. Siddhartha, however, is still dissatisfied. The path of self-denial does not provide a permanent solution for him. He points out that the oldest Samanas have lived the life for many years but have yet to attain true spiritual enlightenment. The Samanas have been as unsuccessful as the Brahmins Siddhartha and Govinda left behind. At this time, Siddhartha and the other Samanas begin to hear about a new holy man named Gotama the Buddha who has attained the total spiritual enlightenment called Nirvana. Govinda convinces Siddhartha they both should leave the Samanas and seek out Gotama. Siddhartha and Govinda inform the leader of the Samanas of their decision to leave. The leader is clearly displeased, but Siddhartha silences him with an almost magical, hypnotizing gaze. 
Siddhartha and Govinda find Gotama’s camp of followers and are taken in. Siddhartha is initially pleased with Gotama, and he and Govinda are instructed in the Eightfold Path, the four main points, and other aspects of Buddhism. However, while Govinda is convinced to join Gotama and his followers, Siddhartha still has doubts. He has noticed a contradiction in Gotama’s teachings: Siddhartha questions how one can embrace the unity of all things, as the Buddha asks, if they are also being told to overcome the physical world. Siddhartha realizes Buddhism will not give him the answers he needs. Sadly, he leaves Govinda behind and begins a search for the meaning of life, the achievement of which he feels will not be dependent on religious instruction. 
	Siddhartha decides to embark on a life free from meditation and the spiritual quests he has been pursuing, and to instead learn from the pleasures of the body and the material world. In his new wanderings, Siddhartha meets a friendly ferryman, fully content with his simple life. Siddhartha crosses the ferryman’s river and comes to a city. Here, a beautiful courtesan named Kamala entrances him. He knows she would be the best one to teach him about the world of love, but Kamala will not have him unless he proves he can fit into the material world. She convinces him to take up the path of the merchant. With her help, Siddhartha soon finds employment with a merchant named Kamaswami and begins to learn the trade. While Siddhartha learns the wisdom of the business world and begins to master the skills Kamaswami teaches him, Kamala becomes his lover and teaches him what she knows about love.
	Years pass, and Siddhartha’s business acumen increases. Soon, he is a rich man and enjoys the benefits of an affluent life. He gambles, drinks, and dances, and anything that can be bought in the material world is his for the taking. Siddhartha is detached from this life, however, and he can never see it as more than a game. He doesn’t care if he wins or loses this game because it doesn’t touch his spirit in any lasting way. The more he obtains in the material world, the less it satisfies him, and he is soon caught in a cycle of unhappiness that he tries to escape by engaging in even more gambling, drinking, and sex. When he is at his most disillusioned, he dreams that Kamala’s rare songbird is dead in its cage. He understands that the material world is slowly killing him without providing him with the enlightenment for which he has been searching. One night, he resolves to leave it all behind and departs without notifying either Kamala or Kamaswami. 
Sick at heart, Siddhartha wanders until he finds a river. He considers drowning himself, but he instead falls asleep on the riverbank. While he is sleeping, Govinda, who is now a Buddhist monk, passes by. Not recognizing Siddhartha, he watches over the sleeping man to protect him from snakes. Siddhartha immediately recognizes Govinda when he wakes up, but Govinda notes that Siddhartha has changed significantly from his days with the Samanas and now appears to be a rich man. Siddhartha responds that he is currently neither a Samana nor a rich man. Siddhartha wishes to become someone new. Govinda soon leaves to continue on his journey, and Siddhartha sits by the river and considers where his life has taken him. 
	Siddhartha seeks out the same content ferryman he met years before. The ferryman, who introduces himself as Vasudeva, radiates an inner peace that Siddhartha wishes to attain. Vasudeva says he himself has attained this sense of peace through many years of studying the river. Siddhartha expresses a desire to likewise learn from the river, and Vasudeva agrees to let Siddhartha live and work beside him. Siddhartha studies the river and begins to take from it a spiritual enlightenment unlike any he has ever known. While sitting by the river, he contemplates the unity of all life, and in the river’s voice he hears the word Om. 

	One day Kamala the courtesan approaches the ferry along with her son on a pilgrimage to visit Gotama, who is said to be dying. Before they can cross, a snake bites Kamala. Siddhartha and Vasudeva tend to Kamala, but the bite kills her. Before she dies, she tells Siddhartha that he is the father of her eleven-year-old son. Siddhartha does his best to console and provide for his son, but the boy is spoiled and cynical. Siddhartha’s son dislikes life with the two ferrymen and wishes to return to his familiar city and wealth. Vasudeva believes Siddhartha’s son should be allowed to leave if he wants to, but Siddhartha is not ready to let him go. One morning, Siddhartha awakens to find his son has run away and stolen all of his and Vasudeva’s money. Siddhartha chases after the boy, but as he reaches the city he realizes the chase is futile. Vasudeva follows Siddhartha and brings him back to their home by the river, instructing him to soothe the pain of losing his son by listening to the river.
	Siddhartha studies the river for many years, and Vasudeva teaches Siddhartha how to learn the many secrets the river has to tell. In contemplating the river, Siddhartha has a revelation: Just as the water of the river flows into the ocean and is returned by rain, all forms of life are interconnected in a cycle without beginning or end. Birth and death are all part of a timeless unity. Life and death, joy and sorrow, good and evil are all parts of the whole and are necessary to understand the meaning of life. By the time Siddhartha has learned all the river’s lessons, Vasudeva announces that he is through with his life at the river. He retires into the forest, leaving Siddhartha to be the ferryman.
	The novel ends with Govinda returning to the river to seek enlightenment by meeting with a wise man who lives there. When Govinda arrives, he does not recognize that the wise man is Siddhartha himself. Govinda is still a follower of Gotama but has yet to attain the kind of enlightenment that Siddhartha now radiates, and he asks Siddhartha to teach him what he knows. Siddhartha explains that neither he nor anyone can teach the wisdom to Govinda, because verbal explanations are limited and can never communicate the entirety of enlightenment. Instead, he asks Govinda to kiss him on the forehead, and when Govinda does, the vision of unity that Siddhartha has experienced is communicated instantly to Govinda. Govinda and Siddhartha have both finally achieved the enlightenment they set out to find in the days of their youth."
Adams,"Dinah Morris, a Methodist preacher, arrives in Hayslope, a small village in England, in 1799. She stays with her aunt and uncle, Mr. and Mrs. Poyser, although she plans to return soon to Snowfield, where she normally lives. Seth Bede, a local carpenter, loves her and is learning to live with her rejection of his marriage proposal. Seth’s brother, Adam Bede, also lives in Hayslope and works as the foreman at the carpentry shop where he and his brother work. Adam loves a seventeen-year-old village beauty named Hetty Sorrel. Hetty, who is Mr. Poyser’s niece, lives with the Poysers and helps with the chores.
Thias Bede, the father of Seth and Adam, drowns in the river near their house after a drinking binge. Their mother, Lisbeth, is distraught. Dinah goes to comfort Lisbeth, and she is able to soothe her where no one else can. Lisbeth wishes that Dinah could be her daughter-in-law.
The local landlord, Squire Donnithorne, rules the parish with an iron fist. His grandson and heir, Captain Donnithorne, who is a member of the regimental army, has broken his arm and is living with the Squire. The villagers all respect and adore Captain Donnithorne, who considers himself a gallant man. Captain Donnithorne flirts secretively with Hetty after first meeting her at the Poysers. He asks her when she will next be visiting the Squire’s residence and arranges to meet her alone in the woods when she passes through.
When Captain Donnithorne meets up with Hetty in the woods, they are alone for the first time and both are bashful. Captain Donnithorne teases Hetty about her many suitors, and she cries. He puts his arms around her, but he then immediately panics at the inappropriateness of his advances and runs off. Later Captain Donnithorne meditates on what he has done and decides he needs to see Hetty to clear up what happened. He meets her on her way back through the woods, and they kiss. This encounter begins a summer-long affair, which only ends when Captain Donnithorne leaves to rejoin his regiment. Hetty believes that Captain Donnithorne will marry her and make her into the great socialite she dreams of being. Although she does not exactly love him, she loves the wealth and privilege he represents.
Captain Donnithorne throws a coming-of-age party for himself to which he invites all the members in the parish. Everyone comes and has a wonderful time with a feast, dancing, and games. Adam discovers that Hetty is wearing a locket that Captain Donnithorne gave her. He becomes suspicious that she might have a secret lover but concludes that it would not be possible for her to conceal such a thing from the Poysers.
On the last night Captain Donnithorne is in town, Adam catches him kissing Hetty in the woods. Adam and he have a fight, which Adam wins. Captain Donnithorne lies to Adam that the affair was no more than a little flirtation. At his response, Adam tells him he must write a letter to Hetty letting her know that the affair is over. Captain Donnithorne does so, and Adam delivers the letter. Hetty is crushed, but after some time she resolves to marry Adam as a way out of her current life. Adam proposes, and Hetty accepts. By the time Captain Donnithorne leaves, Hetty is pregnant, although neither of them knows it. She resolves to go out to find Captain Donnithorne because she cannot bear to have those who know her find out about her shame. She believes that Captain Donnithorne will help her, even though she feels he can never erase her shame.
Hetty sets out to locate Captain Donnithorne. At the end of an arduous journey, she learns that he has gone to Ireland. She heads in the direction of home, more or less intending to visit Dinah, who she believes will help her without judging her. Along the way, she gives birth to her child. Distraught, she takes the child into the woods and buries it under a tree. Hetty goes away, but she cannot escape the sound of the child’s cry. She returns to where she left the baby. A farm laborer and the Stoniton constable discover her, and the constable takes her into custody for the murder of her child.
Adam is distraught when he cannot find Hetty and concludes that Captain Donnithorne must have lured her away from their upcoming marriage. Before traveling to Ireland to find him, he first goes to Mr. Irwine to inform him of his plan. Mr. Irwine tells Adam that Hetty is in jail for murder. Adam goes to her trial, even though the situation troubles him. Dinah arrives and is able to reach Hetty through her depression and convince her that she must repent to save her soul. Hetty is convicted and sentenced to die.
At the last possible moment, Captain Donnithorne arrives with a stay of execution. Hetty is transported, meaning that she is sent away from England for her crimes. She dies just before she is set to return to Hayslope. Captain Donnithorne goes away for a few years because of the shame he has brought on the Poysers and Adam. Adam realizes that he is in love with Dinah. He proposes, but she rejects him until she comes to realize that it is God’s will that she marry Adam. They are married, and they have two children. Seth lives with them and does not marry. Captain Donnithorne ultimately returns to Hayslope, and he and Adam meet one last time at the conclusion of the novel. They are able to stay friends despite all that has come between them."
Presenting,"Into the Wild contains two interconnected plots, one that involves directly represented action and another that involves the careful development of a psychological portrait of Christopher McCandless. The first plot tracks McCandless’s journey into the wild, while the second tracks the development of Krakauer’s, and, implicitly, the reader’s, understanding of McCandless’s character and motivations. Neither plot is presented in linear fashion, and the two often intersect through the presentation of subtle detail, description, and the elaboration of multiple possible lines of cause and effect. Krakauer serves as the narrator throughout the book.
Into the Wild begins with the discovery of Christopher McCandless’s body by a group of Alaskan hunters who visit Denali National Park and Preserve on a yearly excursion. They radio for help. The FBI arrives and removes the body. Krakauer then visits with Wayne Westerberg, who knew Christopher McCandless as “Alex McCandless” and who provides an initial character sketch of the young man, Krakauer in a bar in Carthage, Wisconsin. Westerberg employed McCandless on and off on his grain elevator and remembers him as engaging, intelligent, and determined. Details from McCandless’s comfortable, middle-class Virginia upbringing and his dislike of materialism further Krakauer’s understanding of the young man. These same details take the narrator back to the first leg of McCandless’s journey west in his used yellow Datsun.
Just after graduating from college, McCandless drives to Lake Mead in Nevada, where a flashflood wets the engine of the Datsun. He leaves it and a number of other possessions behind. After two months of tramping, he buys a canoe on impulse and paddles down the Colorado River to Mexico. The journey takes five months. In the meantime, the McCandless family begins investigating their son’s disappearance. After his canoeing excursion, McCandless lives and works in Bullhead City, Arizona. An old man named Charlie takes him in briefly, before McCandless departs and meets Jan Buress and her old boyfriend in California. He engages in the social life of Buress’s drifters’ camp but leaves hastily, intending to embark on his trip to Alaska. Krakauer receives a letter from and then meets Ronald Franz, who describes to Krakauer the father-son relationship he established with McCandless. The narrator uses Franz’s story to initiate a line of investigation into the harm McCandless’s risk-taking behavior caused others.
Krakauer next visits Wayne Westerberg again and reconstructs McCandless’s last month in Carthage, South Dakota by speaking with Westerberg’s girlfriend and his mother. He acquires insight into McCandless’s troubled relationship with his father and relates that in late April, 1992, McCandless sent his friends postcards revealing that he was leaving for the wild, perhaps never to return. Krakauer’s investigation then move through his revelation that many readers of his original Outdoor magazine article about McCandless thought that Christopher McCandless was an incompetent, romantic fool. In response, Krakauer embarks on the telling of the stories of three other twentieth century wilderness fanatics who disappeared or died in the wild. He evaluates each and decides that McCandless has the most in common the young artist Everett Ruess.
Back at the bus in Alaska, state troopers attempt to identify McCandless’s body. Jim Gallien reads about the finding of the corpse and then contacts the police, setting off a string of events that lead to the identification of the body. Krakauer next visits with McCandless’s family, beginning with his father, Walt McCandless, and his mother, Billie McCandless. Billie shows Krakauer photographs of Christopher’s childhood and Walt describes the heartbreak his son has caused the family. Krakauer’s investigation then picks up a new subject: McCandless’s frustration with his family. When McCandless graduated from high school, he went on a trip to California and discovered that his father had been a bigamist. Krakauer theorizes that McCandless’s anger at this long-kept family secret offers some motivation for his desire to leave his life behind.
Krakauer then dedicates two chapters to his own ascent of the Devils Thumb. These parallel the plot of McCandless’s journey. Krakauer attempts the glacier’s north face and is rebuffed, then spends three days trapped at his base camp. After accidentally setting his tent on fire, he makes a desperate attempt at the southeast face and succeeds. Recalling this story allows Krakauer conclude that Christopher McCandless must not have been suicidal when he began his trip.
Jon Krakauer’s own trip to Denali National Park and the abandoned bus where McCandless died closes out the narrative. Along with three experienced Alaskans, Krakauer crosses the same river whose flooding prevented McCandless from leaving the wild. The four hikers encounter the bus in the late evening and examine its contents. Everything seems to have been as McCandless left it. The party eats dinner and reflects on the circumstances that could have led McCandless to head into the wild. In an epilogue, the author visits the bus again with Walt and Billie McCandless, Christopher McCandless’s mother and father."
Concerns,"Lawyer Bryan Stevenson gives a first-person account of his decades helping marginalized Americans who have been unfairly and harshly punished by the U.S. criminal justice system, which disproportionately targets people of color and poor people. At the heart of Just Mercy is the story of Walter McMillian, a Black man who was framed for the murder of a girl named Ronda Morrison, convicted, and sent to death row. 
Stevenson alternates chapters about Walter with his personal reflections on our country’s history with racial disparity and issues around incarceration. Stevenson highlights other groups of vulnerable people who have been victimized by the criminal justice system and shares the stories of the prisoners he has helped over the years. The book also follows the growth of Stevenson’s nonprofit law project, the Alabama-based Equal Justice Initiative (EJI), through its expansion from focusing on death row prisoners to helping people sentenced to life without parole. Stevenson chronicles how EJI becomes a significant force in criminal justice reform.
In 1983 as a law student, Stevenson discovers his life’s passion when he interns with the Georgia-based Southern Prisoners Defense Committee and meets his first death row prisoner. After graduation Stevenson accepts a job with the organization to represent poor prisoners, including those in Alabama who lack any public defender. He meets Walter McMillian on Alabama’s death row. Walter owns a successful business but also transgresses racial boundaries when he has an affair with a white woman. Soon after the affair becomes public, the woman’s friend, Ralph Myers, accuses Walter of committing the unsolved murder of Ronda Morrison, which has outraged the community. Law enforcement, including a racist sheriff and the district attorney, eagerly pounces on this accusation, overlooking Walter’s alibi and a lack of evidence. Instead, they actively force Ralph to stick with his story even when he tries to recant. They coerce other false witness testimonies, and—as revealed years later—actively suppress evidence.
After Stevenson and the team at EJI unsuccessfully appeal Walter’s conviction, they launch their own investigation of the crime and uncover new evidence. They find witnesses who can prove the witnesses against Walter lied as well as financial records that indicate that one of these witnesses was paid to give false testimony. Stevenson and his team also petition for and receive all records from Walter’s trial. However, their big break comes when they receive a phone call from Ralph, who now wants to make amends. Ralph admits to lying about Walter and says he was threatened by law enforcement. Stevenson wins a hearing for Walter where he can present his new evidence: Ralph’s testimony, which is confirmed by health care workers and other inmates, as well as recordings of the law enforcement team threatening Ralph if he doesn’t frame Walter. 
While the judge refuses to grant Walter relief, Stevenson continues the appeal process through the Alabama courts. The district attorney asks outside agents to investigate the murder for which Walter was convicted, and the investigators determine that Walter had nothing to do with the crime. Six weeks later, the court invalidates Walter’s conviction. Stevenson and the State file a joint motion to dismiss the charges, and Walter is set free.
Throughout the process, Stevenson and Walter become close friends, and Stevenson helps Walter upon his release, including filing a civil suit on his behalf and offering him a place to stay. Walter works with Stevenson to share his story, giving interviews and speaking at legal conferences, and Walter is even featured in a documentary. Unfortunately, Walter is diagnosed with advancing dementia and is forced to rely on family and eventually a nursing facility for his care. He dies in 2013. Stevenson gives a eulogy at his funeral and shares all he learned from Walter, particularly that we must extend mercy to everyone, even those who have not earned it.
Interspersed with chapters chronicling Walter’s narrative are stories of Stevenson’s other clients and work. His closeness with these prisoners and their horrifying circumstances makes Stevenson more determined to help and causes him to reflect on abstract issues that nevertheless imbue the criminal justice system, like humanity and mercy. Stevenson focuses on several categories of vulnerable people who become trapped in the system, including mentally ill prisoners, disabled prisoners, and poor women who give birth to stillborn babies. 
Stevenson and his team at EJI also become increasingly focused on juvenile offenders who are sometimes tried as adults despite their young age. These offenders may be given de facto death sentences by being sentenced to life without parole and face perilous circumstances when they are housed in adult prisons. Stevenson illustrates how these prisoners retain their own humanity while being forced to live under inhumane conditions. He also discusses some of the qualities common among these types of prisoners: They are generally poor and disproportionately people of color, and most of them lack adequate legal counsel. The juveniles have horrific backgrounds of abuse and neglect.
Stevenson and his team at EJI also work to change the legal system to offer more protection to marginalized people. Several of his cases end up before the U.S. Supreme Court, and he succeeds in winning rulings that ban as unconstitutional the conviction of children to life without parole and the execution of people deemed incompetent from dementia or neurological disease. EJI works to raise public awareness of issues surrounding unfair incarceration, produces groundbreaking reports on racial issues, and sets up programs to help formerly incarcerated people adjust to life on the outside.
Stevenson also reflects on the issues that surround the criminal justice system. His time spent with prisoners awaiting their execution makes him realize how inhumane it is to prepare another human to die. After decades of work, when Stevenson fails to prevent the execution of a man who suffers from an intellectual disability, he momentarily feels unable to continue his work. However, he realizes that he cannot help but be broken by his experiences and comes to understand that it is his own brokenness that allows him to more fully understand the need for mercy and to bring compassion to others. The book ends with Stevenson’s renewed commitment to helping others."
Working,"In 1998, Barbara Ehrenreich, a journalist and activist then in her late 50s, sets out to document the daily struggles of America’s working poor. Having trained as a biologist, she decides to do fieldwork: in three different U.S. cities, she takes minimum-wage jobs and looks for affordable places to live. She leaves her Ph.D. and most of her skills off of her applications, to ensure that she is given the lowest-level positions available to a white, native-English speaking woman. However, she will use outside cash, if necessary, to ensure that she will never be without a car, she will not have to skip meals to save money, and she will never be homeless.
Ehrenreich’s first experiences are in Key West, Florida. Her most affordable living option, cheaper than a trailer in town, is a shabby efficiency apartment thirty miles away. Although she expects to earn $7 per hour, the first job she lands, as a diner waitress, pays much less, because she will also earn tips. The job requires not only serving tables but also additional work, like cleaning and restocking. Although Ehrenreich gets along well with her coworkers, she struggles as a waitress, because of her lack of experience. Realizing that she will not be able to stay in her apartment on what she is earning, she tries takes a second waitressing job, at another diner. She quickly realizes she will be physically unable to work both jobs, quits the first job, and takes a hotel housekeeping job next door to the second diner, instead. However, when her supervisor at the second diner yells at her, Ehrenreich has had enough and walks out.
Ehrenreich’s next location is Portland, Maine. There, after much searching, she finds a small apartment she will be able to afford. She takes two jobs. The first is with a maid service that cleans the homes of affluent clients where she works on a cleaning team with several other women. The work is back-breaking, and Ehrenreich develops a skin rash of unknown origin. She sees the other women continue to work even when they are injured or feeling sick. She notices that the cleaning techniques the team is taught to use are more about making homes look cleaner than about actually cleaning them. She learns that her employer charges customers $25 per person-hour, while she will earn $6.65 an hour. Ehrenreich’s other job is at a nursing home, where she helps serve food to residents with Alzheimer’s. The interactions with the residents are pleasant, but the cleanup work after meals is overwhelming, partly because one of the automatic dishwashers is broken.
In Minneapolis, Minnesota, finally, Ehrenreich has a very hard time finding safe, sanitary housing she can afford. A charity worker suggests that she check into a shelter while saving up first month’s rent. She has two job applications accepted, but backs out of one job, at a hardware store, when her very first shift is scheduled to last eleven hours without overtime pay. The other job is in women’s clothing at Wal-Mart. The day-long orientation for new employees includes criticism of labor unions, while the pay is less than typical for the area. The store layout is constantly changing, and customers make extra work for her by leaving unbought merchandise in other departments. The job makes Ehrenreich, by her own account, callous and spiteful. Meanwhile, she has been unable to secure a long-term rental situation. Fed up, at one of the employee meetings she starts talking about the need for a union. By now, she has already decided to quit.
Reviewing her experiences in light of the data from many different studies, Ehrenreich comes to several conclusions. She finds that workers cannot support themselves on minimum wage in America unless they work multiple jobs, and only so long as there are no unexpected expenses, such as for medical care. Ehrenreich also finds that employers try to keep information about the wages they pay from becoming general knowledge among workers. Additionally, she finds that the ways in which workers are supervised, including random urine tests for drug use, encourage the workers to accept being dehumanized. Ehrenreich adds that the attitudes found in managers of low-wage employees are based on class or racial prejudice. Finally, she states that medical benefits and child care are too expensive even for middle-class workers, let alone ones on minimum wage. She notes that perhaps someday the working poor will refuse to stop accepting their situation and will demand that things change—and concludes that the country will be a better place when they do."
Dream,"A catastrophic world war has left Earth radioactive and barely habitable. Animal life has nearly been wiped out. To encourage people to move to other planets, the U.N. supplies each emigrant with a lifelike android servant. Most people have taken the offer, but a few remain on Earth. The “regulars” can marry and travel freely. The “specials” (people who are damaged by radiation) are not allowed to reproduce or to leave Earth. Ownership of an animal is a status symbol. Some people own real ones, but others have to settle for lifelike fakes. Both regulars and specials participate in a ritual called fusion, which involves “empathy boxes” and a mysterious figure named Mercer. Through fusion, people share in Mercer’s physical sufferings and also transmit feelings to one another. Those who come to the ritual happy leave sadder, weighed down by others’ burdens. Those who enter the ritual sad have their spirits boosted by others’ happiness. The beliefs and moral teachings associated with this practice are called Mercerism.
Out on the colony planets, life is much less pleasant than advertised back on Earth. The android servants find their existence especially bleak. Some of them murder their owners and escape back to Earth, where the androids try to pass for human beings. Police departments employ bounty hunters to hunt these androids down and kill them. Before killing an android, however, a bounty hunter must use a psychological test to confirm that the target is an android. The test is believed to be reliable, but with each new model, androids are getting harder and harder to distinguish from real people. 
Rick Deckard is a bounty hunter attached to the San Francisco Police Department. One morning, he learns that a colleague was badly injured by an android. This android, plus five others on the colleague’s list, are now assigned to Rick. Rick looks forward to earning several bounties, and he starts thinking about which animal he will buy to surprise his wife. Before he can go after the androids, however, his boss orders him to visit the headquarters of Rosen Association, the manufacturer of the most realistic androids. Rick must confirm that the test to identify androids still works. 
At Rosen headquarters, Rick meets Rachael, supposedly the assistant and niece of the company president. Rick does not realize that Rachael and her uncle intend to derail Rick’s android-hunting. First, Rick is asked to use his test to decide whether Rachael is android or human. When Rachael tests as an android, the uncle persuades Rick that the test is wrong and therefore unreliable. This is a serious obstacle to any further android-hunting. Rick figures out, however, that Rachael truly is an android. Later, Rachael offers to help Rick hunt androids; being one herself, she should have useful insights into their thoughts and behavior. Rick refuses the offer. The androids he goes after use elaborate tricks to evade capture, but he persists. By the time he heads home from work, he has killed three androids and has used the bounty money to buy his wife a goat. He plans to resume the hunt the next day, but his boss calls and orders him to the location of the last three androids that same evening.
Rick changes his mind and asks Rachael for assistance. When Rick and Rachael are together, however, she seduces him. This is a tactic: nearly all other bounty hunters she slept with lost their zeal for android-hunting afterward. Rick, however, turns out to be one of the exceptions. He sends Rachael away and proceeds to his confrontation with the last three androids. They have been hiding out in the apartment of John Isidore, a special. One of the androids, Pris, is a duplicate of Rachael. Isidore is infatuated with her and in awe of android intelligence. This is the reason he is helping Pris and her two companions even though they treat him poorly. When Rick arrives, Mercer appears and warns him that Pris is lying in wait. Rick is caught off guard by Pris’s resemblance to Rachael, but he recovers and kills her. He then kills the other two androids more easily.
Rick’s hunt is over, but he feels empty and defeated. Mercerism, it was announced on TV last night, is an elaborate hoax. Rachael has taken revenge on him by killing the goat. Rick flies northward in his hovercar for hundreds of miles and sets the car down on a rocky hillside. Despondent and sleep-deprived, he experiences fusion with Mercer, even though he has no empathy box with him, and even though Mercer is supposedly not real. Rick spots a toad on the ground. Toads are listed as extinct, but against all odds Rick has stumbled on one in the wild. Excitedly, he brings the toad back to his wife. She discovers that it is only an electric toad replica, but she is grateful for the gesture. After Rick’s wife tucks him into bed for some much-needed sleep, she orders some supplies to care for the toad."
Reelection,"Alex Claremont-Diaz is the 21-year-old son of Ellen Claremont, the first female president of the United States. Alex is highly ambitious, with his sights set on a career in politics like his mother and his father, who is a US senator. Alex is finishing his last year of college and living in the White House with his family, including his older sister June. As the novel opens, June and Alex discuss the British royal wedding, which they are about to attend, and Alex talks about how much he hates the groom’s younger brother, Prince Henry. When Alex was 12, he used to look repeatedly at a photo of Henry from one of June’s teen magazines. But when he met Henry in person, Henry was rude to him, and he’s disliked Henry ever since. At the wedding, Alex is focused on Prince Henry and is irritated by everything he does, especially when he asks June to dance for a photo opportunity. Drunk, Alex confronts Henry for acting superior, and the two end up in a physical altercation that topples the $75,000 royal wedding cake. The international incident is a scandal, and Alex is forced to pretend to be Henry’s close friend to squash rumors of a shaky relationship between the United States and Britain. 
Alex has no choice but to go along with the plan. As Alex and Henry spend more time together, however, Alex is continually surprised by Henry and finds that Henry is not at all what he expected. He’s especially moved when he sees Henry speaking warmly and openly to a young girl with cancer. Before Alex can talk to Henry about it, there’s a loud noise like gunshots, and the two are rushed into a supply closet by security. In the closet, Henry ends up apologizing for mistreating Alex in the past and says he was cold to Alex because his father had just died. Alex and Henry exchange phone numbers and start texting and talking on the phone. The Claremont-Diaz clan has a family dinner, and Ellen offers both Alex and June positions in her reelection campaign. Alex is thrilled, but June, who wants to be a journalist, declines the offer. 
Alex, June, and their best friend Nora, who is the granddaughter of the Vice President, throw their annual New Year’s Eve party. Henry attends with his best friend Pez, who is enamored of June. Everyone is having fun together, but when Henry sees Alex and Nora kiss at midnight, he gets jealous and leaves the party. Alex finds him in the garden, and Henry kisses him for the first time. This spurs a crisis of sexual identity in Alex, who can’t stop thinking about the kiss. Though Alex has had a sexual relationship with his high school friend Liam and been attracted to men, he’s never considered himself bisexual. He talks to Nora about his confusion, and she says that Henry is gay, and that Alex seems to have feelings for Henry. When Henry flies in for a dinner, Alex kisses him while a security guard keeps watch. That night, they have sex for the first time, and Alex says they are friends with benefits. Henry and Alex continue to meet up to have sex when they can get away. They also begin to write flirtatious emails to each other and have heart-to-hearts on the phone. After a night on the town with June, Nora, Henry, Pez, and Henry’s sister Bea, Alex begins to develop feelings for Henry. 
Since Alex's mother is running for reelection and because Henry is a royal, it’s crucial that Henry and Alex’s relationship remain a secret. Alex often turns to his mentor and family friend, Senator Rafael Luna, for advice to help his mother with her campaign. It’s a blow to the whole family when Luna comes out as the running mate for Ellen’s opponent, Jeffrey Richards. Alex is devastated, and Henry comes to visit Alex at the Democratic National Convention to comfort him. The next morning, Zahra, Ellen’s chief of staff and family friend, catches Henry and Alex together and agrees to keep it a secret until after the convention. Alex comes out to his mother, who creates a PowerPoint presentation as a means of talking about the dangers of his relationship with Henry. She tells him she’ll support him, but he needs to be sure the relationship is forever. He goes to his family’s lake house with Henry, June, Nora, and his father Oscar. Alex comes out to his father, too, and he realizes that he is in love with Henry. Just as he’s about to tell Henry how he feels, Henry suddenly becomes formal and fake and leaves the conversation. The next morning Henry leaves the lake house without saying goodbye, leaving only a note. 
When Henry stops responding to Alex’s texts, Alex is distraught. He flies to London to confront Henry. Henry says he can’t be in a relationship with Alex because of the royal family. They have sex, and neither of them is sure whether it is a goodbye or the beginning of their relationship. Henry gives Alex his signet ring and says he wants to be with Alex. They are happy to be together, and they send each other passionate emails when they are apart.
Suspicions about their relationship start coming out in the press, so Alex and Henry pretend to go on dates with Nora and June. It’s painful for Henry to pretend to be someone he isn’t. Then, Akex and Henry's relationship is leaked to the press, with photos of them together and their entire email history. They are both forced to go on a communication blackout, and Ellen’s team attempts to triage the situation. Alex is miserable and worried about Henry. Eventually, he flies to London. Alex and Bea help Henry confront his family, including his grandmother, the Queen. As the Queen argues that the world will never accept them, a group of people gathers outside the palace to express support for Alex and Henry’s love.  
Nora, who has been missing since the news of Alex and Henry’s relationship broke, emerges and reveals that it was the Richards campaign that leaked their photographs and emails. Alex figures out that it was Luna who tipped them off. Alex talks to Luna, and Luna reveals that Richards sexually assaulted him when he was his intern. Luna joined the campaign to expose Richards as a sexual predator. Election night is tense, and in the end, whoever wins Texas, Ellen’s home state, will win the election. Ellen wins, and Henry joins Alex onstage for her victory lap. The two leave the party and go to Alex’s house. Alex shows Henry where he grew up, letting them in with the key he always wears around his neck."
Indispensable,"Jack Worthing, the play’s protagonist, is a pillar of the community in Hertfordshire, where he is guardian to Cecily Cardew, the pretty, eighteen-year-old granddaughter of the late Thomas Cardew, who found and adopted Jack when he was a baby. In Hertfordshire, Jack has responsibilities: he is a major landowner and justice of the peace, with tenants, farmers, and a number of servants and other employees all dependent on him. For years, he has also pretended to have an irresponsible black-sheep brother named Ernest who leads a scandalous life in pursuit of pleasure and is always getting into trouble of a sort that requires Jack to rush grimly off to his assistance. In fact, Ernest is merely Jack’s alibi, a phantom that allows him to disappear for days at a time and do as he likes. No one but Jack knows that he himself is Ernest. Ernest is the name Jack goes by in London, which is where he really goes on these occasions—probably to pursue the very sort of behavior he pretends to disapprove of in his imaginary brother.
Jack is in love with Gwendolen Fairfax, the cousin of his best friend, Algernon Moncrieff. When the play opens, Algernon, who knows Jack as Ernest, has begun to suspect something, having found an inscription inside Jack’s cigarette case addressed to “Uncle Jack” from someone who refers to herself as “little Cecily.” Algernon suspects that Jack may be leading a double life, a practice he seems to regard as commonplace and indispensable to modern life. He calls a person who leads a double life a “Bunburyist,” after a nonexistent friend he pretends to have, a chronic invalid named Bunbury, to whose deathbed he is forever being summoned whenever he wants to get out of some tiresome social obligation.
At the beginning of Act 1, Jack drops in unexpectedly on Algernon and announces that he intends to propose to Gwendolen. Algernon confronts him with the cigarette case and forces him to come clean, demanding to know who “Jack” and “Cecily” are. Jack confesses that his name isn’t really Ernest and that Cecily is his ward, a responsibility imposed on him by his adoptive father’s will. Jack also tells Algernon about his fictional brother. Jack says he’s been thinking of killing off this fake brother, since Cecily has been showing too active an interest in him. Without meaning to, Jack describes Cecily in terms that catch Algernon’s attention and make him even more interested in her than he is already.
Gwendolen and her mother, Lady Bracknell, arrive, which gives Jack an opportunity to propose to Gwendolen. Jack is delighted to discover that Gwendolen returns his affections, but he is alarmed to learn that Gwendolen is fixated on the name Ernest, which she says “inspires absolute confidence.” Gwendolen makes clear that she would not consider marrying a man who was not named Ernest.
Lady Bracknell interviews Jack to determine his eligibility as a possible son-in-law, and during this interview she asks about his family background. When Jack explains that he has no idea who his parents were and that he was found, by the man who adopted him, in a handbag in the cloakroom at Victoria Station, Lady Bracknell is scandalized. She forbids the match between Jack and Gwendolen and sweeps out of the house.
In Act 2, Algernon shows up at Jack’s country estate posing as Jack’s brother Ernest. Meanwhile, Jack, having decided that Ernest has outlived his usefulness, arrives home in deep mourning, full of a story about Ernest having died suddenly in Paris. He is enraged to find Algernon there masquerading as Ernest but has to go along with the charade. If he doesn’t, his own lies and deceptions will be revealed.
While Jack changes out of his mourning clothes, Algernon, who has fallen hopelessly in love with Cecily, asks her to marry him. He is surprised to discover that Cecily already considers that they are engaged, and he is charmed when she reveals that her fascination with “Uncle Jack’s brother” led her to invent an elaborate romance between herself and him several months ago. Algernon is less enchanted to learn that part of Cecily’s interest in him derives from the name Ernest, which, unconsciously echoing Gwendolen, she says “inspires absolute confidence.”
Algernon goes off in search of Dr. Chasuble, the local rector, to see about getting himself christened Ernest. Meanwhile, Gwendolen arrives, having decided to pay Jack an unexpected visit. Gwendolen is shown into the garden, where Cecily orders tea and attempts to play hostess. Cecily has no idea how Gwendolen figures into Jack’s life, and Gwendolen, for her part, has no idea who Cecily is. Gwendolen initially thinks Cecily is a visitor to the Manor House and is disconcerted to learn that Cecily is “Mr. Worthing’s ward.” She notes that Ernest has never mentioned having a ward, and Cecily explains that it is not Ernest Worthing who is her guardian but his brother Jack and, in fact, that she is engaged to be married to Ernest Worthing. Gwendolen points out that this is impossible as she herself is engaged to Ernest Worthing. The tea party degenerates into a war of manners.
Jack and Algernon arrive toward the climax of this confrontation, each having separately made arrangements with Dr. Chasuble to be christened Ernest later that day. Each of the young ladies points out that the other has been deceived: Cecily informs Gwendolen that her fiancé is really named Jack and Gwendolen informs Cecily that hers is really called Algernon. The two women demand to know where Jack’s brother Ernest is, since both of them are engaged to be married to him. Jack is forced to admit that he has no brother and that Ernest is a complete fiction. Both women are shocked and furious, and they retire to the house arm in arm.
Act 3 takes place in the drawing room of the Manor House, where Cecily and Gwendolen have retired. When Jack and Algernon enter from the garden, the two women confront them. Cecily asks Algernon why he pretended to be her guardian’s brother. Algernon tells her he did it in order to meet her. Gwendolen asks Jack whether he pretended to have a brother in order to come into London to see her as often as possible, and she interprets his evasive reply as an affirmation. The women are somewhat appeased but still concerned over the issue of the name. However, when Jack and Algernon tell Gwendolen and Cecily that they have both made arrangements to be christened Ernest that afternoon, all is forgiven and the two pairs of lovers embrace. At this moment, Lady Bracknell’s arrival is announced.
Lady Bracknell has followed Gwendolen from London, having bribed Gwendolen’s maid to reveal her destination. She demands to know what is going on. Gwendolen again informs Lady Bracknell of her engagement to Jack, and Lady Bracknell reiterates that a union between them is out of the question. Algernon tells Lady Bracknell of his engagement to Cecily, prompting her to inspect Cecily and inquire into her social connections, which she does in a routine and patronizing manner that infuriates Jack. He replies to all her questions with a mixture of civility and sarcasm, withholding until the last possible moment the information that Cecily is actually worth a great deal of money and stands to inherit still more when she comes of age. At this, Lady Bracknell becomes genuinely interested.
Jack informs Lady Bracknell that, as Cecily’s legal guardian, he refuses to give his consent to her union with Algernon. Lady Bracknell suggests that the two young people simply wait until Cecily comes of age, and Jack points out that under the terms of her grandfather’s will, Cecily does not legally come of age until she is thirty-five. Lady Bracknell asks Jack to reconsider, and he points out that the matter is entirely in her own hands. As soon as she consents to his marriage to Gwendolen, Cecily can have his consent to marry Algernon. However, Lady Bracknell refuses to entertain the notion. She and Gwendolen are on the point of leaving when Dr. Chasuble arrives and happens to mention Cecily’s governess, Miss Prism. At this, Lady Bracknell starts and asks that Miss Prism be sent for.
When the governess arrives and catches sight of Lady Bracknell, she begins to look guilty and furtive. Lady Bracknell accuses her of having left her sister’s house twenty-eight years before with a baby and never returned. She demands to know where the baby is. Miss Prism confesses she doesn’t know, explaining that she lost the baby, having absentmindedly placed it in a handbag in which she had meant to place the manuscript for a novel she had written. Jack asks what happened to the bag, and Miss Prism says she left it in the cloakroom of a railway station. Jack presses her for further details and goes racing offstage, returning a few moments later with a large handbag. When Miss Prism confirms that the bag is hers, Jack throws himself on her with a cry of “Mother!” It takes a while before the situation is sorted out, but before too long we understand that Jack is not the illegitimate child of Miss Prism but the legitimate child of Lady Bracknell’s sister and, therefore, Algernon’s older brother. Furthermore, Jack had been originally christened “Ernest John.” All these years Jack has unwittingly been telling the truth: Ernest is his name, as is Jack, and he does have an unprincipled younger brother—Algernon. Again the couples embrace, Miss Prism and Dr. Chasuble follow suit, and Jack acknowledges that he now understands “the vital Importance of Being Earnest.”"
Discard,"As a flute melody plays, Willy Loman returns to his home in Brooklyn one night, exhausted from a failed sales trip. His wife, Linda, tries to persuade him to ask his boss, Howard Wagner, to let him work in New York so that he won’t have to travel. Willy says that he will talk to Howard the next day. Willy complains that Biff, his older son who has come back home to visit, has yet to make something of himself. Linda scolds Willy for being so critical, and Willy goes to the kitchen for a snack.
As Willy talks to himself in the kitchen, Biff and his younger brother, Happy, who is also visiting, reminisce about their adolescence and discuss their father’s babbling, which often includes criticism of Biff’s failure to live up to Willy’s expectations. As Biff and Happy, dissatisfied with their lives, fantasize about buying a ranch out West, Willy becomes immersed in a daydream. He praises his sons, now younger, who are washing his car. The young Biff, a high school football star, and the young Happy appear. They interact affectionately with their father, who has just returned from a business trip. Willy confides in Biff and Happy that he is going to open his own business one day, bigger than that owned by his neighbor, Charley. Charley’s son, Bernard, enters looking for Biff, who must study for math class in order to avoid failing. Willy points out to his sons that although Bernard is smart, he is not “well liked,” which will hurt him in the long run.
A younger Linda enters, and the boys leave to do some chores. Willy boasts of a phenomenally successful sales trip, but Linda coaxes him into revealing that his trip was actually only meagerly successful. Willy complains that he soon won’t be able to make all of the payments on their appliances and car. He complains that people don’t like him and that he’s not good at his job. As Linda consoles him, he hears the laughter of his mistress. He approaches The Woman, who is still laughing, and engages in another reminiscent daydream. Willy and The Woman flirt, and she thanks him for giving her stockings.
The Woman disappears, and Willy fades back into his prior daydream, in the kitchen. Linda, now mending stockings, reassures him. He scolds her mending and orders her to throw the stockings out. Bernard bursts in, again looking for Biff. Linda reminds Willy that Biff has to return a football that he stole, and she adds that Biff is too rough with the neighborhood girls. Willy hears The Woman laugh and explodes at Bernard and Linda. Both leave, and though the daydream ends, Willy continues to mutter to himself. The older Happy comes downstairs and tries to quiet Willy. Agitated, Willy shouts his regret about not going to Alaska with his brother, Ben, who eventually found a diamond mine in Africa and became rich. Charley, having heard the commotion, enters. Happy goes off to bed, and Willy and Charley begin to play cards. Charley offers Willy a job, but Willy, insulted, refuses it. As they argue, Willy imagines that Ben enters. Willy accidentally calls Charley Ben. Ben inspects Willy’s house and tells him that he has to catch a train soon to look at properties in Alaska. As Willy talks to Ben about the prospect of going to Alaska, Charley, seeing no one there, gets confused and questions Willy. Willy yells at Charley, who leaves. The younger Linda enters and Ben meets her. Willy asks Ben impatiently about his life. Ben recounts his travels and talks about their father. As Ben is about to leave, Willy daydreams further, and Charley and Bernard rush in to tell him that Biff and Happy are stealing lumber. Although Ben eventually leaves, Willy continues to talk to him.
Back in the present, the older Linda enters to find Willy outside. Biff and Happy come downstairs and discuss Willy’s condition with their mother. Linda scolds Biff for judging Willy harshly. Biff tells her that he knows Willy is a fake, but he refuses to elaborate. Linda mentions that Willy has tried to commit suicide. Happy grows angry and rebukes Biff for his failure in the business world. Willy enters and yells at Biff. Happy intervenes and eventually proposes that he and Biff go into the sporting goods business together. Willy immediately brightens and gives Biff a host of tips about asking for a loan from one of Biff’s old employers, Bill Oliver. After more arguing and reconciliation, everyone finally goes to bed.
Act II opens with Willy enjoying the breakfast that Linda has made for him. Willy ponders the bright-seeming future before getting angry again about his expensive appliances. Linda informs Willy that Biff and Happy are taking him out to dinner that night. Excited, Willy announces that he is going to make Howard Wagner give him a New York job. The phone rings, and Linda chats with Biff, reminding him to be nice to his father at the restaurant that night.
As the lights fade on Linda, they come up on Howard playing with a wire recorder in his office. Willy tries to broach the subject of working in New York, but Howard interrupts him and makes him listen to his kids and wife on the wire recorder. When Willy finally gets a word in, Howard rejects his plea. Willy launches into a lengthy recalling of how a legendary salesman named Dave Singleman inspired him to go into sales. Howard leaves and Willy gets angry. Howard soon re-enters and tells Willy to take some time off. Howard leaves and Ben enters, inviting Willy to join him in Alaska. The younger Linda enters and reminds Willy of his sons and job. The young Biff enters, and Willy praises Biff’s prospects and the fact that he is well liked.
Ben leaves and Bernard rushes in, eagerly awaiting Biff’s big football game. Willy speaks optimistically to Biff about the game. Charley enters and teases Willy about the game. As Willy chases Charley off, the lights rise on a different part of the stage. Willy continues yelling from offstage, and Jenny, Charley’s secretary, asks a grown-up Bernard to quiet him down. Willy enters and prattles on about a “very big deal” that Biff is working on. Daunted by Bernard’s success (he mentions to Willy that he is going to Washington to fight a case), Willy asks Bernard why Biff turned out to be such a failure. Bernard asks Willy what happened in Boston that made Biff decide not to go to summer school. Willy defensively tells Bernard not to blame him.
Charley enters and sees Bernard off. When Willy asks for more money than Charley usually loans him, Charley again offers Willy a job. Willy again refuses and eventually tells Charley that he was fired. Charley scolds Willy for always needing to be liked and angrily gives him the money. Calling Charley his only friend, Willy exits on the verge of tears.
At Frank’s Chop House, Happy helps Stanley, a waiter, prepare a table. They ogle and chat up a girl, Miss Forsythe, who enters the restaurant. Biff enters, and Happy introduces him to Miss Forsythe, continuing to flirt with her. Miss Forsythe, a call girl, leaves to telephone another call girl (at Happy’s request), and Biff spills out that he waited six hours for Bill Oliver and Oliver didn’t even recognize him. Upset at his father’s unrelenting misconception that he, Biff, was a salesman for Oliver, Biff plans to relieve Willy of his illusions. Willy enters, and Biff tries gently, at first, to tell him what happened at Oliver’s office. Willy blurts out that he was fired. Stunned, Biff again tries to let Willy down easily. Happy cuts in with remarks suggesting Biff’s success, and Willy eagerly awaits the good news.
Biff finally explodes at Willy for being unwilling to listen. The young Bernard runs in shouting for Linda, and Biff, Happy, and Willy start to argue. As Biff explains what happened, their conversation recedes into the background. The young Bernard tells Linda that Biff failed math. The restaurant conversation comes back into focus and Willy criticizes Biff for failing math. Willy then hears the voice of the hotel operator in Boston and shouts that he is not in his room. Biff scrambles to quiet Willy and claims that Oliver is talking to his partner about giving Biff the money. Willy’s renewed interest and probing questions irk Biff more, and he screams at Willy. Willy hears The Woman laugh and he shouts back at Biff, hitting him and staggering. Miss Forsythe enters with another call girl, Letta. Biff helps Willy to the washroom and, finding Happy flirting with the girls, argues with him about Willy. Biff storms out, and Happy follows with the girls.
Willy and The Woman enter, dressing themselves and flirting. The door knocks and Willy hurries The Woman into the bathroom. Willy answers the door; the young Biff enters and tells Willy that he failed math. Willy tries to usher him out of the room, but Biff imitates his math teacher’s lisp, which elicits laughter from Willy and The Woman. Willy tries to cover up his indiscretion, but Biff refuses to believe his stories and storms out, dejected, calling Willy a “phony little fake.” Back in the restaurant, Stanley helps Willy up. Willy asks him where he can find a seed store. Stanley gives him directions to one, and Willy hurries off.
The light comes up on the Loman kitchen, where Happy enters looking for Willy. He moves into the living room and sees Linda. Biff comes inside and Linda scolds the boys and slaps away the flowers in Happy’s hand. She yells at them for abandoning Willy. Happy attempts to appease her, but Biff goes in search of Willy. He finds Willy planting seeds in the garden with a flashlight. Willy is consulting Ben about a $20,000 proposition. Biff approaches him to say goodbye and tries to bring him inside. Willy moves into the house, followed by Biff, and becomes angry again about Biff’s failure. Happy tries to calm Biff, but Biff and Willy erupt in fury at each other. Biff starts to sob, which touches Willy. Everyone goes to bed except Willy, who renews his conversation with Ben, elated at how great Biff will be with $20,000 of insurance money. Linda soon calls out for Willy but gets no response. Biff and Happy listen as well. They hear Willy’s car speed away.
In the requiem, Linda and Happy stand in shock after Willy’s poorly attended funeral. Biff states that Willy had the wrong dreams. Charley defends Willy as a victim of his profession. Ready to leave, Biff invites Happy to go back out West with him. Happy declares that he will stick it out in New York to validate Willy’s death. Linda asks Willy for forgiveness for being unable to cry. She begins to sob, repeating “We’re free. . . .” All exit, and the flute melody is heard as the curtain falls."
Bridge,"Jess Aarons is an eleven-year-old boy living in a rural area of the South who loves to run. He dreams of being the fastest boy in the fifth grade when school starts up in the fall, feeling that this will for once give him a chance to stand in the spotlight among his five sisters, and might win him the attention of his preoccupied father. Jess is quite insecure in his identity. He loves to paint and draw, but he knows very well that this labels him a ""sissy"" in the eyes of most of the world, particularly his father. In addition, his family is stretched so tight by poverty that he has little chance to really explore his own identity during this crucial period of adolescence. He has therefore built up the importance of winning in his mind, feeling that here, at least, is something that he is good at which won't win him an undesired label of ""sissy"" or ""girl"" in the eyes of his father or schoolmates, and which will allow him to shine in his own right. He practices each morning, always dreaming of his upcoming victory. However, when the races come around at recess, a new girl, Leslie Burke, who just moved next door to Jess, boldly crosses to the boys' side of the playground and beats everyone.
A rather unpromising beginning, but Jess and Leslie become fast friends. They build a secret fantasyland across the creek in the woods, called Terabithia, where they play all the time. There they forget the rest of the world, such as the kids at school or Jess's less-than-satisfactory family. The time they spend in Terabithia, in fact, seems to strengthen them for these trials of everyday life: it is there that they map out a plan of revenge on the school bully when she steals May Belle's Twinkies, and it is there that they discuss Jess's feelings of insecurity when Leslie begins to draw closer to her father. Leslie also introduces Jess to the world of imagination and creativity, telling him the stories of such classics of literature as 
Moby Dick
 and 
Hamlet
. All this also strengthens Jess's artistic talent and ability, as Leslie supports his ambition and, through the stories she tells, provides him with great subject matter. But much of the time they play wonderful games of their own invention—defeating intruders on Terabithian territory, praying to the Spirits of the Grove to end a long spell of rain, and numerous other fantasies.
However, Jess and Leslie's friendship, though centered in Terabithia, is not limited to Terabithia. They see each other at school, where they take a good deal of ribbing for their cross-gender friendship, but by now that sort of teasing has lost the power to hurt Jess, and Leslie has never been particularly bothered by what others think. At home, they celebrate holidays together, such as Christmas, when Jess gives Leslie a puppy and she gives him an expensive art set to develop his artistic talent, and Easter, when Leslie goes to church for the first time with Jess. Leslie is impressed by the beauty of the story of Christ. Jess and his little sister May Belle, cowed by negative and unforgiving religious training, are convinced that nonbelievers such as Leslie are doomed to hell, and find the whole experience disturbing. Nevertheless, Jess and Leslie remain the best of friends, and Jess finds a purpose in his life through Leslie's company that he's never had before.
One day the music teacher at school, Miss Edmunds, whom Jess has long had a crush on, invites him to spend a day with her touring the art galleries in Washington. This trip does much to expand his mind and make him feel as if he is special, a feeling he has previously only had in Leslie's company. Jess has a perfect day, but when he gets home he is told that Leslie drowned in the creek that morning trying to swing into Terabithia on the rope that they used for that purpose. Jess is completely devastated and goes through the stages of grief—denial, anger, fear, and sorrow—all incredibly painful to suffer and, indeed, to read about. Initially, he does not see how he is to go on initially. Leslie has raised him to new heights as the king of Terabithia, and now he feels that without her, he has no choice but to revert to the old Jess, plagued by fear and insecurity. However, eventually he realizes that he can only keep Leslie's memory, and his own newfound sense of self, alive by continuing the fantasy of Terabithia. He brings his little sister May Belle there and makes her its new queen, assuring that a part of Leslie will live on as well."
Treasureâ,"Jim Hawkins is a young boy who lives at his parents’ inn, the Admiral Benbow, near Bristol, England, in the eighteenth century. An old sea captain named Billy Bones dies in the inn after being presented with a black spot, or official pirate verdict of guilt or judgment. Jim is stirred to action by the spot and its mysterious, accurate portent of Billy’s death. Hastily, Jim and his mother unlock Billy’s sea chest, finding a logbook and map inside. Hearing steps outside, they leave with the documents before Billy’s pursuers ransack the inn.
Jim realizes that the contents he has snatched from the sea chest must be valuable, so he takes one of the documents he has found to some local acquaintances, Dr. Livesey and Squire Trelawney. Excited, they recognize it as a map for a huge treasure that the infamous pirate Captain Flint has buried on a distant island. Trelawney immediately starts planning an expedition. Naïve in his negotiations to outfit his ship, the Hispaniola, Trelawney is tricked into hiring one of Flint’s former mates, Long John Silver, and many of Flint’s crew. Only the captain, Smollett, is trustworthy. The ship sets sail for Treasure Island with nothing amiss, until Jim overhears Silver’s plans for mutiny. Jim tells the captain about Silver and the rest of the rebellious crew.
Landing at the island, Captain Smollett devises a plan to get most of the mutineers off the ship, allowing them leisure time on shore. On a whim, Jim sneaks into the pirates’ boat and goes ashore with them. Frightened of the pirates, Jim runs off alone. From a hiding place, he witnesses Silver’s murder of a sailor who refuses to join the mutiny. Jim flees deeper into the heart of the island, where he encounters a half-crazed man named Ben Gunn. Ben had once served in Flint’s crew but was marooned on the island years earlier.
Meanwhile, Smollett and his men have gone ashore and taken shelter in a stockade the pirates have built. Jim returns to the stockade, bringing Ben with him. Silver visits and attempts a negotiation with the captain, but the captain is wary and refuses to speak to him. The pirates attack the stockade the next day, and the captain is wounded. Eager to take action, Jim follows another whim and deserts his mates, sneaking off to hunt for Ben’s handmade boat hidden in the woods.
After finding Ben’s boat, Jim sails out to the anchored ship with the intention of cutting it adrift, thereby depriving the pirates of a means of escape. He cuts the rope, but he realizes his small boat has drifted near the pirates’ camp and fears he will be discovered. By chance, the pirates do not spot Jim, and he floats around the island until he catches sight of the ship drifting wildly. Struggling aboard, he discovers that one of the watchmen, Israel Hands, has killed the other watchman in a drunken fit. Jim takes control of the ship, but Israel turns against him. Jim is wounded but kills Israel.
Jim returns to the stockade but finds it occupied by the pirates. Silver takes Jim hostage, telling the boy that the captain has given the pirates the treasure map, provisions, and the use of the stockade in exchange for their lives. Jim realizes, however, that Silver is having trouble managing his men, who accuse him of treachery. Silver proposes to Jim that they help each other survive by pretending Jim is a hostage. However, the men present Silver with a black spot and inform him that he has been deposed as their commander.
In a desperate attempt to gain control of his crew, Silver shows them the treasure map to appease them. Silver leads Jim and the men to the treasure site, but they are shocked to find it already excavated and the treasure removed. The men are angered and near mutiny again. At that moment Dr. Livesey, Ben Gunn, and the others fire on the pirate band, which scatters throughout the island. Jim and Silver flee, and are guided by the others to Ben’s cave, where Ben has hidden the treasure, which he had discovered months before.
After spending three days carrying the loot to the ship, the men prepare to set sail for home. There is a debate about the fate of the remaining mutineers. Despite the pirates’ submissive pleas, they are left marooned on the island. Silver is allowed to join the voyage, but he sneaks off the ship one night with a portion of the treasure and is never heard from again. The voyage home comes to a close. Eventually, Captain Smollet retires from the sea, and Ben becomes a lodge-keeper. Jim swears off treasure-hunting forever and suffers from nightmares about the sea and gold coins."
Untamed,"O Pioneers! opens on a blustery winter day, in the town of Hanover, Nebraska, sometime between 1883 and 1890. The narrator introduces four principal characters: the very young Emil Bergson; his stalwart older sister, Alexandra; her gloomy friend Carl Linstrum; and a pretty little Bohemian child, Marie Shabata. From town, Emil and Alexandra and their neighbor Carl return home to the desolate stretch of plains known as the Divide. Alexandra's father, John Bergson, is dying. He tells his two eldest sons, Oscar and Lou, that he is entrusting the farmland, and the preservation of all that he has accomplished since his immigration from Sweden, to his daughter.
It becomes clear that Alexandra is stronger and more resolute than her brothers. When drought and depression strike three years later, Alexandra's determination allows her to persevere. Many families, including Carl Linstrum's, sell their farms and move away. But Alexandra believes in the promise of the untamed country, and so she convinces her brothers to re-mortgage their farm and buy more land. She also convinces them to adopt innovative farming techniques.
The narrative jumps sixteen years into the future, when Alexandra's faith in the land has been repaid. Lou and Oscar are married, and each owns his own farm. Alexandra's farm is the most prosperous on the Divide. Emil has been provided the wealth and luxury to leave the Divide for the State University. Crazy Ivar, the elderly, slightly imbalanced man who, earlier in the novel, gave Alexandra some controversial farming advice, now works in Alexandra's stables, although Lou and Oscar disapprove of his presence. Amid this underlying tension, Carl Linstrum returns for a long visit after years of travel. /PARAGRAPH. Meanwhile, Marie Shabata is trapped in an unhappy marriage with a sullen and difficult husband, and it becomes clear that she and Emil are falling in love. Emil decides to travel to Mexico City, fleeing the temptation that Marie presents. Alexandra and Carl slowly regain their teenage intimacy. In reaction, Lou and Oscar drive Carl out of town, fearing that his relationship with Alexandra might threaten their own children's prospects of inheriting Alexandra's farm.
Emil returns from Mexico nearly a year later, only to find that his love for Marie has grown during their separation. Once again, he resolves to flee the Divide. Before he can leave, though, tragedy strikes: his best friend, Amedee, dies unexpectedly. At a church mass, Emil enters a state of rapture and resolves to say farewell to Marie. He finds her in a similar ecstasy in her orchard, and he lies down next to her. Her jealous husband, Frank Shabata, finds them. Blinded by fury, he shoots them both dead.
Months after the murders, Alexandra Bergson has achieved some limited recovery from her sorrow; she now possesses a stoic exhaustion with life. She resolves to try to win a pardon for Frank, who is serving a ten-year sentence in a Lincoln jail. Returning from a visit to Frank in Lincoln, she finds Carl Linstrum waiting for her. As soon as he heard of Emil's death, he returned from Alaska. They find comfort and companionship in each other, and they decide to marry."
Cast,"The body of Chase Andrews is found by two boys next to an abandoned fire tower in the swamp on October 30, 1969.
In 1952, six-year-old Kya watches her mother leave their shack in the marsh. Before long, her siblings, including her beloved 12-year-old brother Jodie, depart too, leaving Kya alone with Pa, a drunken, disabled World War II vet prone to violent rages. Pa gives Kya a dollar a week for food. In town, older boys, including Chase Andrews, pass her on their bikes. Kya spends most of her time in the marsh with the gulls.
Mrs. Culpepper, a truant officer, takes Kya to school, where she is humiliated and never returns. Over the years, townspeople call her “dirty,” “the Marsh Girl,” “Missing Link,” and “marsh trash.”
Kya takes Pa’s fishing boat exploring. When she gets lost, one of Jodie’s friends, Tate Walker, guides her back to her channel. Tate lives alone in town with his dad, Scupper, a fisherman. 
For a while, Kya and Pa fish together and enjoy each other’s company. Pa introduces Kya to Jumpin’, an older Black man who sells gas and supplies. Kya’s mother sends a letter, but Pa burns it and returns to drinking. Pa finally disappears when Kya is ten years old. Kya supports herself selling mussels to Jumpin’, whose wife Mabel collects clothes for Kya from Colored Town. Kya continues watching Tate as well as Chase and his friends.
When she is 14 years old, Kya finds a series of special feathers left in a tree stump in the marsh. One day, she leaves a special feather in return. After that, Tate appears at the stump and offers to teach her to read. Tate and Kya begin to meet at a secret cabin in the marsh where he teaches her to read. As Kya matures, Tate brings her a biology textbook and Mabel gives her a bra. One day Tate finds Kya sick on Point Beach. He explains to her that she is having her period. Kya and Tate continue their lessons and she invites him inside her shack and shows him her collection of natural objects. One day, Tate kisses Kya and they begin a romantic relationship. Their desire grows but they avoid having sex. Tate leaves early for college and tells Kya he will visit on the 4th of July. However, he doesn’t return. Kya, devastated, returns to studying nature.
When Kya is 19 years old, Chase catches her eye on Point Beach. He is a popular, good looking, confident, former high school quarterback. Chase approaches Kya on Jumpin’s wharf and invites her on a picnic. 
At the picnic, Chase gives Kya a rare scallop shell. He is sexually aggressive and she runs away. When Kya and Chase meet ten days later, he apologizes and takes her to see the abandoned fire tower. Kya gives Chase a necklace made from the scallop shell. Chase says he won’t approach her sexually unless she wants him to.
Kya gets closer to Chase. Tate, who is home from college, wants to apologize to Kya, but sees her kissing Chase and turns away. Chase starts talking about marriage and invites Kya on an overnight trip. She joins him and they have unsatisfying sex in a cheap motel room. Still, their relationship continues. However, Chase won’t introduce Kya to his parents or friends and disappears for a week over Christmas. 
Tate comes to the lagoon to warn Kya that Chase is seeing other women, but she throws rocks at him. Still, she invites him into the shack and he offers to find a publisher for a book of her nature paintings. 
Kya sees the engagement announcement in the newspaper for Chase and Pearl, a girl she recognizes from Point Beach. She recites poems by Amanda Hamilton, who publishes in the local newspaper, to soothe herself. She determines to live her life alone.
A year later, Kya receives a copy of her first book. She uses the advance money to improve and modernize the shack. She gives Tate a copy of her book. 
Kya’s brother Jodie visits the shack. He tells her that Ma has died and promises to keep in touch. He encourages her to reconcile with Tate.
In August of 1969, Chase sneaks up on Kya on a remote beach, attacks and tries to rape her. She fights him off and sees two fishermen watching from their boat as she leaves. Tate and Jumpin’ see her bruises, but she begs them not to tell anyone. Chase continues to come to her shack, but she hides from him. Kya gets a letter from her publisher, Robert Foster, to meet him in Greenville. She finds out from Tate how to buy a bus ticket and goes to meet him on October 28, returning on October 30, the day Chase’s body is found.
Sheriff Ed Jackson and his deputy Joe Perdue investigate Chase’s death. No footprints or fingerprints are found at the scene. They think Chase was pushed through an open gate and the murderer covered up the scene. Almost immediately, everyone in town suspects “the Marsh Girl.” 
Over time, Joe and Ed’s main clue consists of red wool fibers on Chase’s jacket. Also, Chase’s mother Patti Love tells them Chase was wearing the shell necklace when he left her house that night, but it was not found at the scene. A shrimper, Hal Miller, tells them he saw Kya’s boat headed toward the fire tower the night Chase died. However, Tate and Jumpin’ and townspeople who saw her get on and off the bus to Greenville give Kya an alibi. A fisherman, Rodney Horn, who heard Kya yelling and saw her leaving after Chase attacked her, heard her say she would kill Chase if he bothered her again. Joe and Ed find a red wool hat in Kya’s shack that Tate gave her and that matches the fibers on Chase’s coat. With this information, they arrest Kya for murder.
Kya spends two months in jail awaiting trial. A lawyer, Tom Milton, volunteers to defend her. 
A kind guard at the prison, Jacob, lets the cat, Sunday Justice, into her cell for company. Tate, Jumpin’, and Mabel sit behind Kya in court for support. They are later joined by Jodie, Robert Foster, and Scupper. 
Prosecutor Eric Chastain calls his witnesses and Tom Milton counters their testimony. The jury learns that it would have been possible for Kya to take buses back and forth from Greenville on the night of the murder, but the timing is very tight. Tom calls defense witnesses, including Kya’s publisher Robert Foster. After closing statements, everyone awaits the verdict. Kya is found not guilty. Jodie takes her home, where she is delighted to see the marsh again. 
Kya sees Tate in his boat and is going to approach him, but the sheriff and two deputies arrive and take Tate with them. She learns that Scupper has had a stroke and died.
The day after Scupper’s funeral, Tate finds a feather in his boat from Kya. At the shack, they express their love for each other and Tate moves in with her. Over the years, Jumpin’ dies, and Jodie and his wife and children visit the shack. Tate works at the nearby lab and Kya writes seven more books. 
One day Tate finds Kya in her boat, dead of a heart attack at age 64. On her tombstone, he inscribes “The Marsh Girl.” Many townspeople come to Kya’s funeral on her land. That night, Tate finds two items beneath the floorboards. One is a box of poems by Amanda Hamilton, a pseudonym Kya used, including a poem describing Chase Andrews’ death. Tate also finds the shell necklace Kya gave Chase. Tate burns the poems and rawhide cord and crushes the shell on the beach for the tide to take away."
Sensibly,"When Mr. Henry Dashwood dies, leaving all his money to his first wife's son John Dashwood, his second wife and her three daughters are left with no permanent home and very little income. Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters (Elinor, Marianne, and Margaret) are invited to stay with their distant relations, the Middletons, at Barton Park. Elinor is sad to leave their home at Norland because she has become closely attached to Edward Ferrars, the brother-in-law of her half-brother John. However, once at Barton Park, Elinor and Marianne discover many new acquaintances, including the retired officer and bachelor Colonel Brandon, and the gallant and impetuous John Willoughby, who rescues Marianne after she twists her ankle running down the hills of Barton in the rain. Willoughby openly and unabashedly courts Marianne, and together the two flaunt their attachment to one another, until Willoughby suddenly announces that he must depart for London on business, leaving Marianne lovesick and miserable. Meanwhile, Anne and Lucy Steele, two recently discovered relations of Lady Middleton's mother, Mrs. Jennings, arrive at Barton Park as guests of the Middletons. Lucy ingratiates herself to Elinor and informs her that she (Lucy) has been secretly engaged to Mr. Ferrars for a whole year. Elinor initially assumes that Lucy is referring to Edward's younger brother, Robert, but is shocked and pained to learn that Lucy is actually referring to her own beloved Edward.
In Volume II of the novel, Elinor and Marianne travel to London with Mrs. Jennings. Colonel Brandon informs Elinor that everyone in London is talking of an engagement between Willoughby and Marianne, though Marianne has not told her family of any such attachment. Marianne is anxious to be reunited with her beloved Willoughby, but when she sees him at a party in town, he cruelly rebuffs her and then sends her a letter denying that he ever had feelings for her. Colonel Brandon tells Elinor of Willoughby's history of callousness and debauchery, and Mrs. Jennings confirms that Willoughby, having squandered his fortune, has become engaged to the wealthy heiress Miss Grey.
In Volume III, Lucy's older sister inadvertently reveals the news of Lucy's secret engagement to Edward Ferrars. Edward's mother is outraged at the information and disinherits him, promising his fortune to Robert instead. Meanwhile, the Dashwood sisters visit family friends at Cleveland on their way home from London. At Cleveland, Marianne develops a severe cold while taking long walks in the rain, and she falls deathly ill. Upon hearing of her illness, Willoughby comes to visit, attempting to explain his misconduct and seek forgiveness. Elinor pities him and ultimately shares his story with Marianne, who finally realizes that she behaved imprudently with Willoughby and could never have been happy with him anyway. Mrs. Dashwood and Colonel Brandon arrive at Cleveland and are relieved to learn that Marianne has begun to recover.
When the Dashwoods return to Barton, they learn from their manservant that Lucy Steele and Mr. Ferrars are engaged. They assume that he means Edward Ferrars, and are thus unsurprised, but Edward himself soon arrives and corrects their misconception: it was Robert, not himself, whom the money-grubbing Lucy ultimately decided to marry. Thus,x Edward is finally free to propose to his beloved Elinor, and not long after, Marianne and Colonel Brandon become engaged as well. The couples live together at Delaford and remain in close touch with their mother and younger sister at Barton Cottage."
Ornament,"Janie Crawford, an attractive, confident, middle-aged Black woman, returns to Eatonville, Florida, after a long absence. The Black townspeople gossip about her and speculate about where she has been and what has happened to her young husband, Tea Cake. They take her confidence as aloofness, but Janie’s friend Pheoby Watson sticks up for her. Pheoby visits her to find out what has happened. Their conversation frames the story that Janie relates.
Janie explains that her grandmother raised her after her mother ran off. Nanny loves her granddaughter and is dedicated to her, but her life as a slave and experience with her own daughter, Janie’s mother, has warped her worldview. Her primary desire is to marry Janie as soon as possible to a husband who can provide security and social status for her. She finds a much older farmer named Logan Killicks and insists that Janie marry him.
After moving in with Logan, Janie is miserable. Logan is pragmatic and unromantic and, in general, treats her like a pack mule. One day, Joe Starks, a smooth-tongued and ambitious man, ambles down the road in front of the farm. He and Janie flirt in secret for a couple weeks before she runs off and marries him.
Janie and Jody, as she calls him, travel to all-Black Eatonville, where Jody hopes to have a “big voice.” A consummate politician, Jody soon succeeds in becoming the mayor, postmaster, storekeeper, and the biggest landlord in town. But Janie seeks something more than a man with a big voice. She soon becomes disenchanted with the monotonous, stifling life that she shares with Jody. She wishes that she could be a part of the rich social life in town, but Jody doesn’t allow her to interact with “common” people. Jody sees Janie as the fitting ornament to his wealth and power, and he tries to shape her into his vision of what a mayor’s wife should be. On the surface, Janie silently submits to Jody; inside, however, she remains passionate and full of dreams.
After almost two decades of marriage, Janie finally asserts herself. When Jody insults her appearance, Janie rips him to shreds in front of the townspeople, telling them all how ugly and impotent he is. In retaliation, he savagely beats her. Their marriage breaks down, and Jody becomes quite ill. After months without interacting, Janie visits him on his deathbed. Refusing to be silenced, she once again chastises him for the way that he treated her. As she berates him, he dies.
After Jody’s funeral, Janie feels free for the first time in years. She rebuffs various suitors who come to court her because she loves her newfound independence. But when Tea Cake, a man twelve years her junior, enters her life, Janie immediately senses a spark of mutual attraction. She begins dating Tea Cake despite critical gossip within the town. To everyone’s shock, Janie then marries Tea Cake nine months after Jody’s death, sells Jody’s store, and leaves town to go with Tea Cake to Jacksonville.
During the first week of their marriage, Tea Cake and Janie encounter difficulties. He steals her money and leaves her alone one night, making her think that he married her only for her money. But he returns, explaining that he never meant to leave her and that his theft occurred in a moment of weakness. Afterward, they promise to share all their experiences and opinions with each other. They move to the Everglades, where they work during the harvest season and socialize during the summer off-season. Tea Cake’s quick wit and friendliness make their shack the center of entertainment and social life.
A terrible hurricane bursts into the Everglades two years after Janie and Tea Cake’s marriage. As they desperately flee the rising waters, a rabid dog bites Tea Cake. At the time, Tea Cake doesn’t realize the dog’s condition; three weeks later, however, he falls ill. During a rabies--induced bout of madness, Tea Cake becomes convinced that Janie is cheating on him. He starts firing a pistol at her and Janie is forced to kill him to save her life. She is immediately put on trial for murder, but the all-white, all-male jury finds her not guilty. She returns to Eatonville where her former neighbors are ready to spin malicious gossip about her circumstances, assuming that Tea Cake has left her and taken her money. Janie wraps up her recounting to Pheoby, who is greatly impressed by Janie’s experiences. Back in her room that night, Janie feels at one with Tea Cake and at peace with herself."
Conducts,"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time takes place in the year 1998 in and around the town of Swindon, England. The fifteen-year-old narrator of the story, Christopher John Francis Boone, discovers the slain body of his neighbor’s poodle, Wellington, on the neighbor’s front lawn one evening and sets out to uncover the murderer. His investigation is at times aided, and at other times hampered, by the mild form of autism he lives with. After Christopher hits a policeman in a misunderstanding at the scene of the crime, the police take Christopher into custody. They release Christopher with only a stern warning, under the condition that he promises to them and to his father not to look into the murder any further.
Christopher chronicles his investigation in a book—the book we are reading—as part of a school assignment. Ignoring repeated warnings from his father, Christopher investigates the crime scene and conducts interviews with the residents of his block. He uncovers a more tangled plot than was first apparent when he discovers that his father and the owner of the slain dog, Mrs. Shears, had a romantic affair. He subsequently learns that their affair began in reaction to another relationship, one carried on between Mr. Shears and Christopher’s mother, before she disappeared from Christopher’s life.
At school, Christopher prepares for an A-level math exam that will enable him to attend a university, a feat no other child at his school has managed. He also continues to work on his book. Upon returning home one afternoon, Christopher accidentally leaves his book in plain view on the kitchen table. His father reads it, becomes angry, and confiscates it. Later, Christopher searches for the book and uncovers a series of letters, hidden in a shirt box in his father’s closet, addressed to him from his supposedly dead mother. The letters chronicle a life that his mother has continued to lead with Mr. Shears in London and contain repeated requests for Christopher to respond. In shock, Christopher passes out in his bedroom surrounded by the evidence of his father’s deception. When Father comes home and realizes what has happened, he breaks down in tears. He apologizes for his lies, explaining that he acted out of a desire to protect Christopher from the knowledge of his mother’s abandonment of the family. Christopher’s father also admits to killing Wellington after an argument with Mrs. Shears, his lover.
Christopher, now terrified of his father and feeling he can no longer trust him, sneaks out of the house and travels to London to live with his mother. During a harrowing journey, he copes with and overcomes the social fears and limitations of his condition, dodges police, and almost gets hit by a train. His arrival at his mother’s flat comes as a total surprise to her, as she had no idea that Christopher’s father had been withholding her letters. Christopher settles in for a time at his mother and Mr. Shears’s flat, but friction caused by his presence shortly results in his mother’s decision to leave Mr. Shears to return to Swindon. Christopher moves into a new apartment with his mother and begins to receive regular visits from his father. When Christopher’s pet rat Toby dies, Christopher’s father gives Christopher a puppy. At school, Christopher sits for his A-level math exam and receives an A grade, the best possible score. The novel ends with Christopher planning to take more A-level exams in physics and further math, and then attend a university in another town. He knows that he can do all of this because he solved the mystery of Wellington’s murder, was brave enough to find his mother, and wrote the book that we have read."
Boundaries,"Lawyer Bryan Stevenson gives a first-person account of his decades helping marginalized Americans who have been unfairly and harshly punished by the U.S. criminal justice system, which disproportionately targets people of color and poor people. At the heart of Just Mercy is the story of Walter McMillian, a Black man who was framed for the murder of a girl named Ronda Morrison, convicted, and sent to death row. 
Stevenson alternates chapters about Walter with his personal reflections on our country’s history with racial disparity and issues around incarceration. Stevenson highlights other groups of vulnerable people who have been victimized by the criminal justice system and shares the stories of the prisoners he has helped over the years. The book also follows the growth of Stevenson’s nonprofit law project, the Alabama-based Equal Justice Initiative (EJI), through its expansion from focusing on death row prisoners to helping people sentenced to life without parole. Stevenson chronicles how EJI becomes a significant force in criminal justice reform.
In 1983 as a law student, Stevenson discovers his life’s passion when he interns with the Georgia-based Southern Prisoners Defense Committee and meets his first death row prisoner. After graduation Stevenson accepts a job with the organization to represent poor prisoners, including those in Alabama who lack any public defender. He meets Walter McMillian on Alabama’s death row. Walter owns a successful business but also transgresses racial boundaries when he has an affair with a white woman. Soon after the affair becomes public, the woman’s friend, Ralph Myers, accuses Walter of committing the unsolved murder of Ronda Morrison, which has outraged the community. Law enforcement, including a racist sheriff and the district attorney, eagerly pounces on this accusation, overlooking Walter’s alibi and a lack of evidence. Instead, they actively force Ralph to stick with his story even when he tries to recant. They coerce other false witness testimonies, and—as revealed years later—actively suppress evidence.
After Stevenson and the team at EJI unsuccessfully appeal Walter’s conviction, they launch their own investigation of the crime and uncover new evidence. They find witnesses who can prove the witnesses against Walter lied as well as financial records that indicate that one of these witnesses was paid to give false testimony. Stevenson and his team also petition for and receive all records from Walter’s trial. However, their big break comes when they receive a phone call from Ralph, who now wants to make amends. Ralph admits to lying about Walter and says he was threatened by law enforcement. Stevenson wins a hearing for Walter where he can present his new evidence: Ralph’s testimony, which is confirmed by health care workers and other inmates, as well as recordings of the law enforcement team threatening Ralph if he doesn’t frame Walter. 
While the judge refuses to grant Walter relief, Stevenson continues the appeal process through the Alabama courts. The district attorney asks outside agents to investigate the murder for which Walter was convicted, and the investigators determine that Walter had nothing to do with the crime. Six weeks later, the court invalidates Walter’s conviction. Stevenson and the State file a joint motion to dismiss the charges, and Walter is set free.
Throughout the process, Stevenson and Walter become close friends, and Stevenson helps Walter upon his release, including filing a civil suit on his behalf and offering him a place to stay. Walter works with Stevenson to share his story, giving interviews and speaking at legal conferences, and Walter is even featured in a documentary. Unfortunately, Walter is diagnosed with advancing dementia and is forced to rely on family and eventually a nursing facility for his care. He dies in 2013. Stevenson gives a eulogy at his funeral and shares all he learned from Walter, particularly that we must extend mercy to everyone, even those who have not earned it.
Interspersed with chapters chronicling Walter’s narrative are stories of Stevenson’s other clients and work. His closeness with these prisoners and their horrifying circumstances makes Stevenson more determined to help and causes him to reflect on abstract issues that nevertheless imbue the criminal justice system, like humanity and mercy. Stevenson focuses on several categories of vulnerable people who become trapped in the system, including mentally ill prisoners, disabled prisoners, and poor women who give birth to stillborn babies. 
Stevenson and his team at EJI also become increasingly focused on juvenile offenders who are sometimes tried as adults despite their young age. These offenders may be given de facto death sentences by being sentenced to life without parole and face perilous circumstances when they are housed in adult prisons. Stevenson illustrates how these prisoners retain their own humanity while being forced to live under inhumane conditions. He also discusses some of the qualities common among these types of prisoners: They are generally poor and disproportionately people of color, and most of them lack adequate legal counsel. The juveniles have horrific backgrounds of abuse and neglect.
Stevenson and his team at EJI also work to change the legal system to offer more protection to marginalized people. Several of his cases end up before the U.S. Supreme Court, and he succeeds in winning rulings that ban as unconstitutional the conviction of children to life without parole and the execution of people deemed incompetent from dementia or neurological disease. EJI works to raise public awareness of issues surrounding unfair incarceration, produces groundbreaking reports on racial issues, and sets up programs to help formerly incarcerated people adjust to life on the outside.
Stevenson also reflects on the issues that surround the criminal justice system. His time spent with prisoners awaiting their execution makes him realize how inhumane it is to prepare another human to die. After decades of work, when Stevenson fails to prevent the execution of a man who suffers from an intellectual disability, he momentarily feels unable to continue his work. However, he realizes that he cannot help but be broken by his experiences and comes to understand that it is his own brokenness that allows him to more fully understand the need for mercy and to bring compassion to others. The book ends with Stevenson’s renewed commitment to helping others."
Operatives,"The four Garcia sisters, Carla, Sandra, Yolanda and Sofia, enjoyed a fairly sheltered and luxurious childhood in the Dominican Republic. They often received exciting presents from FAO Schwarz in the United States. Carla remembers an iron bank representing Mary ascending to heaven, which she gave to one of the family's maids, who was later dismissed for stealing the bank. Yolanda played with her boy cousin and showed him her genitals in exchange for a Human Body doll and modeling clay. She also stole a newborn kitten from its mother and put it inside a drum that she played until she grew bored and threw the kitten outside, where it sadly hobbled away. The mother cat appeared to her in nightmares and haunted her. Sandra wanted to be an artist but her irrepressible spirit got her in trouble and she was thrown out of art class. She later came upon a naked chained insane sculptor who scared her as she fell and broke her arm. She lost her artistic vision and settled for being the sculptor's muse when she realized he had used her face in a representation of the Virgin Mary.
When their father, Carlos, got in trouble with the secret police for agitating against the military dictatorship, the family enlisted the help of a CIA operative, Vic, to get them out of the country. They fled to New York City, where they had trouble adjusting culturally and materially to the new situation. Laura, the sisters' mother, came from a wealthy and influential family in the Dominican Republic and did not like having to become a middle class nobody in the United States. She found comfort through supporting her daughters' endeavors, such as Yolanda's poetry and Sofia's defiance of her father's overprotective nature.
Dr. Fanning helped Carlos get a medical fellowship, and offered to take the family out for a celebratory dinner once they had settled in the United States. Laura wanted to make a good impression and pressured the girls to behave themselves and not ask for any special treats. After Sandra saw Mrs. Fanning kiss her father in the restroom, she insisted that Dr. Fanning buy her a flamenco doll. Carla had trouble fitting in to American school settings, and was harassed by abusive and prejudiced schoolboys. She also was nearly molested by a perverted exhibitionist in a car. Yolanda began to write in English and found a way to express her own voice, though she started off by imitating Walt Whitman. Her father criticized her insubordination, which Yolanda perceived to be intellectual independence. Sofia was sent to the Dominican Republic as a punishment for using marijuana, though she ended up getting into more trouble by spending time without a chaperone with her illegitimate cousin, Manuel.
In college, Yolanda had trouble relating to men, since she was turned off by the vocabulary men use to describe sex. Though she was attracted to a boy, Rudy, she would not sleep with him and he accused her of being frigid. She was hurt by this but later realized that he was just a jerk. She later married a man she thought she loved, John, though at a certain point they had problems communicating. Like Rudy, he did not understand her Dominican cultural heritage, and could not appreciate the Spanish language. When Yolanda stopped trusting and loving John, she could not understand the words he used, and only heard ""babble, babble."" She had a mental breakdown at her parents' house, in which she could only quote and misquote bits of things she had read and heard throughout her life. She spent time in a mental hospital until she recovered. Her sister Sandra also had a mental breakdown, in which she thought she was regressing through evolution, and would eventually cease to be human.
After Sandra is released from the hospital, Sofia planned to reconcile with her father during a birthday party. She broke tradition, in that the daughters would usually come home for their father's birthday, but she hosts the party at her house to show off her German husband and two blond children. She and her father had fought when he accused her of sleeping around during a trip to Colombia, where she met her husband, Otto. She ran away from home to assert her independence, and later married Otto. Though the party was going well, Sofia was hurt that her father did not express more affection toward her. She humiliated him with a seductive kiss in the ear as part of a party game. Yolanda returned to the Dominican Republic, possibly for good, to embrace her extended family and cultural roots. Her family thought she was crazy for driving into the countryside by herself, but she ignored them. She got lost looking for fresh guavas, and then got a flat tire. When approached by two men, she panicked and pretended not to speak any Spanish. Yolanda felt more comfortable in her English speaking American identity than with the Dominican side of her personality."
Department,"Rashad and Quinn are both students at Springfield Central High School. They have some friends in common but have never interacted with each other. Rashad is Black, and his father has told him throughout his life about the importance of discipline for young Black men. Rashad’s father joined the army and then the police force before retiring and often tells Rashad that the army is the best opportunity for a Black man to succeed in the United States. Because of this, Rashad is part of the Reserve Officer Training Corps, or ROTC. However, Rashad would rather spend his time drawing and hanging out with his friends English, Shannon, and Carlos. 
Quinn is white, and his father died in Afghanistan. Quinn lives with his mother and his younger brother, Willy, and resents that people expect him to live up to the memory of his father. Quinn’s best friends are Dwyer and Guzzo, who lives across the street. Guzzo’s brother, Paul Galluzzo, is a police officer and has acted as a father figure to Quinn ever since Quinn’s father died. Quinn, Dwyer, and Guzzo are on the basketball team together, along with English.
One Friday, Rashad and Quinn are each planning on going to a party with their friends at Guzzo and Paul’s cousin Jill’s house. Quinn has a crush on Jill. On the way to the party, Rashad stops at Jerry’s Corner Mart to pick up some chips and gum. Jerry’s is always monitored by a police officer as a response to shoplifting incidents at the store. While Rashad is picking out chips, he goes to text his brother, Spoony. His phone is in his bag, so he puts it on the floor and kneels down to take the phone out. While he is kneeling, a woman who was standing behind him backs up and trips over him, causing them both to fall over and Rashad’s chips to slide up the aisle. 
The police officer on duty comes over and asks what happened but assumes Rashad was trying to steal before Rashad or the woman can explain. The police officer drags Rashad outside, handcuffs him, throws him to the ground, and begins beating him. Meanwhile, Quinn and his friends have been waiting in the alley next to Jerry’s to ask an adult to buy them beer that they can take to the party. When Quinn goes around to the front of Jerry’s, he sees what the police officer is doing to Rashad. He recognizes the police officer as Paul Galluzzo. He tells his friends to run and, when they are far enough away, explains what happened and tells Guzzo that he saw his brother. The three decide to go to the party and try to forget about it.
Over the weekend, Rashad wakes up in the hospital with a broken nose and ribs and is told he needs to stay there so the doctors can monitor his internal bleeding. Rashad’s father questions whether Rashad was presenting himself in a way that made him seem dangerous, while Spoony is outraged at the situation. The local news obtains footage of Paul beating Rashad and begins covering the story. The Galluzzo family decides to have a cookout on Sunday, which Quinn and Jill both find strange. Quinn and Jill talk at the cookout about what Paul did to Rashad, while Paul and Guzzo try to intimidate Quinn into not saying anything about what he saw.
At school that week, everyone is talking about what happened to Rashad. Quinn feels conflicted as he has only ever seen the good side of Paul and doesn’t know Rashad. On Tuesday, someone has painted graffiti on the sidewalk in front of the school that says, “Rashad is absent again today.” This message creates a division in the school between those who believe Rashad was innocent and those who believe Paul was just doing his job. When Rashad sees a picture of the graffiti, he knows it is Carlos’s work. 
Spoony and his girlfriend, Berry, plan a protest that coming Friday against the police department. Guzzo continues to question Quinn’s loyalty. At first, Quinn wants to believe that Paul was just trying to do his job, but he just can’t forget what he saw outside Jerry’s. On Thursday, Quinn wears a shirt to school that says, “I’m marching. Are you?” The coach of the basketball team tells the players not to go to the protest and tells Quinn he will call his mother to tell her about his shirt. Quinn’s mother confronts him about the protest, and Quinn says he is standing up for what he believes in, just as his father would have done.
The doctor releases Rashad from the hospital on Thursday, and Rashad plans on joining the protest the following day. On Friday morning, Rashad and Quinn both feel nervous about the protest. Quinn sees a tank-like police vehicle headed toward the school and worries about the protesters’ safety. However, after talking with Jill, he understands that Black people live in fear of police violence every day and that they should put themselves at risk for one day to speak out against this reality. Rashad and Quinn, along with an enormous crowd, march from Jerry’s Corner Mart to the police department, where they stage a die-in as Berry reads aloud the names of unarmed Black people killed by police officers. Rashad and Quinn notice each other during the die-in and feel a connection as they both think of the people on the list and how they will keep fighting for them."
Reflections,"In Common Sense, Thomas Paine argues for American independence. His argument begins with more general, theoretical reflections about government and religion, then progresses onto the specifics of the colonial situation.
Paine begins by distinguishing between government and society. Society, according to Paine, is everything constructive and good that people join together to accomplish. Government, on the other hand, is an institution whose sole purpose is to protect us from our own vices. Government has its origins in the evil of man and is therefore a necessary evil at best. Paine says that government's sole purpose is to protect life, liberty and property, and that a government should be judged solely on the basis of the extent to which it accomplishes this goal.
Paine then considers an imagined scenario in which a small group of people has been placed on an island, and cut off from the rest of society. In time, these people develop ties with one another, and lawmaking becomes inevitable. Paine says the people will be much happier if they are responsible for the creation of the laws that rule them. Paine is also implicitly arguing that such a system of representation is also better for the American colonists. Having expressed his disagreement with British reign in America, Paine proceeds to launch a general attack on the British system of government. Paine says the British system is too complex and rife with contradictions, and that the monarchy is granted far too much power. The British system pretends to offer a reasonable system of checks and balances, but in fact, it does not.
From here Paine moves on to discuss, in general, the notions of monarchy and hereditary succession. Man, Pain argues, was born into a state of equality, and the distinction that has arisen between king and subject is an unnatural one. At first, Paine says, the world was without kings, but the ancient Jews decided they wanted a king. This angered God, but he allowed them to have one. Paine presents pages of biblical evidence detailing God's wrath at the idea of the Jews having a king. The conclusion Paine reaches is that the practice of monarchy originates from sin, and is an institution that the Bible and God condemn. Paine calls hereditary succession an abominable practice. He says that even if people were to choose to have a king, that does not legitimize that King's child acting as a future ruler. Furthermore, hereditary succession has brought with it innumerable evils, such as incompetent kings, corruption, and civil war.
Having dispensed with the preliminary theoretical issues, Paine sets in to discuss the details of the American situation. In response to the argument that America has flourished under British rule, and therefore ought to stay under the king, Paine says that such an argument fails to realize that America has evolved and no longer needs Britain's help. Some say that Britain has protected America, and therefore deserves allegiance, but Paine responds that Britain has only watched over America in order to secure its own economic well-being. Paine adds that most recently, instead of watching over the colonies, the British have been attacking them, and are therefore undeserving of American loyalty.
Paine says that the colonies have little to gain from remaining attached to Britain. Commerce can be better conducted with the rest of Europe, but only after America becomes independent. Paine also asserts that if the colonies remain attached to Britain, the same problems that have arisen in the past will arise in the future. Paine argues that it is necessary to seek independence now, as to do otherwise would only briefly cover up problems that will surely reemerge.
Paine even proposes the form of government that the independent colonies should adopt. His recommendation is for a representative democracy that gives roughly equal weight to each of the colonies.
Paine explains why the current time is a good time to break free of Britain. Primarily, Paine focuses on the present size of the colonies, and on their current capabilities. He presents an inventory of the British Navy and gives calculations revealing how America could build a navy of comparable size. Paine recommends this as a way of ensuring America's security and prosperity in trade. Paine also argues that America is sufficiently small as to be united now. If time were to elapse, and the population of the colonies to grow, the same feeling of unity would not be present. Paine adds that if the Americans revolt now, they can use the vast expanses of uncharted land to the West in order to pay down some of the debt they will incur.
Paine says that as a colony of Britain, America lacks respectability on the international scene. They are seen simply as rebels, and cannot form substantial alliances with other nations. In order to prosper in the long term, the colonies need to be independent. Paine says that, by declaring independence, America will be able to ask for the help of other countries in its struggle for freedom. For all of these reasons, Paine says it is imperative and urgent that the colonies declare independence."
Shows,"Maus: A Survivor’s Tale is the illustrated true story of Vladek Spiegelman’s experiences during World War II, as told by his son, Artie. It consists of Book One: My Father Bleeds History, and Book Two: And Here My Troubles Began / From Mauschwitz to the Catskills and Beyond.
While the story is primarily focused on Vladek’s life, there is also a frame narrative (or, a story within the story) that shows Artie and his father interacting in the present, with Artie asking questions as Vladek relays his experiences. As Vladek describes the horrors that he faced as a Jewish person in World War II, there are interspersed scenes that reveal some of the challenges that Artie faces as the son of a concentration camp survivor. For example, Vladek is obsessive about money and constantly fusses over Artie’s clothes, decisions, and refusal to eat everything on his plate (even though Artie is an adult).
Except for a brief scene that depicts Artie as a human wearing a mouse mask, all of the people in the story appear as anthropomorphic animals. Jews are depicted as mice, Germans as cats, Poles as pigs, French as frogs, and Americans as dogs.
The story begins around 1978, with Artie visiting his father Vladek in New York City. Vladek looks frail and unhealthy; he’s had two heart attacks, and the suicide of his wife Anja (Artie’s mother) a decade earlier has taken a serious toll on him. Vladek is remarried to a woman named Mala with whom he constantly argues. Artie asks Vladek to tell him stories about life during World War II so that he can create a comic book based on Vladek’s experiences. 
Vladek starts his story in 1935, when he was living in Poland. After marrying Anja Zylberberg, Vladek moves to Sosnowiec, Poland, where her wealthy family helps them get established. Vladek and Anja have a son named Richieu, and Anja’s father, a millionaire, gives Vladek money to buy a factory in Bielsko. Vladek runs the factory during the week and returns home to Sosnowiec on the weekends to visit Anja and Richieu. Anja has a breakdown due to severe postpartum depression, and Vladek stays with her in a sanitarium in Czechoslovakia until she recovers. In 1939, Vladek is drafted into the Polish army and sent to the frontlines to fight the Nazis, where he is captured and becomes a prisoner of war. Vladek is eventually released back to Poland, and he returns to Anja and Richieu in Sosnoweic.
As the war continues, the Nazis begin rounding up Jewish people in Sosnowiec and sending them away on trains. Food and resources become scarce, and Vladek begins trading goods on the black market in order to provide for his family. Several of his friends are caught trading goods and executed. The Nazis later order that everyone report to the local stadium to have their papers verified; once there, many Jews are taken away for deportation. Luckily, Vladek’s cousin is working one of the tables at the stadium, and he is able to secure Vladek’s release, as well as Anja’s and her parents’. Vladek’s sister Fela, Fela’s four children, and Vladek’s father are not as fortunate—they are never seen again.
During one of Artie’s visits to help his father and record his stories about World War II, he finds out that his father read a comic he drew years before. The comic, Prisoner on the Hell Planet: A Case History, is included in Maus. It depicts Artie as a prisoner and shows the mental and emotional pain he endured because of his mother’s suicide in 1968.
Continuing on with his story, Vladek says that after leaving the stadium, he and his family were relocated to a ghetto in Srodula. In order to keep Richieu safe, Vladek and Anja send him to live with Anja’s sister Tosha in Zawiercie. They later find out that when Tosha discovered that she and the rest of the Jews in Zawiercie were going to be shipped to Auschwitz, she poisoned Richieu, herself, and her two children in order to spare them a worse fate at the camp.
When Vladek and Anja realize that the Germans are going to send everyone in the ghetto to concentration camps, they go into hiding to avoid capture. Once the ghetto is empty, Vladek and Anja begin to walk back to Sosnowiec. Along the way, they secure passage to Hungary with some smugglers, but the smugglers betray them and hand them over to the Germans. Vladek is sent to Auschwitz, and Anja is taken to Birkenau.
Vladek tells Artie that Anja kept diaries after the war, but Vladek destroyed them in a fit of grief. Artie becomes upset and yells at his father, saying that they would have had valuable information in them. At the beginning of Book Two, while Artie is staying with friends in Vermont, he receives a call from Vladek: Mala has left him and taken some of their shared valuables. Fearing that he will be responsible for taking care of his father, Artie goes to visit him in New York.
Vladek continues his story and describes the terrible conditions in Auschwitz. While working there, he uses his knowledge of trade skills to remain valuable and avoid execution. He learns that Anja is in the secondary camp, Auschwitz Birkenau, and arranges to do some repairs there so that he can see her. After hoarding the few resources available, Vladek bribes some of the Nazi guards to have Anja relocated to his camp to work in the munitions shop.
Vladek continues his story, describing the various ways that he used his skills and resourcefulness to help himself and Anja survive at Auschwitz. As the Russian army closes in on Auschwitz, Vladek is tasked with dismantling the gas chambers. All of the prisoners are eventually evacuated and relocated to Dachau, a camp in Germany. Vladek contracts typhus from the lice at Dachau and becomes very sick. He is sent toward Switzerland by train to be traded as a prisoner of war and is eventually rescued by American soldiers. After traveling back through Germany to Poland, he is reunited with Anja.
When Artie visits his father to hear the last of the story, Vladek is very sick. Mala has returned to help, but is still frustrated by Vladek. When Artie starts to leave, Vladek, confused and tired, calls him Richieu."
Sweeping,"Gregor Samsa, a traveling salesman, wakes up in his bed to find himself transformed into a large insect. He looks around his room, which appears normal, and decides to go back to sleep to forget about what has happened. He attempts to roll over, only to discover that he cannot due to his new body—he is stuck on his hard, convex back. He tries to scratch an itch on his stomach, but when he touches himself with one of his many new legs, he is disgusted. He reflects on how dreary life as a traveling salesman is and how he would quit if his parents and sister did not depend so much on his income. He turns to the clock and sees that he has overslept and missed his train to work.
Gregor’s mother knocks on the door, and when he answers her, Gregor finds that his voice has changed. His family suspects that he may be ill, so they ask him to open the door, which he keeps locked out of habit. He tries to get out of bed, but he cannot maneuver his transformed body. While struggling to move, he hears his office manager come into the family’s apartment to find out why Gregor has not shown up to work. He eventually rocks himself to the floor and calls out that he will open the door momentarily.
Through the door, the office manager warns Gregor of the consequences of missing work and hints that Gregor’s recent work has not been satisfactory. Gregor protests and tells the office manager that he will be there shortly. Neither his family nor the office manager can understand what Gregor says, and they suspect that something may be seriously wrong with him. Gregor manages to unlock and open the door with his mouth, since he has no hands. He begs the office manager’s forgiveness for his late start. Horrified by Gregor’s appearance, the office manager bolts from the apartment. Gregor tries to catch up with the fleeing office manager, but his father drives him back into the bedroom with a cane and a rolled newspaper. Gregor injures himself squeezing back through the doorway, and his father slams the door shut. Gregor, exhausted, falls asleep.
Gregor wakes and sees that someone has put milk and bread in his room. Initially excited, he quickly discovers that he has no taste for milk, once one of his favorite foods. He settles himself under a couch and listens to the quiet apartment. The next morning, his sister Grete comes in, sees that he has not touched the milk, and replaces it with rotting food scraps, which Gregor happily eats. This begins a routine in which his sister feeds him and cleans up while he hides under the couch, afraid that his appearance will frighten her. Gregor spends his time listening through the wall to his family members talking. They often discuss the difficult financial situation they find themselves in now that Gregor can’t provide for them. Gregor also learns that his mother wants to visit him, but his sister and father will not let her.
Gregor grows more comfortable with his changed body. He begins climbing the walls and ceiling for amusement. Discovering Gregor’s new pastime, Grete decides to remove some of the furniture to give Gregor more space. She and her mother begin taking furniture away, but Gregor finds their actions deeply distressing. He tries to save a picture on the wall of a woman wearing a fur hat, fur scarf, and a fur muff. Gregor’s mother sees him hanging on the wall and passes out. Grete calls out to Gregor—the first time anyone has spoken directly to him since his transformation. Gregor runs out of the room and into the kitchen. His father returns from his new job, and misunderstanding the situation, believes Gregor has tried to attack the mother. The father throws apples at Gregor, and one sinks into his back and remains lodged there. Gregor manages to get back into his bedroom but is severely injured.
Gregor’s family begins leaving the bedroom door open for a few hours each evening so he can watch them. He sees his family wearing down as a result of his transformation and their new poverty. Even Grete seems to resent Gregor now, feeding him and cleaning up with a minimum of effort. The family replaces their maid with a cheap cleaning lady who tolerates Gregor’s appearance and speaks to him occasionally. They also take on three boarders, requiring them to move excess furniture into Gregor’s room, which distresses Gregor. Gregor has also lost his taste for the food Grete brings and he almost entirely ceases eating.
One evening, the cleaning lady leaves Gregor’s door open while the boarders lounge about the living room. Grete has been asked to play the violin for them, and Gregor creeps out of his bedroom to listen. The boarders, who initially seemed interested in Grete, grow bored with her performance, but Gregor is transfixed by it. One of the boarders spots Gregor and they become alarmed. Gregor’s father tries to shove the boarders back into their rooms, but the three men protest and announce that they will move out immediately without paying rent because of the disgusting conditions in the apartment.
Grete tells her parents that they must get rid of Gregor or they will all be ruined. Her father agrees, wishing Gregor could understand them and would leave of his own accord. Gregor does in fact understand and slowly moves back to the bedroom. There, determined to rid his family of his presence, Gregor dies.
Upon discovering that Gregor is dead, the family feels a great sense of relief. The father kicks out the boarders and decides to fire the cleaning lady, who has disposed of Gregor’s body. The family takes a trolley ride out to the countryside, during which they consider their finances. Months of spare living as a result of Gregor’s condition have left them with substantial savings. They decide to move to a better apartment. Grete appears to have her strength and beauty back, which leads her parents to think about finding her a husband."
Pool,"Two migrant workers, George and Lennie, have been let off a bus miles away from the California farm where they are due to start work. George is a small, dark man with “sharp, strong features.” Lennie, his companion, is his opposite, a giant of a man with a “shapeless” face. Overcome with thirst, the two stop in a clearing by a pool and decide to camp for the night. As the two converse, it becomes clear that Lennie has an intellectual disability, and is deeply devoted to George and dependent upon him for protection and guidance. George finds that Lennie, who loves petting soft things but often accidentally kills them, has been carrying and stroking a dead mouse. George angrily throws it away, fearing that Lennie might catch a disease from the dead animal. George complains loudly that his life would be easier without having to care for Lennie, but the reader senses that their friendship and devotion is mutual. He and Lennie share a dream of buying their own piece of land, farming it, and, much to Lennie’s delight, keeping rabbits. George ends the night by treating Lennie to the story he often tells him about what life will be like in such an idyllic place.
The next day, the men report to the nearby ranch. George, fearing how the boss will react to Lennie, insists that he’ll do all the talking. He lies, explaining that they travel together because they are cousins and that a horse kicked Lennie in the head when he was a child. They are hired. They meet Candy, an old “swamper,” or handyman, with a missing hand and an ancient dog, and Curley, the boss’s mean-spirited son. Curley is newly married, possessive of his flirtatious wife, and full of jealous suspicion. Once George and Lennie are alone in the bunkhouse, Curley’s wife appears and flirts with them. Lennie thinks she is “purty,” but George, sensing the trouble that could come from tangling with this woman and her husband, warns Lennie to stay away from her. Soon, the ranch-hands return from the fields for lunch, and George and Lennie meet Slim, the skilled mule driver who wields great authority on the ranch. Slim comments on the rarity of friendship like that between George and Lennie. Carlson, another ranch-hand, suggests that since Slim’s dog has just given birth, they should offer a puppy to Candy and shoot Candy’s old, good-for-nothing dog.
The next day, George confides in Slim that he and Lennie are not cousins, but have been friends since childhood. He tells how Lennie has often gotten them into trouble. For instance, they were forced to flee their last job because Lennie tried to touch a woman’s dress and was accused of rape. Slim agrees to give Lennie one of his puppies, and Carlson continues to badger Candy to kill his old dog. When Slim agrees with Carlson, saying that death would be a welcome relief to the suffering animal, Candy gives in. Carlson, before leading the dog outside, promises to do the job painlessly.
Slim goes to the barn to do some work, and Curley, who is maniacally searching for his wife, heads to the barn to accost Slim. Candy overhears George and Lennie discussing their plans to buy land, and offers his life’s savings if they will let him live there too. The three make a pact to let no one else know of their plan. Slim returns to the bunkhouse, berating Curley for his suspicions. Curley, searching for an easy target for his anger, finds Lennie and picks a fight with him. Lennie crushes Curley’s hand in the altercation. Slim warns Curley that if he tries to get George and Lennie fired, he will be the laughingstock of the farm.
The next night, most of the men go to the local brothel. Lennie is left with Crooks, the lonely, Black stable-hand, and Candy. Curley’s wife flirts with them, refusing to leave until the other men come home. She notices the cuts on Lennie’s face and suspects that he, and not a piece of machinery as Curley claimed, is responsible for hurting her husband. This thought amuses her. The next day, Lennie accidentally kills his puppy in the barn. Curley’s wife enters and consoles him. She admits that life with Curley is a disappointment, and wishes that she had followed her dream of becoming a movie star. Lennie tells her that he loves petting soft things, and she offers to let him feel her hair. When he grabs too tightly, she cries out. In his attempt to silence her, he accidentally breaks her neck.
Lennie flees back to a pool of the Salinas River that George had designated as a meeting place should either of them get into trouble. As the men back at the ranch discover what has happened and gather together a lynch party, George joins Lennie. Much to Lennie’s surprise, George is not mad at him for doing “a bad thing.” George begins to tell Lennie the story of the farm they will have together. As he describes the rabbits that Lennie will tend, the sound of the approaching lynch party grows louder. George shoots his friend in the back of the head.
When the other men arrive, George lets them believe that Lennie had the gun, and George wrestled it away from him and shot him. Only Slim understands what has really happened, that George has killed his friend out of mercy. Slim consolingly leads him away, and the other men, completely puzzled, watch them leave."
Abdicated,"Genji is the son of the Emperor and Kiri-Tsubo, the Emperor's beloved mistress. Kiri-Tsubo lacks powerful connections and is often the subject of jealous attacks by others at court, some led by the another of the Emperor's mistresses, Lady Koki-den. Genji’s mother and grandmother die when he is a child and the bereft Emperor brings his son into the palace to oversee his education. His glittering future is foretold both by his personal gifts and by a Korean ambassador, who reads his future and promises that, as long as he does not seek political power, his life is likely to be one of distinction. When Genji reaches the age of maturity, his father associates his son with the clan of Gen and marries him to the Lady Aoi, a woman from a powerful family. The Emperor selects his and Lady Koki-den's first son as his Heir Apparent. 
Romantic adventure occupies much of Genji’s time as a young man, although he is also a gifted poet, dancer, musician, and painter. He establishes an ongoing relationship with the Lady of Rojukō. but neither this nor his marriage prevents him from pursuing other women who strike his fancy. The list of women he pursues is long—the Princess Wistaria, Cicada, Yūgao, Violet, Princess Hitachi, the older woman at court, Naishi-no-Kami, and the Lady of Akashi—and his success with them is varied. Cicada reluctantly rejects Genji and the older woman and Princess Hitachi prove not to his liking in the end. Throughout all of his adventures, however, his strongest attachments are to the two women who resemble his mother, Princess Wistaria and Violet. Both the Lady of Rojukō and Princess Wistaria eventually retreat from society and become nuns, in part to help them resist Genji. 
Genji’s life is not without its complications. Not only is Lady Koki-den jealous of Genji’s possible place in court, his wife, Lady Aoi, and his mistress, the Lady of Rojukō, are also unhappy about his intrigues. Rojukō is so upset that her spirit attacks Yūgao after she and Genji make love, leaving Yūgao dead. Rojukō’s spite even extends to Lady Aoi. After a disagreement over whose carriage should have priority, her spirit also attacks Genji’s wife. Aoi gives birth to a son but dies a few days later. Genji’s encounter with Naishi-no-Kami, one of Lady Koki-den’s sisters, intensifies her ire and she maneuvers to have Genji sent into exile. Because his father stepped down from the throne before he died, there is no real check on her power. So, although he is prominent, performing at festivals and popular with many at court, she prevails and he leaves for Suma and exile. 
Genji is miserable in exile, missing his friends and lovers. Violet and his friend Tō-no-Chūjō manage to write him, but most people obey the wishes of Lady Koki-den and the new Emperor. Genji fills his empty days with painting, thinking, and talking to fishermen. A dream of his father encourages him to brave the stormy seas. A relative of his mother’s, now a priest at Akashi, tries to persuade Genji to join with his daughter at their home. While there, Genji begins a relationship with the woman, who later gives birth to his daughter. Back at court, the Emperor has also had a dream of his father, who urges him to summon Genji back to the palace. He manages to evade his mother and sends the order. 
Genji’s return paves the way for the resolution of various plot lines. He meets many of the women he had previously seduced (or tried to seduce) and learns about the events that took place while he was away. Cicada’s husband has died, and she is on her way to become a nun. Princess Hitachi had not understood that Genji had lost interest in her and spent years waiting for his return. More mature after his trials, Genji decides to provide her with financial support. Violet is happy that he is home but expresses jealousy about his relationship with the Lady of Akashi, particularly the fact that the woman has given Genji an infant daughter. Finally, an ill Lady of Rojukū asks Genji to take charge of her beautiful daughter. Still attached to her, despite everything, Genji agrees. 
The abdication of Genji’s half-brother places his own (unacknowledged) son on the throne. Genji decides that the young Emperor should be married to the Lady of Rojukū’s daughter. But his friend, Tō-no-Chūjō, hopes to marry the new young Emperor to one of his own children. To decide the issue, there is a competition of paintings, some completed by members of court and others held in their collections. As usual, Genji wins the competition, securing an excellent marriage for his young ward, as he contemplates a possible retreat from the busy life at court. There are 37 more chapters in the full version of The Tale of Genji, but most abridged versions, including the Suematsu translation used here, end with the painting competition."
Statesmen,"The Common Man figures prominently both in the plot of the play and also as a narrator and commentator. Although treated in more detail in other sections, in the following plot summary, his presence is indicated only when he interacts directly with the other characters in the play.
Sir Thomas More, a scholar and statesman, objects to King Henry VIII’s plan to divorce and remarry in order to father a male heir. But More, ever the diplomat, keeps quiet about his feelings in the hopes that Henry will not bother him about the matter. At a meeting with Cardinal Wolsey, Lord Chancellor of England, More reviews the letter to Rome that requests the pope’s approval of Henry’s divorce. More points out that the pope provided a dispensation, or exemption, in order for Henry to get married in the first place, since Catherine, the woman Henry married, was the widow of Henry’s brother. More doubts that the pope will agree to overturn his first dispensation. Wolsey accuses More of being too moralistic and recommends that he be more practical.
 
After conversing with Wolsey, More runs into Thomas Cromwell, the king’s confidante. Cromwell, recently promoted to the position of cardinal’s secretary, insincerely tells More he is one of More’s greatest admirers. More also meets Signor Chapuys, the Spanish ambassador to England. Chapuys takes More’s noncommittal response to questions about his meeting with Wolsey to mean that More agrees that the divorce should not go through. Chapuys stresses Christian morals and Catholic dogma and seems most concerned that Henry does not insult Henry’s wife, Catherine, who is also the king of Spain’s aunt. Chapuys thinks he has found an ally in More.
 
Back at More’s home, More’s daughter, Margaret, has received a visit from Roper, her Lutheran boyfriend, despite the late hour. Roper asks More for Margaret’s hand, but More refuses to allow a Lutheran, in his eyes a heretic, into his family.
 
Meanwhile, Wolsey dies, leaving the position of Lord Chancellor vacant. The king was displeased with Wolsey’s failure to secure a papal dispensation to annul his marriage to Catherine, and Wolsey died in disgrace. More is appointed as Wolsey’s replacement.
 
Cromwell meets with Richard Rich, a low-level functionary whom More helped establish and to whom More gave a silver cup he was given as a bribe. (More did not realize that the cup was a bribe when he received it.) Cromwell tempts Rich with an opportunity for advancement, and the spineless Rich seems all too eager to accept the job in exchange for information he has about More. Rich and Chapuys, who has just entered, ask Cromwell what his current position is, and Cromwell announces simply that he does whatever the king wants done. He mentions that the king has planned a boat ride down the Thames to visit More. Meanwhile, More’s manservant, Matthew (played by the Common Man), has entered the room, and Cromwell, Rich, and Chapuys are eager to bribe him for information. Matthew tells them only the most well known facts about his master, but the trio pays him off anyway.
 
Back at More’s home in London’s Chelsea district, the king is set to arrive, but More is nowhere to be found. After fretting over his absence, the family eventually finds him busy at vespers (evening prayers). When the king arrives, all are on their best behavior, and More comes off as the most flattering of all. However, More does tell the king that More cannot agree to the divorce, reminding him that the king promised not to bother More about it. The king storms off, telling More he will leave him alone provided More does not speak out against the divorce. Alice, More’s wife, is angry at his behavior and thinks her husband should do as Henry wants. Rich arrives to tell More that Cromwell and Chapuys are collecting information about him. He asks for employment, but More turns him away.
 
At a local pub called the Loyal Subject, Cromwell meets Rich to conspire against More. Rich is reluctant and guilt-ridden, but he ultimately agrees to tell Cromwell about the bribe that More received and passed on to him. In exchange, Cromwell offers Rich a job.
 
Parliament passes the Act of Supremacy, which establishes the Church in England and appoints King Henry as its head. More decides that if the English bishops decide to go along with the act, he will resign as Lord Chancellor. Both Chapuys and Roper call it a remarkable “gesture,” but More, dead set against the act, thinks of it as a practical necessity. He refuses to explain himself to anyone but the king. Even his wife and daughter cannot know his reasons, because he does not want to put them in the position of having to testify against him later.
 
Cromwell meets with the Duke of Norfolk and tells him of his plan to bring More up on bribery charges. Norfolk proves that More gave the cup to Rich as soon as More realized it was a bribe, and Cromwell is forced to come up with some other way to entrap More. He tells Norfolk, however, that the king expects him to participate in the persecution of More.
 
A now impoverished More refuses to receive a letter of appreciation from the king of Spain, and he turns down the bishops’ sincere offer of charity. Cromwell calls More to his office and attempts to malign More by accusing him of sympathizing with the Holy Maid of Kent, who was executed for treason. Cromwell also accuses him of having written a book attributed to King Henry. More deconstructs both these charges, but when Cromwell reads a letter from King Henry calling More a villain, More is genuinely shaken. Meeting Norfolk outside, More insists that if he wishes to remain in the king’s favor, Norfolk should cease to be his friend, since by this point it is dangerous to know a man like More. Parliament passes another act, this time requiring subjects to swear an oath to King Henry’s supremacy in England over the Church and to the validity of his divorce and remarriage. The next time we see More, he is in jail for having refused to take the oath.
 
Cromwell, Norfolk, and the Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Cranmer, interrogate More in prison, but they cannot trick him into signing the oath or divulging his opinions on the king’s behavior. As long as More refuses to talk or sign the oath, Cromwell can keep him locked up but cannot have him executed. He removes More’s books but lets his family visit, hoping that they will be able to reason with him. Though More’s daughter, Margaret, tries to convince her father he has done all he can, More refuses to relent. Alice finally sympathizes fully with More’s predicament, and, displaying their full love toward each other, they reconcile just before the jailer (the Common Man) insists that the visit is over.
 
Cromwell gives Rich the office of attorney general for Wales in exchange for Rich’s false testimony at More’s trial. Though More never opened his mouth, Rich claims he heard More deny the king’s authority over the Church. More is sentenced to death but not before he can express his disapproval of the Supremacy Act and his disappointment with a government that would kill a man for keeping quiet. More goes to his death with dignity and composure, and the play ends with his beheading."
Bays,"A wake-up call sounds in a Stalinist labor camp in 1951, on a bitterly cold winter morning. Ivan Denisovich Shukhov, a prisoner in Camp HQ, is usually up on time, but this morning he suffers a fever and aches, and yearns for a little more time in bed. Thinking that a kindly guard is on duty, he rests past the wake-up call a while. Unfortunately, a different guard is making the rounds, and he punishes Shukhov for oversleeping with three days in the solitary confinement cell, which the characters call “the hole.” Led off, Shukhov soon realizes that the sentence is just a threat, and that he will only have to wash the floors of the officers’ headquarters. Shukhov removes his shoes and efficiently completes the job, proceeding quickly to the mess hall, where he worries he has missed breakfast. He meets the sniveling Fetyukov, a colleague who has saved Shukhov’s gruel for him. After breakfast, Shukhov heads to sick bay to get his fever and aches examined. The medical orderly, Kolya, tells him he should have been ill the previous night, since the clinic is closed in the morning. Shukhov’s fever is not high enough to get him off work.
Shukhov returns to the hut in time for the body search and body count, in which the prisoners are searched for forbidden articles and counted to make sure none have escaped. He carefully hides the bread he has taken at breakfast, sewing it into his mattress. The men undress in the freezing cold for the search. One inmate, Buynovsky, is wearing a flannel vest. He is sentenced to ten days in the hole for this infraction. Shukhov is happy not to have any forbidden things on him. He has neither food nor letters to his family, which he does not write anymore. He reflects on his wife’s recent letter urging him to take up carpet-dyeing when he gets out of prison. But Shukhov is not interested in this opportunity, despite the easy money.
After the search, Shukhov’s group, Gang 104, is marched off for work at the Power Station, a building site in the open fields. At the site, Shukhov looks at his colleague Alyoshka, a devout Baptist who seems happy to slave away. Shukhov is filled with respect for his foreman, Tyurin, a big tough man with a decent soul. Though they are forbidden to do so, the men try to keep the wind out of the windows by covering them with tar paper. The teenage prisoner Gopchik fetches wire for piping, and asks Shukhov to show him how to make a spoon. They all rest a while. It is too soon before the noon meal to start laying bricks, as the mortar would only dry in the trough while they ate.
At the noon meal, Shukhov sneaks a second helping of food. He is full after eating two bowls of gruel. The gang returns to the work site. On the way, Shukhov spots a bit of scrap metal in the snow, which he takes and hides in the hopes of making a knife out of it later. The prisoners stoke the stove. While preparing to work again, the gang hears Tyurin’s tale of being imprisoned for having a rich peasant father. The men begin to mortar the wall. One of the deputy foremen, Pavlo, agrees to be on the mortar team, though, as an officer, he is not required to mortar. Pavlo’s friendliness earns him the men’s respect. The bricklaying begins. Shukhov works feverishly and makes no errors. A camp manager stops by to chide Tyurin for the tar paper illegally hung in the work site windows. He threatens to punish Tyurin, but Tyurin waves him off. Alyoshka works selflessly. Time passes quickly, and the men hear the meal signal. Shukhov continues working, even after his colleague Kildigs has stopped. He is late to lunch now, but he wants to hide his precious trowel, a tool that is hard to get, so that another man will not take it. He is nearly unable to join his gang, but catches up when the gang is delayed by preparations for another body count. The men discover that a man from Moldavia is missing from another gang. The man, who has fallen asleep at the site, is finally found. The other men are furious at him for delaying their meal.
Shukhov remembers his earlier intention to go to sick bay but reflects that he would rather have supper. At the body search, Shukhov suddenly panics, remembering the bit of steel he has hidden in his mitten. He prays to God to be kept out of the hole. By a stroke of good luck, the guard does not discover the bit of steel. Shukhov returns to the camp. On the suspicion that a fellow inmate, Tsezar, has received a rich parcel of food, he offers to wait in line in the parcel room for Tsezar. Shukhov waits until Tsezar comes. There is indeed a package. Shukhov makes his way to the mess hall for supper, where the gangs are being admitted by twos instead of singly, creating a chaos inside. He manages to find his comrades, grab an empty tray, and bring their rations to the table. For his outstanding labor at the Power Station, Shukhov has been awarded 400 grams of bread. He eats in bliss, eyeing his extra rations to make sure no one grabs them. He takes Tsezar’s ration to the hut, where Tsezar, in exception to the camp rules, is allowed to eat. Tsezar has displayed the contents of his parcel to everyone, and he allows Shukhov to keep Tsezar’s supper ration.
After the body count, Shukhov prepares to sleep, though the second count has not yet been completed. He revels in his abundance of bread. At the second roll call, Tsezar panics, unsure what to do with his parcel. Shukhov helps him guard it from the other prisoners. Tsezar rewards Shukhov with a couple of biscuits and a bit of sausage. Before sleeping, Shukhov thanks God for getting him through another day. Alyoshka hears Shukhov’s prayer, and urges Shukhov to pray properly. He also encourages Shukhov to pursue the goods of the spirit and not, as Tsezar does, those of the flesh. Shukhov reflects on Alyoshka’s sentiment. Suddenly, for no reason, he hands Alyoshka one of his biscuits. Shukhov meditates that his day has been almost happy. The narrator adds that this day has been just one of the 3,653 days of Shukhov’s sentence."
Unconstitutional,"Lawyer Bryan Stevenson gives a first-person account of his decades helping marginalized Americans who have been unfairly and harshly punished by the U.S. criminal justice system, which disproportionately targets people of color and poor people. At the heart of Just Mercy is the story of Walter McMillian, a Black man who was framed for the murder of a girl named Ronda Morrison, convicted, and sent to death row. 
Stevenson alternates chapters about Walter with his personal reflections on our country’s history with racial disparity and issues around incarceration. Stevenson highlights other groups of vulnerable people who have been victimized by the criminal justice system and shares the stories of the prisoners he has helped over the years. The book also follows the growth of Stevenson’s nonprofit law project, the Alabama-based Equal Justice Initiative (EJI), through its expansion from focusing on death row prisoners to helping people sentenced to life without parole. Stevenson chronicles how EJI becomes a significant force in criminal justice reform.
In 1983 as a law student, Stevenson discovers his life’s passion when he interns with the Georgia-based Southern Prisoners Defense Committee and meets his first death row prisoner. After graduation Stevenson accepts a job with the organization to represent poor prisoners, including those in Alabama who lack any public defender. He meets Walter McMillian on Alabama’s death row. Walter owns a successful business but also transgresses racial boundaries when he has an affair with a white woman. Soon after the affair becomes public, the woman’s friend, Ralph Myers, accuses Walter of committing the unsolved murder of Ronda Morrison, which has outraged the community. Law enforcement, including a racist sheriff and the district attorney, eagerly pounces on this accusation, overlooking Walter’s alibi and a lack of evidence. Instead, they actively force Ralph to stick with his story even when he tries to recant. They coerce other false witness testimonies, and—as revealed years later—actively suppress evidence.
After Stevenson and the team at EJI unsuccessfully appeal Walter’s conviction, they launch their own investigation of the crime and uncover new evidence. They find witnesses who can prove the witnesses against Walter lied as well as financial records that indicate that one of these witnesses was paid to give false testimony. Stevenson and his team also petition for and receive all records from Walter’s trial. However, their big break comes when they receive a phone call from Ralph, who now wants to make amends. Ralph admits to lying about Walter and says he was threatened by law enforcement. Stevenson wins a hearing for Walter where he can present his new evidence: Ralph’s testimony, which is confirmed by health care workers and other inmates, as well as recordings of the law enforcement team threatening Ralph if he doesn’t frame Walter. 
While the judge refuses to grant Walter relief, Stevenson continues the appeal process through the Alabama courts. The district attorney asks outside agents to investigate the murder for which Walter was convicted, and the investigators determine that Walter had nothing to do with the crime. Six weeks later, the court invalidates Walter’s conviction. Stevenson and the State file a joint motion to dismiss the charges, and Walter is set free.
Throughout the process, Stevenson and Walter become close friends, and Stevenson helps Walter upon his release, including filing a civil suit on his behalf and offering him a place to stay. Walter works with Stevenson to share his story, giving interviews and speaking at legal conferences, and Walter is even featured in a documentary. Unfortunately, Walter is diagnosed with advancing dementia and is forced to rely on family and eventually a nursing facility for his care. He dies in 2013. Stevenson gives a eulogy at his funeral and shares all he learned from Walter, particularly that we must extend mercy to everyone, even those who have not earned it.
Interspersed with chapters chronicling Walter’s narrative are stories of Stevenson’s other clients and work. His closeness with these prisoners and their horrifying circumstances makes Stevenson more determined to help and causes him to reflect on abstract issues that nevertheless imbue the criminal justice system, like humanity and mercy. Stevenson focuses on several categories of vulnerable people who become trapped in the system, including mentally ill prisoners, disabled prisoners, and poor women who give birth to stillborn babies. 
Stevenson and his team at EJI also become increasingly focused on juvenile offenders who are sometimes tried as adults despite their young age. These offenders may be given de facto death sentences by being sentenced to life without parole and face perilous circumstances when they are housed in adult prisons. Stevenson illustrates how these prisoners retain their own humanity while being forced to live under inhumane conditions. He also discusses some of the qualities common among these types of prisoners: They are generally poor and disproportionately people of color, and most of them lack adequate legal counsel. The juveniles have horrific backgrounds of abuse and neglect.
Stevenson and his team at EJI also work to change the legal system to offer more protection to marginalized people. Several of his cases end up before the U.S. Supreme Court, and he succeeds in winning rulings that ban as unconstitutional the conviction of children to life without parole and the execution of people deemed incompetent from dementia or neurological disease. EJI works to raise public awareness of issues surrounding unfair incarceration, produces groundbreaking reports on racial issues, and sets up programs to help formerly incarcerated people adjust to life on the outside.
Stevenson also reflects on the issues that surround the criminal justice system. His time spent with prisoners awaiting their execution makes him realize how inhumane it is to prepare another human to die. After decades of work, when Stevenson fails to prevent the execution of a man who suffers from an intellectual disability, he momentarily feels unable to continue his work. However, he realizes that he cannot help but be broken by his experiences and comes to understand that it is his own brokenness that allows him to more fully understand the need for mercy and to bring compassion to others. The book ends with Stevenson’s renewed commitment to helping others."
Years,"Solomon Northup is a thirty-three-year-old Black man living in Saratoga, New York, in 1841. He is happily married and has three children who he adores. He works as a carpenter and is also a skilled violinist who often plays for his friends. Solomon’s father was born into slavery but was freed by the lawyer Henry Northup, who remains a close friend of Solomon’s family. One day, two white men invite Solomon to temporarily perform as a violinist in their traveling circus, and Solomon enthusiastically agrees. Believing that he will only be gone for a few days, Solomon doesn’t tell his wife that he’s leaving. One night while in Washington, D.C., Solomon becomes sick and loses consciousness. When Solomon wakes up, he finds himself shackled in a dark cell.
Solomon discovers that he has been kidnapped by a slave trader named James Burch, who beats Solomon every time he insists that he’s a free man. The slave dealer sends Solomon and other kidnapped men, women, and children to New Orleans by ship. Once there, Solomon is told that his name is now “Platt.” A plantation owner named William Ford soon buys Solomon. Solomon describes Ford as a kind-hearted man who only condones slavery because he was raised with the belief that it is not immoral. Unfortunately, Ford runs into financial trouble and is forced to sell Solomon to a cruel carpenter named Tibeats. Tibeats has a short temper and tries to kill Solomon several times, but his efforts are thwarted by Ford and by Solomon himself.
Tibeats eventually sells Solomon to the brutal Edward Epps. Often drunk, Epps alternates between whipping his slaves and using them for entertainment. Epps regularly rapes a spirited, beautiful slave named Patsey, and as a result, Mrs. Epps despises her and takes pleasure in seeing her suffer. Both Epps and his wife treat Patsey with horrific brutality. Solomon constantly thinks about how to regain his freedom. He knows that he will be killed or captured if he tries to escape, so he feels that his best option would be to send a letter to his friends in Saratoga to obtain proof that he is a free man. However, all of his attempts to send a letter fail, and he often feels hopeless. His only solace is playing his violin, which allows him to earn money and enables him to occasionally leave the plantation to play at nearby houses. 
After toiling and enduring terrible abuse on Epps’s plantation for ten years, Solomon meets Bass, a white carpenter working on Epps’s property. Bass is an abolitionist known for his unconventional opinions, and he and Solomon become friendly. One day, Solomon hears Bass arguing with Epps about slavery. Bass claims that slavery is morally wrong and says that there is no inherent difference between Black and white people. Epps thinks this is ridiculous, but Solomon feels hopeful that Bass can help him. Solomon explains his history to Bass and asks for Bass’ help in mailing a letter to Saratoga. Bass agrees but warns that after twelve years, everyone Solomon knows there might be dead. Bass mails the letter in August, but by Christmas there is still no response. Bass tells Solomon he plans to travel to Saratoga in the spring and will try to get in touch with Solomon’s acquaintances.
Meanwhile, the letter has been received in Saratoga and makes its way to Solomon’s wife. She contacts Henry Northup, who agrees to help restore Solomon’s freedom. Northup gets permission from the governor and travels to New Orleans. However, because everyone there knows Solomon as Platt, no one can help Henry Northup find Solomon. After some searching, Northup understands that Bass sent the letter and contacts him to learn of Solomon’s location.
On January 3, Solomon and the other slaves are working in the field when they see two men coming down from a carriage. Solomon is elated when he recognizes Northup. Northup tells Epps that Solomon is a free man, and Northup and Solomon leave the plantation. Solomon returns home to Saratoga, where he joyfully reunites with his wife and children."
Courts,"As a huntress and her family’s primary source of survival, nineteen-year-old Feyre stalks the bleak woods, a little farther from home than usual. Her family was once very wealthy, but they now live in poverty. Feyre’s luck turns when she spots a deer. At the same time, an enormous wolf appears out of nowhere. Feyre wonders if the wolf is a faerie in disguise. She hates faeries for all the harm they have done to humans. Feyre decides to use a precious ash arrow, a surefire method to kill a faerie, just in case. She fires the arrow as the wolf attacks the deer, killing the beast. The next evening, a golden beast bursts through the door of her family’s rundown cottage. The beast reveals that the wolf was indeed a faerie named Andras. The beast demands payment for his death under the terms of the Treaty between the human and faerie realms. The beast gives Feyre a choice: he can kill her now, or she can follow him to the faerie realm of Prythian to live out the rest of her days. Feyre chooses to live. 
In Prythian, Feyre learns the golden beast is a High Fae called Tamlin. He is the High Lord of the Spring Court. Tamlin and all the faeries in his court wear permanent masks on their faces due to an affliction called the blight. At first, Feyre is determined to escape Prythian, but she soon becomes accustomed to her new home. She learns about its history and magic and that much of what she was raised to believe about faeries, including their inability to lie and their aversion to iron, are myths. Feyre develops an affection for Alis, her lady-in-waiting, and Lucien, Tamlin’s best friend. Tamlin encourages her to explore her love for painting and to improve her reading skills. He reveals that he has ensured her family is well cared for in the human realm. Romantic and sexual tension grows between them. Although Feyre finds Prythian beautiful, it is full of dangerous creatures and intrigue. The blight makes life in Prythian increasingly perilous. After a threatening visit from a High Fae named Rhysand, Tamlin believes Feyre is no longer safe in Prythian and decides to send her back to the human realm. The night before she leaves, they make love. Tamlin tells Feyre that he loves her. Though she loves him too, she cannot bring herself to speak the words aloud.  
Feyre returns to the human realm to find that Tamlin was true to his word. Her family is extremely wealthy and well cared for. Her father and sisters have been glamoured, or tricked with faerie magic, and know nothing about faeries or how their wealth was restored. They believe Feyre has been away caring for a sick aunt. Soon, her sister Nesta reveals the glamour did not work on her. After Feyre was taken to Prythian, Nesta searched for her but was unable to cross the wall between the human and faerie realms. Nesta also reveals she is still angry at their father for not trying harder to save their mother’s life. Nesta’s words inspire Feyre to fight harder for Tamlin and she sets off for Prythian to fight the blight alongside him.  
When Feyre arrives at the Spring Court, Tamlin’s manor house is in shambles. Alis is the only one left. Alis reveals that the blight is a euphemism that refers to Amarantha, the High Queen of Prythian. Amarantha is an interloper who took Prythian over by force. She stole the powers of the High Fae and placed a curse on Tamlin that could only be broken by a woman who hated the fae declaring her love for him. Since Feyre never told Tamlin she loved him, the curse remained. The curse prevented the faeries from telling Feyre the truth, so they used the blight to explain their masks and other conflicts. Alis can tell Feyre this because Amarantha has relaxed part of the curse, believing she’s already won, but there is still one aspect of the curse Alis cannot reveal. When Alis explains that Tamlin and Lucien are Amarantha’s captives, Feyre decides to go after them. 
Feyre journeys to Amarantha’s faerie court Under the Mountain, where she becomes a captive as well. Amarantha gives her the chance to save Tamlin by completing three tasks or by solving a riddle. For the first task, Feyre uses her hunting skills to escape a giant worm in a labyrinth. As the faeries place bets and watch in amusement, the only one to bet on Feyre is Rhysand. After, he heals her broken arm. In exchange, Feyre agrees to spend a week every month with him in the Night Court. For the second task, Feyre must successfully solve a puzzle and choose the right lever or she and Lucien will be impaled and crushed. She makes the correct choice with the aid of Rhysand’s voice in her head. In the meantime, Rhysand parades Feyre around as his escort at parties. 
For the third task, Feyre must stab three faeries in the heart with ash wood daggers. Despite her guilt, she knows it’s the only way to break the curse. She stabs the first two faeries, but when the hood is removed from the third one, it is Tamlin. At first, Feyre believes she must kill the man she loves until she remembers two conversations about Tamlin’s heart of stone. She believes this means Tamlin’s heart is literally made of stone so he cannot be harmed by the dagger. Knowing Amarantha wants Tamlin for herself and doesn’t want to see him killed, Feyre plunges the dagger into Tamlin’s chest. She is correct, but Amarantha refuses to break the curse based on a technicality. In a rage, Amarantha beats Feyre almost to death. Feyre finally realizes the answer to Amarantha’s riddle is the word love. She speaks the solution aloud and the curse breaks just as Feyre dies. With the curse broken, Tamlin and Rhysand join forces to destroy Amarantha. One by one, the six High Lords gift Feyre with healing light and immortality. Tamlin sets a bit of this golden light on her heart, resurrecting Feyre and transforming her into one of the High Fae. Feyre and Tamlin are finally free, but Feyre must reckon with her new life and the lives she took to bring them to this point."
Specialized,"In Outliers: The Story of Success, Malcolm Gladwell considers the circumstances that lead to success. The first half of the book looks closely at how opportunities matter more in the lives of successful people than hard work or raw talent. The second half of the book focuses on cultural legacies: behavioral tendencies rooted in their ancestral past.
Part One examines the role of opportunity in the lives of extremely successful people. Gladwell’s first example is the Canadian Hockey League, the world’s most competitive youth hockey league. Since the cutoff date for the Canadian leagues that serve the youngest players is January 1, those born in the first part of the calendar year are much larger and more coordinated than their peers. The larger and more coordinated kids are given more playing time and better coaching, and thus become better players by the time they reach the top league. An overwhelming majority of Canadian professional hockey players have birthdays in January, February or March.
Gladwell proposes that 10,000 hours of practice is needed to master a skill, even for prodigies like Mozart. Bill Joy, Bill Gates, and the Beatles all worked hard to achieve success but benefited from opportunities they did not create. Joy, one of the founders of Sun Microsystems, happened to attend one of the first colleges in the world with a time-sharing terminal. In graduate school, he had a terminal in his room, where he spent all of his free time programming. Gates happened to attend a private high school with a time-sharing terminal connected to a mainframe in Seattle. He also was able to spend all of his free time programming. Early on, the Beatles were hired to play long shows day after day in Hamburg, Germany. 
Birth year or era is another form of opportunity. Gates and Joy (as well as other early programmers) all reached the end of their teen years just as personal computers became available to the public. In another example, fourteen of the top seventy-five richest people in the history of the world happened to be alive at the same time, in the same country: the United States in the mid-1800s.
Opportunity matters more than an individual’s IQ. Using a study conducted by Lewis Terman, the creator of the Stanford-Binet IQ test, Gladwell shows that “practical intelligence” is as important as “analytical intelligence.” He also contrasts Chris Langan, one of the world’s smartest living people, with Robert Oppenheimer. While both had difficulties in college, only Oppenheimer had a successful life, due to his practical intelligence.
The last portion of Part One looks at Joe Flom, a successful lawyer from New York City. While he was born into a poor family to Jewish immigrants (in a time when Jewish immigrants were not treated well), many of the disadvantages in his life were actually benefits and directly contributed to his success.
Part Two investigates cultural legacies. Using flight recorder transcripts from several plane crashes from the last few decades, Gladwell shows that cultural expectations and habits can be a severe hindrance to pilots. Copilots from countries that have a high “Power Distance Index” (those that show the most deference to authority) will often avoid telling pilots that they are making mistakes, even when the mistakes are potentially fatal. After recognizing the dangers of such cultural expectations, commercial aviation has instituted programs to change the way flight crews talk with one another. 
Gladwell next analyzes the disparity in public school math test scores between Eastern and Western countries. He suggests that the cultures in which rice paddy farming is historically important have a stronger work ethic. Using various examples, Gladwell shows that hard work has a greater impact on success in learning mathematics than intelligence. 
The final example is an examination of the KIPP school in the South Bronx and the “achievement gap” between socioeconomic groups. American students from middle-class and affluent households retain more information over summer vacation and are more likely to make additional gains than students from low-income households. The KIPP school uses longer school days and summer programming to eliminate the achievement gap for low-income children. While the work schedule is very rigorous, the school’s students go on to great academic success.
Gladwell demonstrates that if more opportunities were available, there would be far more successful people and the world would be richer for it."
Call,"Buck, a powerful dog, half St. Bernard and half sheepdog, lives on Judge Miller’s estate in California’s Santa Clara Valley. He leads a comfortable life there, but it comes to an end when men discover gold in the Klondike region of Canada and a great demand arises for strong dogs to pull sleds. Buck is kidnapped by a gardener on the Miller estate and sold to dog traders, who teach Buck to obey by beating him with a club and, subsequently, ship him north to the Klondike.
Arriving in the chilly North, Buck is amazed by the cruelty he sees around him. As soon as another dog from his ship, Curly, gets off the boat, a pack of huskies violently attacks and kills her. Watching her death, Buck vows never to let the same fate befall him. Buck becomes the property of Francois and Perrault, two mail carriers working for the Canadian government, and begins to adjust to life as a sled dog. He recovers the instincts of his wild ancestors: he learns to fight, scavenge for food, and sleep beneath the snow on winter nights. At the same time, he develops a fierce rivalry with Spitz, the lead dog in the team. One of their fights is broken up when a pack of wild dogs invades the camp, but Buck begins to undercut Spitz’s authority, and eventually the two dogs become involved in a major fight. Buck kills Spitz and takes his place as the lead dog.
With Buck at the head of the team, Francois and Perrault’s sled makes record time. However, the men soon turn the team over to a mail carrier who forces the dogs to carry much heavier loads. In the midst of a particularly arduous trip, one of the dogs becomes ill, and eventually the driver has to shoot him. At the end of this journey, the dogs are exhausted, and the mail carrier sells them to a group of American gold hunters—Hal, Charles, and Mercedes.
Buck’s new masters are inexperienced and out of place in the wilderness. They overload the sled, beat the dogs, and plan poorly. Halfway through their journey, they begin to run out of food. While the humans bicker, the dogs begin to starve, and the weaker animals soon die. Of an original team of fourteen, only five are still alive when they limp into John Thornton’s camp, still some distance from their destination. Thornton warns them that the ice over which they are traveling is melting and that they may fall through it. Hal dismisses these warnings and tries to get going immediately. The other dogs begin to move, but Buck refuses. When Hal begins to beat him, Thornton intervenes, knocking a knife from Hal’s hand and cutting Buck loose. Hal curses Thornton and starts the sled again, but before they have gone a quarter of a mile, the ice breaks open, swallowing both the humans and the dogs.
Thornton becomes Buck’s master, and Buck’s devotion to him is total. He saves Thornton from drowning in a river, attacks a man who tries to start a fight with Thornton in a bar, and, most remarkably, wins a $1,600 wager for his new master by pulling a sled carrying a thousand-pound load. But Buck’s love for Thornton is mixed with a growing attraction to the wild, and he feels as if he is being called away from civilization and into the wilderness. This feeling grows stronger when he accompanies Thornton and his friends in search of a lost mine hidden deep in the Canadian forest.
While the men search for gold, Buck ranges far afield, befriending wolves and hunting bears and moose. He always returns to Thornton in the end, until, one day, he comes back to camp to find that Yeehat Indians have attacked and killed his master. Buck attacks the Indians, killing several and scattering the rest, and then heads off into the wild, where he becomes the leader of a pack of wolves. He becomes a legendary figure, a Ghost Dog, fathering countless cubs and inspiring fear in the Yeehats—but every year he returns to the place where Thornton died, to mourn his master before returning to his life in the wild."
Angel,"Uncertain of his future goals, seventeen-year-old Richie Perry, a Black high school graduate from Harlem, travels to Vietnam to fight in the United States Army. When Richie leaves basic training for Vietnam, he harbors a host of illusions about the war and the army. He confidently believes that the medical profile he has received for a knee injury will be properly processed and prevent him from engaging in combat. He also believes in the flurry of rumors about imminent peace and in the prevalent romantic myths about warfare.
When Richie first arrives in Vietnam, he befriends Harold “Peewee” Gates and Jenkins, two new recruits assigned to the same squad. A sergeant assures them that they should encounter only easy, light work, as there is not much fighting near Chu Lai, where their company is stationed. These rumors prove to be wishful thinking, however, when the three new soldiers arrive at their camp; Jenkins is killed by a land mine during the squad’s first patrol. Richie is deeply shaken and longs to communicate his terror and horror to his family, but he finds himself unable to write the truth to his mother and his brother, Kenny.
As Richie witnesses ever-increasing levels of destruction and brutality, he begins to doubt whether there is any straightforward morality in war. He sees that the line between good and bad is often ambiguous. He also becomes disillusioned with the selfishness of his commanding officers, particularly the company commander, Captain Stewart, who is more concerned with earning a promotion than he is with the safety of the soldiers under his command. When Richie’s platoon leader, Lieutenant Carroll, is killed during a combat mission, Richie begins a serious search for answers to why he and his fellow soldiers are even fighting in Vietnam in the first place. Though his friends insist that such thoughts are futile and dangerous, Richie feels compelled to find meaning within the chaos. He also longs for some way to communicate his confused thoughts and emotions to his family, but he remains unable to do so. Richie is not sure how to sort out the emotions he feels or how to communicate them effectively to civilians who have never seen combat.
As Richie searches for meaning in the war, he also searches for his own sense of self. He struggles to unravel his motivations for enlisting in the army, wondering whether his reason was a selfless one, based on the desire to earn money to provide for Kenny, or a selfish one—simply to escape from the hard life he faced in Harlem. Richie also forces himself to confront the uncomfortable question of what he will do when he returns to civilian life. Though he is highly intelligent and highly motivated and has ambitions to become a writer, his family is too poor to send him to college. Richie’s father abandoned the family years ago, and his mother has since become an alcoholic. Richie is afraid that without an education he has no career potential, and he is unsure what he has to look forward to if he survives.
Richie is wounded in a battle and transferred to a hospital. During the peaceful weeks spent recuperating, he begins to remember the joys of safety and gains a new sense of the horrors of war. When he is declared healthy and ordered to rejoin his unit, he wonders how he can possibly go back into combat and considers deserting the army. In the end, though, he rejoins his unit as ordered.
Back with his unit, Richie learns that the old squad leader, Sergeant Simpson, has been sent home. His replacement is the racist Sergeant Dongan, who always places Black soldiers in the most dangerous positions. Early in their tour of duty, there are racial and ethnic tensions among the squad members, which frequently result in physical confrontations. As the squad’s bond grows stronger, however, petty prejudices begin to fade, and the squad bands together against Dongan’s racism. Soon, Dongan is killed, and the squad is placed under the command of one of its own soldiers, Corporal Brunner.
Brunner leads the men on a deadly mission to track down a group of Vietcong—North Vietnamese guerilla forces—along a river. After a series of mistakes and miscalculations, a firefight breaks out, leaving both Richie and Peewee wounded. Richie’s medical profile is finally processed while he is recovering, and Peewee’s wounds are serious enough to earn him a discharge from the army. Peewee and Richie fly home on the same plane, along with caskets containing dead soldiers. They try to stand tall for the new recruits, who are just arriving in Vietnam."
Schemes,"Each chapter of Chains opens with a date ranging from May 27, 1776, to January 19, 1777, and a quotation from a document of the time. Since the novel uses the voice of the protagonist, Isabel, it reads much like a diary. The story opens with the funeral of Mary Finch, slave owner of Isabel and her sister Ruth and former owner of their deceased mother. Mary’s nephew, Robert, sells Isabel and Ruth to a couple from New York City, the Locktons, devout Tories who scorn the American Revolution and the rebels fighting against the king. Throughout the novel, people loyal to Britain call those fighting for independence “rebels,” while the men and women fighting to be free from Britain’s rule call themselves “patriots.” 
Isabel and Ruth travel from Rhode Island to New York by boat. At the dock, Madam Lockton hits Isabel, the first of many blows. Ruth, age five, is simple-minded, so Madam keeps her near and dressed like a pretty toy, while she works Isabel hard. Isabel promised their Momma that she would always protect Ruth. Isabel meets and becomes friends with Curzon, slave to patriot Mr. Bellingham. Curzon proposes that Isabel work for the patriots by spying on the Locktons in exchange for her freedom since Isabel might overhear secret plans. Madam’s cruelty convinces Isabel to join the patriot cause.
Becky Berry, a white servant, and Lady Seymour, Mr. Lockton’s aunt, both show kindness toward Isabel and Ruth. Isabel learns that money hidden in the Locktons’ wooden crate will pay patriots to switch sides, information valuable to the patriot leaders. This scheme and the plot to assassinate George Washington lead to Lockton’s arrest, but Isabel’s role is not suspected. Each day, Isabel fetches water from the Tea Water Pump, a gathering place for slaves, and meets a kind Grandfather who gives her good advice. Grandfather often speaks of “crossing the River Jordan” as a metaphor symbolizing each slave’s path to personal freedom.
When Madam witnesses Ruth’s seizure, she immediately wants to sell her, and Isabel realizes that the list of conspirators in the library drawer could be their ticket to escape. Isabel goes straight to Colonel Regan in the patriot headquarters, who gives her the code for future visits. As the Tories’ plans are uncovered, Lockton flees the city, leaving his wife behind. Isabel and Ruth attend the public hanging of the man blamed for the assassination plot, and the British plant their navy in the harbor, preparing for war. The patriots officially declare their independence, and the city fills with soldiers.
Madam sells Ruth, or so she says, which so infuriates Isabel that she angrily confronts Madam, an act that incites injury and Isabel’s escape. Isabel runs to Colonel Regan, who cannot help her, and she is dragged to a dungeon. After three hellish days, a judge sentences Isabel to be branded with an “I” on her cheek for Insolence. The branding is so painful Isabel loses consciousness for days and wakes in Lady Seymour’s house, nursed back to health, fed, and cleaned, her cheek still burning. Isabel must return to Madam and spends the next weeks in deep sadness, ignoring Curzon and wishing ill on Colonel Regan.
Violent thunderstorms hit New York City. Curzon has joined the patriot soldiers, who lose the Battle of Brooklyn and retreat. When the British invade New York, Isabel decides to work for them instead, hoping she’ll earn her freedom this way. She reports the location of Washington’s headquarters to a British officer, hoping he will help her escape, but he cannot. Lockton returns, and the Tories celebrate victory. When the Locktons and Lady Seymour accept British and Hussein soldiers into their homes, Isabel goes to Lady Seymour’s to help her care for them.
When the Great Fire hits New York, Isabel helps Lady Seymour escape, but Lady Seymour suffers great injury and her home is destroyed, so she moves in with the Locktons, along with more British soldiers and their wives, who take over the household chores. The British capture Fort Washington and march the surviving rebels to the prison, including Curzon. As Madam holds a feast to celebrate, Isabel overhears more plans, including hopes that thousands of prisoners would starve or die of disease. As Isabel carries a bowl of food scraps to the yard, she devises a plan.
Isabel begins to visit the prison regularly, delivering food and checking on Curzon, who has been shot. She earns the trust of a guard and a patriot leader. She nurses Lady Seymour, who supports her helping the prisoners. A shop owner gives Isabel a copy of Common Sense. Isabel carries messages between the prison and patriot officers at a huge risk to herself.
On Christmas, Isabel takes a long walk near the waterfront. Madam discovers that she’s been visiting the prison and forbids her from continuing to do so, so Isabel decides she must act. That evening, Isabel bakes a bread pudding and gifts it to a family in the burned part of the city, keeping Christmas the way her Momma did. A few days later, when Captain Morse asks Isabel to deliver a message to the prisoners informing them that Washington defeated the British in Trenton, she hears the prisoners cheer with joy. Afraid for his safety, Lockton flees to England. Lady Seymour apologizes to Isabel for not protecting her more and buying her herself, but Isabel cannot forgive her. When the prison guard offers Isabel work cleaning out the cells, she wonders if it’s an opportunity to pay for her freedom.
The city plans a celebration of the queen’s birthday, including dancing, fireworks, and feasting. Lady Seymour has suffered a stroke, which has left her unable to move or speak. On the day of the ball, Captain Morse asks Isabel to deliver a coin to another officer. That officer gives Isabel a note for Captain Morse, which she puts in her pocket. At home, Madam is furious because someone told her that her slave, Isabel, is passing notes for the rebels. When Madam demands the note, Isabel tosses it into the fire, inciting Madam’s wrath. In her fury, Madam lets it slip that she still owns Ruth, who has been living in Charleston, and then she locks Isabel in the cellar. Soon, Isabel escapes, determined to find Ruth. She writes herself a pass in the library, naming herself Isabel Gardener. Lady Seymour lets her take coins to aid her flight and whispers, “Run!”
Isabel runs to the prison, claiming to be there to clean, and finds Curzon in very bad shape. She hides him in a wheelbarrow and wheels him outside. She practically carries him to the waterfront, where they must pass a group of British soldiers. As they do, fireworks from the queen’s ball light the sky and distract the soldiers. Isabel steals a boat and rows herself and Curzon to New Jersey with bleeding and frozen hands. She wakes on the other side, knowing that they are free."
Effectiveness,"The protagonist, who is named Tim O’Brien, begins by describing an event that occurred in the middle of his Vietnam experience. “The Things They Carried” catalogs the variety of things his fellow soldiers in the Alpha Company brought on their missions. Several of these things are intangible, including guilt and fear, while others are specific physical objects, including matches, morphine, M-16 rifles, and M&M’s candy.
Throughout the collection, the same characters reappear in various stories. The first member of the Alpha Company to die is Ted Lavender, a “grunt,” or low-ranking soldier, who deals with his anxiety about the war by taking tranquilizers and smoking marijuana. Lavender is shot in the head on his way back from going to the bathroom, and his superior, Lieutenant Jimmy Cross, blames himself for the tragedy. When Lavender is shot, Cross is distracting himself with thoughts of Martha, a college crush. It is revealed in “Love” that Cross’s feelings for Martha, whom he dated once before leaving for Vietnam, were never reciprocated, and that even twenty years after the war, his guilt over Lavender’s death remains.
In “On the Rainy River,” the narrator, O’Brien, explains the series of events that led him to Vietnam in the first place. He receives his draft notice in June of 1968, and his feelings of confusion drive him north to the Canadian border, which he contemplates crossing so that he will not be forced to fight in a war in which he doesn’t believe. Sitting in a rowboat with the proprietor of the Tip Top Lodge, where he stays, O’Brien decides that his guilt about avoiding the war and fear of disappointing his family are more important than his political convictions. He soon leaves, going first back home to Worthington, Minnesota and later to Vietnam.
In addition to Ted Lavender, a few other members of the Alpha Company are killed during their mission overseas, including Curt Lemon, who is killed when he steps on a rigged mortar round. Though O’Brien is not close to Lemon, in “The Dentist,” he tells a story of how Lemon, who faints before a routine checkup with an army-issued dentist, tries to save face by insisting that a perfectly good tooth be pulled. Lee Strunk, another member of the company, dies from injuries he sustains by stepping on a landmine. In “Friends,” O’Brien remembers that before Strunk was fatally hurt, Strunk and Dave Jensen had made a pact that if either man were irreparably harmed, the other man would see that he was quickly killed. However, when Strunk is actually hurt, he begs Jensen to spare him, and Jensen complies. Instead of being upset by the news of his friend’s swift death en route to treatment, Jensen is relieved.
The death that receives the most attention in The Things They Carried is that of Kiowa, a much-loved member of the Alpha Company and one of O’Brien’s closest friends. In “Speaking of Courage,” the story of Kiowa’s death is relayed in retrospect through the memory of Norman Bowker, years after the war. As Bowker drives around a lake in his Iowa hometown, he thinks that he failed to save Kiowa, who was killed when a mortar round hit and caused him to sink headfirst into a marshy field. O’Brien realizes that he has dealt with his guilt over Kiowa’s death differently than Norman Bowker in “Notes.” Just before the end of the war, O’Brien receives a long letter from Bowker that says he hasn’t found a way to make life meaningful after the war. O’Brien resolves to tell Bowker’s story, and the story of Kiowa’s death, in order to negotiate his own feelings of guilt and hollowness.
Like “Love” and “Notes,” several of O’Brien’s stories are told from a perspective twenty years after the Vietnam War, when he is a forty-three-year-old writer living in Massachusetts. Exposure to the guilt of old friends like Jimmy Cross and Norman Bowker prompts him to write stories in order to understand what they were going through. But two stories, “The Man I Killed” and “Ambush,” are written so that O’Brien can confront his own guilt over killing a man with a grenade outside the village of My Khe. In “The Man I Killed,” O’Brien imagines the life of his victim, from his childhood to the way things would have turned out for him had O’Brien not spotted him on a path and thrown a grenade at his feet. In “Ambush,” O’Brien imagines how he might relay the story of the man he killed to his nine-year-old daughter, Kathleen. In this second story, O’Brien provides more details of the actual killing—including the sound of the grenade and his own feelings—and explains that even well after the fact, he hasn’t finished sorting out the experience.
In the last story, “The Lives of the Dead,” O’Brien gives another twist to his contention that stories have the power to save people. In the stories of Curt Lemon and Kiowa, O’Brien explains that his imagination allowed him to grapple successfully with his guilt and confusion over the death of his fourth-grade first love, Linda."
Inflict,"In “moon,” the first of the four parts of feed, an American teenager named Titus travels to the lunar surface with his high-school friends for spring break, hoping to escape the boredom they feel on Earth. No specific date is revealed, though it’s sometime in a dystopic future, where the moon is fully commercialized and people suffer from red sores called lesions. As Titus and his fellow upper-class friends Link, Marty, Calista, Loga, and Quendy arrive on the moon, readers also get their first glimpse of “the feed.” Although Titus doesn’t initially reveal exact details about the feed or how it works, he says it sends the friends ads and images for where to stay and shop. 
After failing to get into college-age parties, the group visits the Ricochet Lounge, where Titus becomes infatuated with a girl named Violet. She is beautiful and, he soon finds, visiting the moon by herself and is very unlike his friends: She doesn’t make pointless purchases at a mall they all soon visit and isn’t interested in malfunctioning, or falling into a drug-like stupor, via their connections to the feed. Later, when they all visit a dance club called the Rumble Spot, an old man from a dissenter group called the Coalition of Pity hacks into people’s individual feeds, causing them to broadcast the signal, “we enter a time of calamity” over the feed’s network. Police beat the man and “shut off” those hacked, including Titus and Violet, who hold hands as they collapse.
Part 2, “eden,” occurs in a lunar hospital where Violet, Titus, and his friends remain disconnected from the feed until their systems can be scanned for viruses. There, Titus provides additional details about what the feed is and how it works. Feeds are implanted inside the body and connect to a global network that provides news, entertainment, and a means to purchase every kind of product, he says while singing its praises. The feed even anticipates and creates users’ wants from individual profiles based on purchasing decisions, thoughts, and feelings. Titus and Violet grow closer during the stay. Violet, who’s home-schooled and smarter than Titus and his friends, says she hoped to enjoy herself like normal kids but now has a problem, though she remains vague about what this problem is. When doctors finally restore the friends’ feeds, they rejoice. Promotions begin to flow through their minds again, though there’s also ominous news concerning protests over America’s annexation of the moon and resulting anger from a group called the Global Alliance. Still, Titus says, the friends exalt in the return of their feeds.
In Part 3, “Utopia,” Titus and his friends return to Earth and life returns to normal for them: “upcars” travel in tubes past vertically stacked suburbs, the friends party, and U.S. President Trumbull scoffs at reports that claim toxic industries cause lesions. In defiance of rampant consumerism and a loss of individuality, Violet determines to resist the feed by creating a completely random customer profile and asks Titus to join her. Violet, who didn’t receive her feed until she was seven, voices deep concern about the decline of the world and destruction of Earth, and laments how those who’ve had the feed their entire lives are ignorant and self-centered. Titus soon has nightmares that are more likely hacks from the Coalition of Pity. In them, he sees disturbing images of eco destruction and human suffering around the world, but after Violet chats him, saying she has seen the images too, he only wants to go back to sleep.
Before long, Violet’s problem becomes clear: Her body begins to fail and she’s told by doctors that the damage to her feedware can be fatal. The prognosis makes Violet realize how much she wants to do. She starts by going to the seashore with Titus, though they need to dress in protective suits due to its toxicity. Meanwhile, feed chatter reveals that all of Earth’s forests have fallen and there is a growing rift between the U.S. and the Global Alliance. At a party where Quendy shows off her artificial lesions, Violet becomes outraged and her body falters. She chastises Titus and his friends for living in ignorance as the world dies, then collapses and is brought to the hospital. 
Violet’s condition declines further in Part 4, “slumberland,” whose chapter titles track her feed efficiency from a high of 87.3 percent to a low of 4.6 percent, 98 percent being optimal. Aware that she doesn’t have much time, Violet messages Titus a list of twenty-two things she wants to do in life, though he grows increasingly distant, and doesn’t message back. When they do reconnect, Violet sends Titus a recent memory where she falls down a staircase and receives a response from the corporation FeedTech, denying her petition to pay for her system repairs because she wasn’t deemed to be worthy due to her random customer profile. Violet later sends Titus childhood memories to preserve her history, though he deletes them. And when Violet convinces him to visit the mountains with her, one of her life goals, Titus breaks up with her, saying he was only interested in a short relationship while she wanted something eternal. 
Time passes and Titus eventually hears from Violet’s father. At Violet’s home, Titus sees her lying on a floating bed, completely pale, fully incapacitated, and covered in discs. Her father details her final, painful days and how her body failed. He then berates Titus for how badly he treated Violet and for willfully living in ignorance. Titus later visits Violet’s home a second time. Although she appears dead, her feed efficiency is at 4.6 percent and a screen shows that her heart is beating slightly. Nevertheless, Titus tells Violet a story he plans to keep telling her, he says, so she will remember herself. The story is about Violet, the end of America, and their relationship, where they learn something important about love and how to resist the feed. The book ends with a promotion on the feed for Blue-Jean Warehouse’s Final Sales Event and a recurring, fading message that “Everything must go.”"
Seat,"Brian Robeson, a thirteen-year-old from New York City, boards a plan headed from Hampton, New York to the Canadian north woods to visit his father. His parents' recent divorce weighs heavily on him, as does ""The Secret"" that his mother is having an affair. The pilot gives him a very brief flying lesson in which Brian has control of the plane for a few minutes. The pilot seems to be experiencing increasing pain in his shoulder, arm, and stomach. At first Brian does not think it is very serious, but as the pilot begins jerking in his seat it becomes clear that he is having a heart attack. The attack stops and the pilot is dead; Brian is forced to take over the controls. After a harrowing descent, the plane crashes into a lake in the Canadian woods, where Brian is stranded.
Brian has little to eat and is injured from the crash, but believes he will soon be rescued. He finds some strange berries to eat, which make him extremely sick. He then finds a raspberry patch, where he spots a bear. Brian constructs a shelter and in the middle of the night he hears a noise. A porcupine has entered his shelter and Brian throws the hatchet in its direction. It shoots its quills into Brian's leg, causing him severe pain. Brian attempts to build a fire with no matches and eventually succeeds when he learns how to strike his hatchet against a stone to ignite sparks. He finds turtle eggs and eagerly eats them. One day a plane flies overhead but does not see him and continues on its way, leaving Brian devastated and hopeless. He attempts to commit suicide by cutting himself with his hatchet, but survives the attempt and emerges from the experience determined to embrace life and to take an active role in his own fate.
Brian soon catches his first fish and enjoys a big feast. That night, however, a skunk enters the shelter and when Brian yells at the skunk, it sprays him, temporarily blinding him and covering him with a horrible stench. Brian perfects his tools and catches a foolbird, his first meat. While he is cleaning the bird in the water, a moose attacks Brian, injuring his ribs and his shoulder. Another unfortunate incident soon follows when a tornado sweeps over the woods and destroys Brian's shelter.
The day after the tornado, Brian discovers that the chaotic storm has riled up the water in the lake, and the tail of the plane had emerged from the lake, reminding Brian of the dead pilot and compelling him to say a few words for him. Lying in bed one night, it occurs to Brian that he could seek out the survival pack in the body of the plane, and he determines to build a raft to do so. After many incidents of trial-and-error, Brian retrieves the survival pack from the plane. At one point he drops the hatchet to the lake's bottom, but retrieves it with a long dive. On his way back up to the surface, Brian sees the dead pilot's head underwater, partially eaten by fish. Brian gets sick in the water but manages to make it back to his shelter to get some sleep.
The next morning Brian opens the survival pack, which contains countless useful items, some of which Brian rejects in favor of the self-sufficient methods he has developed during his time in the woods. However, there is freeze-dried food that he decides to cook immediately. He also finds something labeled ""Emergency Transmitter."" He fiddles with it but it appears not to function. As Brian is preparing his much-anticipated meal, a plane lands on the lake to rescue a dumbfounded Brian sitting down to eat his freeze-dried meal."
Reputation,"Guy Montag is a fireman who burns books in a futuristic American city. In Montag’s world, firemen start fires rather than putting them out. The people in this society do not read books, enjoy nature, spend time by themselves, think independently, or have meaningful conversations. Instead, they drive very fast, watch excessive amounts of television on wall-size sets, and listen to the radio on “Seashell Radio” sets attached to their ears.
Montag encounters a gentle seventeen-year-old girl named Clarisse McClellan, who opens his eyes to the emptiness of his life with her innocently penetrating questions and her unusual love of people and nature. Over the next few days, Montag experiences a series of disturbing events. First, his wife, Mildred, attempts suicide by swallowing a bottle of sleeping pills. Then, when he responds to an alarm that an old woman has a stash of hidden literature, the woman shocks him by choosing to be burned alive along with her books. A few days later, he hears that Clarisse has been killed by a speeding car. Montag’s dissatisfaction with his life increases, and he begins to search for a solution in a stash of books that he has stolen from his own fires and hidden inside an air-conditioning vent.
When Montag fails to show up for work, his fire chief, Beatty, pays a visit to his house. Beatty explains that it’s normal for a fireman to go through a phase of wondering what books have to offer, and he delivers a dizzying monologue explaining how books came to be banned in the first place. According to Beatty, special-interest groups and other “minorities” objected to books that offended them. Soon, books all began to look the same, as writers tried to avoid offending anybody. This was not enough, however, and society as a whole decided to simply burn books rather than permit conflicting opinions. Beatty tells Montag to take twenty-four hours or so to see if his stolen books contain anything worthwhile and then turn them in for incineration. Montag begins a long and frenzied night of reading.
Overwhelmed by the task of reading, Montag looks to his wife for help and support, but she prefers television to her husband’s company and cannot understand why he would want to take the terrible risk of reading books. He remembers that he once met a retired English professor named Faber sitting in a park, and he decides that this man might be able to help him understand what he reads. He visits Faber, who tells him that the value of books lies in the detailed awareness of life that they contain. Faber says that Montag needs not only books but also the leisure to read them and the freedom to act upon their ideas.
Faber agrees to help Montag with his reading, and they concoct a risky scheme to overthrow the status quo. Faber will contact a printer and begin reproducing books, and Montag will plant books in the homes of firemen to discredit the profession and to destroy the machinery of censorship. Faber gives him a two-way radio earpiece (the “green bullet”) so that he can hear what Montag hears and talk to him secretly.
Montag goes home, and soon two of his wife’s friends arrive to watch television. The women discuss their families and the war that is about to be declared in an extremely frivolous manner. Their superficiality angers him, and he takes out a book of poetry and reads “Dover Beach” by Matthew Arnold. Faber buzzes in his ear for him to be quiet, and Mildred tries to explain that the poetry reading is a standard way for firemen to demonstrate the uselessness of literature. The women are extremely disturbed by the poem and leave to file a complaint against Montag.
Montag goes to the fire station and hands over one of his books to Beatty. Beatty confuses Montag by barraging him with contradictory quotations from great books. Beatty exploits these contradictions to show that literature is morbid and dangerously complex, and that it deserves incineration. Suddenly, the alarm sounds, and they rush off to answer the call, only to find that the alarm is at Montag’s own house. Mildred gets into a cab with her suitcase, and Montag realizes that his own wife has betrayed him.
Beatty forces Montag to burn the house himself; when he is done, Beatty places him under arrest. When Beatty continues to berate Montag, Montag turns the flamethrower on his superior and proceeds to burn him to ashes. Montag knocks the other firemen unconscious and runs. The Mechanical Hound, a monstrous machine that Beatty has set to attack Montag, pounces and injects Montag’s leg with a large dose of anesthetic. Montag manages to destroy it with his flamethrower; then he walks off the numbness in his leg and escapes with some books that were hidden in his backyard. He hides these in another fireman’s house and calls in an alarm from a pay phone.
Montag goes to Faber’s house, where he learns that a new Hound has been put on his trail, along with several helicopters and a television crew. Faber tells Montag that he is leaving for St. Louis to see a retired printer who may be able to help them. Montag gives Faber some money and tells him how to remove Montag’s scent from his house so the Hound will not enter it. Montag then takes some of Faber’s old clothes and runs off toward the river. The whole city watches as the chase unfolds on TV, but Montag manages to escape in the river and change into Faber’s clothes to disguise his scent. He drifts downstream into the country and follows a set of abandoned railroad tracks until he finds a group of renegade intellectuals (“the Book People”), led by a man named Granger, who welcome him. They are a part of a nationwide network of book lovers who have memorized many great works of literature and philosophy. They hope that they may be of some help to mankind in the aftermath of the war that has just been declared. Montag’s role is to memorize the Book of Ecclesiastes. Enemy jets appear in the sky and completely obliterate the city with bombs. Montag and his new friends move on to search for survivors and rebuild civilization."
Arises,"The Sun Also Rises opens with the narrator, Jake Barnes, delivering a brief biographical sketch of his friend, Robert Cohn. Jake is a veteran of World War I who now works as a journalist in Paris. Cohn is also an American expatriate, although not a war veteran. He is a rich Jewish writer who lives in Paris with his forceful and controlling girlfriend, Frances Clyne. Cohn has become restless of late, and he comes to Jake’s office one afternoon to try to convince Jake to go with him to South America. Jake refuses, and he takes pains to get rid of Cohn. That night at a dance club, Jake runs into Lady Brett Ashley, a divorced socialite and the love of Jake’s life. Brett is a free-spirited and independent woman, but she can be very selfish at times. She and Jake met in England during World War I, when Brett treated Jake for a war wound. During Jake and Brett’s conversation, it is subtly implied that Jake’s injury rendered him impotent. Although Brett loves Jake, she hints that she is unwilling to give up sex, and that for this reason she will not commit to a relationship with him.
The next morning, Jake and Cohn have lunch. Cohn is quite taken with Brett, and he gets angry when Jake tells him that Brett plans to marry Mike Campbell, a heavy-drinking Scottish war veteran. That afternoon, Brett stands Jake up. That night, however, she arrives unexpectedly at his apartment with Count Mippipopolous, a rich Greek expatriate. After sending the count out for champagne, Brett tells Jake that she is leaving for San Sebastian, in Spain, saying it will be easier on both of them to be apart.
Several weeks later, while Brett and Cohn are both traveling outside of Paris, one of Jake’s friends, a fellow American war veteran named Bill Gorton, arrives in Paris. Bill and Jake make plans to leave for Spain to do some fishing and later attend the fiesta at Pamplona. Jake makes plans to meet Cohn on the way to Pamplona. Jake runs into Brett, who has returned from San Sebastian; with her is Mike, her fiancé. They ask if they may join Jake in Spain, and he politely responds that they may. When Mike leaves for a moment, Brett reveals to Jake that she and Cohn were in San Sebastian together.
Bill and Jake take a train from Paris to Bayonne, in the south of France, where they meet Cohn. The three men travel together into Spain, to Pamplona. They plan on meeting Brett and Mike that night, but the couple does not show up. Bill and Jake decide to leave for a small town called Burguete to fish, but Cohn chooses to stay and wait for Brett. Bill and Jake travel to the Spanish countryside and check into a small, rural inn. They spend five pleasant days fishing, drinking, and playing cards. Eventually, Jake receives a letter from Mike. He writes that he and Brett will be arriving in Pamplona shortly. Jake and Bill leave on a bus that afternoon to meet the couple. After arriving in Pamplona, Jake and Bill check into a hotel owned by Montoya, a Spanish bullfighting expert who likes Jake for his earnest interest in the sport. Jake and Bill meet up with Brett, Mike, and Cohn, and the whole group goes to watch the bulls being unloaded in preparation for the bullfights during the fiesta. Mike mocks Cohn harshly for following Brett around when he is not wanted.
After a few more days of preparation, the fiesta begins. The city is consumed with dancing, drinking, and general debauchery. The highlight of the first day is the first bullfight, at which Pedro Romero, a nineteen-year-old prodigy, distinguishes himself above all the other bullfighters. Despite its violence, Brett cannot take her eyes off the bullfight, or Romero. A few days later, Jake and his friends are at the hotel dining room, and Brett notices Romero at a nearby table. She persuades Jake to introduce her to him. Mike again verbally abuses Cohn, and they almost come to blows before Jake defuses the situation. Later that night, Brett asks Jake to help her find Romero, with whom she says she has fallen in love. Jake agrees to help, and Brett and Romero spend the night together.
Jake then meets up with Mike and Bill, who are both extremely drunk. Cohn soon arrives, demanding to know where Brett is. After an exchange of insults, Cohn attacks Mike and Jake, knocking them both out. When Jake returns to the hotel, he finds Cohn lying face down on his bed and crying. Cohn begs Jake’s forgiveness, and Jake reluctantly grants it. The next day, Jake learns from Bill and Mike that the night before Cohn also beat up Romero when he discovered the bullfighter with Brett; Cohn later begged Romero to shake hands with him, but Romero refused.
At the bullfight that afternoon, Romero fights brilliantly, dazzling the crowd by killing a bull that had gored a man to death in the streets. Afterward, he cuts the bull’s ear off and gives it to Brett. After this final bullfight, Romero and Brett leave for Madrid together. Cohn has left that morning, so only Bill, Mike, and Jake remain as the fiesta draws to a close.
The next day, the three remaining men rent a car and drive out of Spain to Bayonne and then go their separate ways. Jake heads back into Spain to San Sebastian, where he plans to spend several quiet days relaxing. He receives a telegram from Brett, however, asking him to come meet her in Madrid. He complies, and boards an overnight train that same day. Jake finds Brett alone in a Madrid hotel room. She has broken with Romero, fearing that she would ruin him and his career. She announces that she now wants to return to Mike. Jake books tickets for them to leave Madrid. As they ride in a taxi through the Spanish capital, Brett laments that she and Jake could have had a wonderful time together. Jake responds, “Yes, isn’t it pretty to think so?”"
Artillery,"The Killer Angels tells the story of the Battle of Gettysburg. On July 1, 1863, the Army of Northern Virginia, or Confederate army, and the Army of the Potomac, or Union army, fought the largest battle of the American Civil War. When the battle ended, 51,000 men were dead, wounded, or missing. All the characters in the novel are based on real historical figures. They include General Robert E. Lee, commander of the Confederate army; General James Longstreet, Lee’s second in command; and Union Colonel Joshua L. Chamberlain, who participated in one of the most famous segments of the Battle of Gettysburg, the fighting on Little Round Top.
	The story begins on June 29, 1863. A spy comes to Longstreet and informs him that he has seen the Union army moving nearby. This information surprises Longstreet, because General J. E. B. Stuart is supposed to be tracking the Union army with his cavalry. Longstreet thinks the Confederate army must quickly move north to intercept the Union. The Confederates swing southeast through the mountains and toward a small town called Gettysburg.
	Miles south of Gettysburg, Union Colonel Joshua L. Chamberlain awakes to discover that his regiment, the Twentieth Maine, has a hundred new members—mutineers from the Second Maine. Chamberlain gives them a brief speech, asking them to continue to fight, and all but six of the men join the Twentieth Maine freely.
	In Gettysburg, General John Buford, leader of the Union cavalry, rides into the town and discovers Confederate troops nearby. He realizes that the two armies may end up fighting in the town, so he takes his two brigades—approximately 2,000 men—and positions the soldiers along the hills in the area. He knows that having high ground is the key to winning the battle, since it is easier to fight from above than below. In the Confederate camp, Longstreet meets with George Pickett and several other generals.
	On the morning of July 1, Lee rises and curses Stuart’s absence. He is blind without Stuart, because without him he has no idea where the Union army is. He meets with Longstreet, who wants to swing southeast and come between the Union army and Washington, D.C. Then, Longstreet says, the Confederates can use defensive tactics and have a much better chance of winning the battle. Lee refuses, because he wants to smash the Union army aggressively in one decisive stroke.
	Meanwhile, the battle begins at Gettysburg when the Confederates attack Buford’s men. Buford holds the Confederates off until infantry General John Reynolds arrives. Reynolds positions his troops and fights the Confederates off, but he is soon killed. Lee arrives in Gettysburg and finds the battle in full fury. Two other Confederate generals arrive and send word to Lee that they have engaged the Union troops, who continue to pour in from the south. Lee orders his generals to attack. Meanwhile, Chamberlain’s regiment begins to move northward toward Gettysburg.
	The first day’s battle ends with the Union forces retreating into the hills surrounding Gettysburg. There they dig in, setting up cannons and defensive stone walls. Longstreet is nervous—he knows that the hills are good defensive positions, and he knows that Lee plans to attack them rather than swing the army southeast toward Washington, D.C. Lee meets with his generals and is angry with General Ewell for not following his orders and taking Cemetery Hill and Culp’s Hill, thereby instead allowing the Union forces to retreat into them. Ewell is a cautious general, perhaps too cautious. Meanwhile, Buford returns to the Union camp to discover that he is being blamed for the day’s loss.
	On July 2, Chamberlain awakes and his regiment begins moving north again toward Gettysburg. On the way, his regiment discovers an escaped slave, and Chamberlain muses on the reasons behind the war and his thoughts on race. Back at Gettysburg, two of Lee’s generals—Ewell and Early—suggest that the army strike the Union’s two flanks in order to weaken it. Lee likes the plan, but Longstreet still wants to move southeast toward Washington, D.C. Lee refuses, and Longstreet reluctantly agrees to attack the Union’s left flank. As he leads his troops toward the hills to the south of Gettysburg, Little Round Top and Big Round Top, he discovers that the army has come down off the hills and into the peach orchard at the bottom. He decides he has no choice but to attack anyway, and a bloodbath on both sides is the result.
	Chamberlain’s regiment finally reaches Gettysburg and is placed on Little Round Top. Chamberlain is told that he is the extreme left of the Union line, which means he can never retreat. Chamberlain and his men hold the hill against numerous Confederate attacks, but eventually they run out of bullets. Chamberlain orders a bayonet charge, and his screaming regiment, charging down the hill, frightens the Confederates into fleeing. The Union still controls Little Round Top at the end of the day, and Longstreet’s men have suffered heavy losses in the peach orchard. That night, Stuart returns, and Lee scolds him for being absent. Lee then decides on a plan for the next day: now that he has battered the two flanks of the Union army, the middle must be weakened. He will charge through the middle of the Union line and split the army in two, then destroy each half individually.
	The next morning, July 3, Chamberlain’s men are moved to the center of the Union line, where it is supposed to be safe and quiet. At the Confederate camp, Longstreet tries to convince Lee one last time to swing the army toward Washington, D.C., but Lee again refuses. He is intent on attacking his enemy. Longstreet tells Lee that he is certain Lee’s plan is doomed to failure, but Lee obstinately refuses to budge. Longstreet reluctantly agrees to attack the center of the line and places Pickett in charge of the assault.
	The Confederates begin with an artillery barrage in an attempt to weaken the Union artillery on the other side. Chamberlain finds himself and his regiment in the middle of this bombardment, much to his surprise, but he survives intact. Since the Confederate artillery shoots too high, not much damage is dealt to the Union batteries. The Confederate attack begins as the troops start marching across the open field toward the Union troops. The Union begins firing cannons, blowing huge holes in the Confederate line and killing hundreds of men. When the Confederates come within range, the Union soldiers open fire with their guns, killing hundreds more. Pickett loses sixty percent of his division. The Confederates soon retreat, and the Battle of Gettysburg comes to its bloody, spectacular end."
Heated,"Matilda Cook is a fourteen-year-old girl living in Philadelphia in 1793. Matilda’s mother, Lucille, manages the coffeehouse, and they live above the shop with Grandfather, Matilda’s deceased father’s father, who fought in the war. Matilda dreams of one day owning her own shops and traveling to Paris, but for now she helps Mother in the coffeehouse, where she is often berated for being too slow or too lazy. The coffeehouse’s cook, Eliza, is a formerly enslaved Black woman whose husband died before she could buy him his freedom. Matilda and her family also have a serving girl, Polly, who was Matilda’s childhood friend. One day, Polly fails show up at the coffeehouse. Mother goes to see where Polly is and comes back with news that Polly died from a sudden fever. Matilda feels very sad and asks to see Polly’s family or go to her funeral, but Mother doesn’t want Matilda going anywhere near a house that could contain sick people.
As Matilda serves the customers in the coffeehouse, she hears them talking about a new disease spreading around the city, and some believe it is yellow fever. More and more people continue to catch the disease and die. Mother considers sending Matilda to the Ludington family’s farm, where she will be farther away from the disease, but Matilda doesn’t want to leave. However, not long after, Mother becomes ill with the fever and insists that Matilda leave her so that she will not get sick as well. Matilda and Grandfather leave Philadelphia with a farmer and his wife to go to the Ludington farm. Grandfather begins coughing on the journey and blames it on the heat. But when the wagon is stopped by several men who are monitoring who goes in and out of the local town, the men hear Grandfather’s coughing and refuse to let him pass. The farmer leaves Grandfather and Matilda behind on the road several miles outside Philadelphia.
Matilda and Grandfather rest in the shade of a tree while Matilda thinks about what to do next. She gathers water for them to drink at a stream and collects berries for them to eat. Grandfather seems weak and at times disoriented but does not show any signs of yellow fever. After trying to find food from local farmers, Matilda returns to Grandfather and collapses. She wakes up several days later in a hospital and learns that she has yellow fever, but Grandfather does not. He explains that his recent cough was caused by heart problems. While Matilda recovers, a clerk tells her that she should go live at the orphan house since she cannot find Mother, but Grandfather protests, insisting that he’ll take care of Matilda.
Once Matilda is fully recovered, she and Grandfather return to Philadelphia. They find that the city has changed very much since they departed. Many businesses have closed. Empty houses are boarded up to prevent thieves from breaking in. When Grandfather and Matilda return to their coffeehouse, they see that it has been broken into and all of their food and several possessions have been stolen. Matilda finds some food in the withered garden and cares for Grandfather. One night, two men break into the house while Matilda is sleeping on the first floor. Matilda hides, but the men soon realize she’s there. They trap her and try to make her tell them where she’s hidden her money. Woken by the noise, Grandfather comes downstairs with his rifle and shoots. One of the men attacks Grandfather, but Matilda stabs the man in the shoulder with Grandfather’s sword, which the men had planned to steal. The men leave when Matilda threatens to kill them. Grandfather, who was knocked back by the shot of the rifle and who has already been having heart troubles, dies. Matilda brings his body outside to be buried in a mass grave the next day.
On her way home from overseeing Grandfather’s burial, Matilda sees a young girl crying. She learns that the girl’s name is Nell and that Nell’s mother is dead. While trying to find someone to take in Nell, Matilda sees Eliza in the distance and follows her until she catches up. Eliza allows Matilda and Nell to stay with her and her brother Joseph’s family. Matilda becomes attached to Nell but knows she’s not ready to take care of a child, so Matilda brings Nell to the orphan house. However, after the woman at the orphan house says they can’t take in any more children, Matilda brings Nell back to Eliza’s brother’s house, secretly relieved.
Matilda begins helping Eliza with her volunteer work for the Free African Society, caring for patients with yellow fever. One day, Matilda and Eliza return home to find that Joseph’s sons and Nell have the fever. Knowing the children need to get out of the heat to survive, Matilda and Eliza bring the children to the coffeehouse, where it is cooler. The first frost soon arrives, an event that people believe will bring an end to the epidemic. The children eventually recover.
After the epidemic ends, Matilda reopens the coffeehouse with Eliza as her partner and begins spending more time with a local painter’s apprentice, Nathaniel Benson. One day, Nathaniel comes in the coffeehouse to announce that President Washington has returned to Philadelphia. Everyone rushes outside to catch a glimpse of the president. On their way back to the coffeehouse, a carriage arrives and Matilda’s mother steps out. Mother left for the Ludington farm shortly after Matilda and Grandfather did and tried to track them down when she realized they were not there, which only made her weaker. She recovered at the Ludingtons’ and returned to Philadelphia as soon as she could. With Mother needing more rest than before, Matilda continues running the coffeehouse and caring for Nell as the city moves on from the epidemic."
Silenced,"Shūsaku Endō’s Silence takes place in Japan during the 1600s, shortly after the Japanese government suppressed the Shimabara Rebellion, in which Christian Japanese peasants rebelled against the government’s heavy persecution. After the rebellion’s defeat, many Catholics went underground, continuing to practice their religion in secrecy. The novel begins when a young Portuguese Jesuit missionary, Sebastian Rodrigues, and his two colleagues, Father Garrpe and Father de Santa Maria, decide to set out to Japan to find out what happened to their teacher, Father Ferreira. Ferreira is rumored to have apostatized, or renounced his religious beliefs, after having gone underground in Japan and spent thirty years in Christian service there. Rodrigues finds it hard to believe that Ferreira, a highly respected member of the Jesuit community, has renounced his faith. If he has, Rodrigues wonders what this means about his faith in Christianity and the religion he has dedicated his life to.
Rodrigues, Garrpe, and de Santa Maria head to Japan by way of the Chinese port city Macao. There, they meet with Father Valignano, a rector of the Jesuit college in the city. Valignano is against sending the priests to Japan—a new magistrate, Inoue, is rumored to be especially brutal, exacting and devising some of the most brutal forms of Christian persecution ever performed. Rodrigues persists, and Valignano relents, sympathizing with Rodrigues’s desire to find out about Ferreira once and for all. The men arrange for a ship and hire a Japanese man they find wandering around town, Kichijiro, as a guide and interpreter. Kichijiro turns out to be a lazy drunk—he pretends to work when people are watching him but otherwise lies around drinking. During a violent storm, the men catch Kichijiro muttering Latin prayers and ask him if he is Catholic, but Kichijiro remains silent, though he has a pained look on his face. De Santa Maria, sick with suspected malaria, stays behind.
The men arrive at the village of Tomogi, where they find the villagers are practicing Christianity in secret. Two men in particular, Mokichi and Ichizo, are respected Christian leaders in the town. The men help situate Rodrigues and Garrpe in a charcoal hut on the hillside, away from the authorities. There, Rodrigues and Garrpe perform mass and hear confessions. Meanwhile, Kichijiro spreads the word to other towns that the priests have arrived, and villagers from other towns come to the priests’ hut. Soon, the government finds out that Christian priests have arrived, and a group of guards come to search the village. The officials demand that the town turn over the priests in three days and in the meantime select three hostages for the guards to take away. Mokichi and Ichizo volunteer, while the village selects Kichijiro as a third. Crestfallen and angry, Kichijiro joins the men in Nagasaki, where they are forced to apostatize at the magistrate’s office. Only Kichijiro apostatizes. Mokichi and Ichizo are returned to Tomogi, where they are subjected to the water torture and left to die. Rodrigues watches the whole affair from his hut, wondering why God is silent in the face of such meaningless suffering. For the first time, Rodrigues questions his faith.
Rodrigues and Garrpe decide to split up to avoid capture. Rodrigues wanders an abandoned village where he finds Kichijiro again, begging for absolution for his sin. Rodrigues is confused by Kichijiro and wonders if he’s about to trap him. His suspicions turn out to be correct—Kichijiro has led a group of soldiers to Rodrigues that entraps him and brings him to prison. At the prison, Rodrigues is surprised to find the guards allow him to practice his priestly duties. He wonders why they are treating him so kindly. Rodrigues is brought before a tribunal of samurai who cross-examine Rodrigues. Rodrigues argues his case that Christianity is a “universal truth” that deserves to be spread to Japan, but one samurai gently argues that this isn’t the case—Christianity cannot thrive in Japan, and it’s not needed there. Rodrigues is shocked to find the man arguing before him is Inoue, the man rumored for his heinous cruelty. Inoue says he doesn’t intend to kill anyone without sufficient reason, and he’s hoping that Rodrigues instead comes to reason and decides to apostatize.
Several days later, at Inoue’s request, Rodrigues is brought by the Interpreter to an overlook of the ocean. Rodrigues watches as a group of prisoners are led to the shore, where they are wrapped in straw mats and loaded onto a boat. With them is Garrpe. The guards below order Garrpe to apostatize, but he refuses. The guards then row the boat out to dump the prisoners overboard. Garrpe swims after them in a panic and drowns. As Rodrigues watches the horrible scene unfold, the Interpreter tells him that the prisoners’ blood is on the priests’ hands. To add insult to injury, he adds that Garrpe at least showed bravery, while Rodrigues sits in silence, doing nothing for the peasants. Rodrigues sits for days in prison, numb to his situation and God’s persistent silence. He is then brought to meet Ferreira, whom he learns has taken a Japanese name and is writing a book against Christianity. Rodrigues is shocked—he can’t believe his former teacher has apostatized and now works for the Japanese government. Ferreira, visibly shaken, argues that apostasy is inevitable since Christianity is incompatible with Eastern views.
Finally, Rodrigues is taken to prison in Inoue’s house. There, he struggles to decide whether to apostatize. While sitting in his cell, he hears the sounds of what he thinks is snoring, but Ferreira, who is sitting outside Rodrigues’s cell, tells him it’s not snoring but the sound of Christians being hung upside down in a pit and tortured until Rodrigues gives in. Rodrigues, overcome, decides to apostatize. He can’t bear to let any more people suffer on his behalf. Rodrigues is taken to Nagasaki, where he is given a new Japanese name and wife. He and Ferreira live out their days employed by the government helping identify smuggled Christian goods that come in via European ships. Kichijiro comes to Rodrigues’s door one last time asking for forgiveness. Rodrigues agrees, resolved that he has come to a deeper understanding of faith in his heart, and for this reason, is a true testament to the faith, even within Japan’s borders."
Settlement,"Margery Kempe is a well-off middle-class townswoman in the medieval English town of King’s Lynn. After the birth of her first child, Margery has a nervous breakdown, seeing hideous devils all around her. Margery recovers after having a vision of Jesus Christ, and she decides to devote her life to holiness and contemplation of God. One of the first hurdles Margery has to overcome is convincing her husband to live a life of celibacy with her—she succeeds only after having fourteen children. After the failure of a brewing business she starts, Margery becomes certain that God wants her to turn away from the world. Margery’s devotion to Jesus is highly emotional and dramatic, and she soon acquires a reputation as a religious eccentric, a potentially dangerous reputation in a time when heresy was a capital offense. Margery faces doubt and temptation, especially sexual temptation, but she perseveres and often receives guidance in her visions.
Margery makes several pilgrimages, the longest and most difficult of which is a journey to Jerusalem, with a long stopover in Rome. During the pilgrimage, Margery is shunned by her fellow travelers but is often accepted by the poor, a pattern that repeats itself throughout her life. In Jerusalem, Margery has several intense visions, and she begins to have spells in which she sobs and cries uncontrollably. These crying fits come upon her most often during religious services, but they also occur whenever she simply thinks of Jesus or sees something that reminds her of his suffering. Margery is stranded in Rome for a time after giving away her money to the poor, and she makes her way by begging. Margery’s extreme behavior begins to make her notorious, and she makes enemies among the English contingent in Rome. Eventually, Margery is given enough money to return home.
Upon her return to England, Margery does her best to live a life of devotion to Christ. As a married woman, however, she is somewhat constrained, such as by the fact that she cannot become a nun. Margery travels to various churches and holy sites in England, attracting attention wherever she goes, thanks to her public weeping and her all-white wardrobe. At times, Margery is accepted as a holy woman, and her advice and blessings are solicited. More often, she is treated as an oddity or a nuisance and mocked. On occasion, the hostile attention she draws goes beyond mockery. Traveling through the north of England, Margery is arrested several times and almost burned at the stake as a heretic, though she is saved by the intervention of the church authorities. Each time she is arrested, Margery defends herself vigorously. She is respectful to authority but firm in her beliefs, none of which are heretical, as her examiners soon see.
Margery continues to have mystical visions of Jesus, the Virgin Mary, and several saints. Margery’s devotion to Christ is particularly intense and is expressed in highly physical, even sexual, terms. In her visions, Margery often sees herself as a servant to Mary or Jesus, acting as an eyewitness to the events of the gospels. Jesus speaks to Margery in her visions of such subjects as the Trinity, the salvation and damnation of souls, and the meaning of the constant tears he sends her. Margery tries to spend as much time as she can in prayer or in conversation with her spiritual guides. Even so, her dramatic weeping in church and elsewhere continues to draw attention and, often, censure. Margery comes into particular conflict with a friar who moves to Lynn and refuses to allow Margery to hear him preach because of her disruptive weeping.
As time goes on, Margery’s husband becomes old and infirm, and Margery returns to his household to care for him. One of Margery’s sons turns from his sinful ways after much praying and beseeching by Margery, and he marries a German woman. The couple comes to England for a visit, and the son takes ill and dies, soon followed by his father. In her last extended journey, Margery accompanies her daughter-in-law (who is less than enthusiastic about being joined by her odd mother-in-law) back to Germany, only deciding to leave at the last minute. Margery’s trip overland from Germany to France is her most grueling yet, and she is again scorned by other travelers from England, to whom she turns for help. Eventually, Margery makes it to London and finally back to Lynn. Home once again, Margery, now an old woman, decides to record the story of her life and her devotions, and begins the dictation of her Book."
Chairs,"Our Town is introduced and narrated by the Stage Manager, who welcomes the audience to the fictional town of Grover’s Corners, New Hampshire, early on a May morning in 1901. In the opening scene, the stage is largely empty, except for some tables and chairs that represent the homes of the Gibbs and Webb families, the setting of most of the action in Act I. The set remains sparse throughout the rest of the play.
	After the Stage Manager’s introduction, the activities of a typical day begin. Howie Newsome, the milkman, and Joe Crowell, Jr., the paperboy, make their delivery rounds. Dr. Gibbs returns from delivering a set of twins at one of the homes in town. Mrs. Gibbs and Mrs. Webb make breakfast, send their children off to school, and meet in their gardens to gossip. The two women also discuss their modest ambitions, and Mrs. Gibbs reveals that she longs to visit Paris.
Throughout the play, the characters pantomime their activities and chores. When Howie makes his milk deliveries, for example, no horse appears onstage despite the fact that he frequently addresses his horse as “Bessie.” Howie does not actually hold anything in his hands, but he pantomimes carrying bottles of milk, and the sound of clinking milk bottles comes from offstage. This deliberate abandonment of props goes hand in hand with the minimal set.
	The Stage Manager interrupts the action. He calls Professor Willard and then Mr. Webb out onto the stage to tell the audience some basic facts about Grover’s Corners. Mr. Webb not only reports to the audience, but also takes questions from some “audience members” who are actually characters in the play seated in the audience.
Afternoon arrives, school lets out, and George Gibbs meets his neighbor Emily Webb outside the gate of her house. We see the first inkling of George and Emily’s romantic affection for one another during this scene and during Emily’s subsequent conversation with her mother. The Stage Manager thanks and dismisses Emily and Mrs. Webb, then launches into a discussion of a time capsule that will be placed in the foundation of a new bank building in town. He tells us that he wishes to put a copy of Our Town into this time capsule.
	Now evening, a choir in the orchestra pit begins to sing “Blessed Be the Tie That Binds.” The choir, directed by the bitter yet comical choirmaster Simon Stimson, continues to sing as George and Emily talk to each other through their open windows. Mrs. Webb, Mrs. Gibbs, and their gossipy friend Mrs. Soames return home from choir practice and chat about the choirmaster’s alcoholism. The women return to their respective homes. George and his sister Rebecca sit at a window and look outside. Rebecca ponders the position of Grover’s Corners within the vastness of the universe, which she believes is contained within “the Mind of God.” Night has fallen on Grover’s Corners, and the first act comes to an end.
	Act II takes place three years later, on George and Emily’s wedding day. George tries to visit his fiancée, but he is shooed away by Mr. and Mrs. Webb, who insist that it is bad luck for the groom to see the bride-to-be on the wedding day anytime before the ceremony. Mrs. Webb goes upstairs to make sure Emily does not come downstairs. George is left alone with Mr. Webb. The young man and his future father-in-law awkwardly discuss marriage and how to be a virtuous husband.
	The Stage Manager interjects and introduces a flashback to the previous year. George and Emily are on their way home from school. George has just been elected class president and Emily has just been elected secretary and treasurer. George has also become something of a local baseball star. Emily tells George that his popularity has made him “conceited and stuck-up.” George, though hurt, thanks Emily for her honesty, but Emily becomes mortified by her own words and asks George to forget them. The two stop at Mr. Morgan’s drugstore for ice-cream sodas and, over the course of their drink, admit their mutual affection. George decides to scrap his plan of attending agriculture school in favor of staying in Grover’s Corners with Emily.
	We return to the day of the wedding in 1904. Both the bride and groom feel jittery, but their parents calm them down and the ceremony goes ahead as planned. The Stage Manager acts as the clergyman. The newlyweds run out through the audience, and the second act ends with the Stage Manager’s announcement that it is time for another intermission.
	Act III takes place nine years later, in a cemetery on a hilltop overlooking the town. Emily has died in childbirth and is about to be buried. The funeral party occupies the back of the stage. The most prominent characters in this act, the dead souls who already inhabit the cemetery, sit in chairs at the front of the stage. Among the dead are Mrs. Gibbs, Mrs. Soames, Wally Webb, and Simon Stimson. As the funeral takes place, the dead speak, serving as detached witnesses. Death has rendered them largely indifferent to earthly events. Emily joins the dead, but she misses her previous life and decides to go back and relive part of it. The other souls disapprove and advise Emily to stay in the cemetery.
	With the aid of the Stage Manager, Emily steps into the past, revisiting the morning of her twelfth birthday. Howie Newsome and Joe Crowell, Jr. make their deliveries as usual. Mrs. Webb gives her daughter some presents and calls to Mr. Webb. As Emily participates, she also watches the scene as an observer, noting her parents’ youth and beauty. Emily now has a nostalgic appreciation for everyday life that her parents and the other living characters do not share. She becomes agonized by the beauty and transience of everyday life and demands to be taken back to the cemetery. As Emily settles in among the dead souls, George lays prostrate by her tomb. “They don’t understand,” she says of the living. The stars come out over Grover’s Corners, and the play ends."
Clocks,"A Clockwork Orange takes place in a futuristic city governed by a repressive, totalitarian super-State. In this society, ordinary citizens have fallen into a passive stupor of complacency, blind to the insidious growth of a rampant, violent youth culture. The protagonist of the story is Alex, a fifteen-year-old boy who narrates in a teenage slang called nadsat, which incorporates elements of Russian and Cockney English. Alex leads a small gang of teenage criminals—Dim, Pete, and Georgie—through the streets, robbing and beating men and raping women. Alex and his friends spend the rest of their time at the Korova Milkbar, an establishment that serves milk laced with drugs, and a bar called the Duke of New York.
Alex begins his narrative from the Korova, where the boys sit around drinking. When Alex and his gang leave the bar, they go on a crime spree that involves mugging, robbery, a gang fight, auto theft, breaking and entering, and rape. The last of these crimes is particularly brutal. The boys travel to the countryside with their stolen car, break into a cottage and beat up the man inside before raping his wife while making him watch. They then head back to the Korova, where they fight with each other. Alex, who loves classical music, becomes angry at Dim when Dim mocks an opera that Alex likes. Alex punches Dim in the face, which prompts the others to turn against their arrogant leader. The next time they go out, they break into an old woman’s house. She calls the police, and before Alex can get away, Dim hits him in the eye with a chain and runs away with the others. The police apprehend Alex and take him to the station, where he later learns that the woman he beat and raped during the earlier robbery has died. 
Alex is sentenced to fourteen years in prison. At first, prison is difficult for him. The guards are merciless and oppressive, and several of the other prisoners want to rape him. After a few years, though, prison life becomes easier. He befriends the prison chaplain, who notices Alex’s interest in the Bible. The chaplain lets Alex read in the chapel while listening to classical music, and Alex pores over the Old Testament, delighting in the sex, drinking, and fighting he finds in its pages. 
One day, after fighting with and killing a cellmate, Alex is selected as the first candidate for an experimental treatment called Ludovico’s Technique, a form of brainwashing that incorporates associative learning. After being injected with a substance that makes him dreadfully sick, the doctors force Alex to watch exceedingly violent movies. In this way, Alex comes to associate violence with the nausea and headaches he experiences from the shot. The process takes two weeks to complete, after which the mere thought of violence has the power to make Alex ill. As an unintended consequence of the treatment, Alex can no longer enjoy classical music, which he has always associated with violence. This side effect doesn’t bother the State, which considers Alex’s successful treatment a victory for law and order and plans to implement it on a large scale.
After two years in prison, Alex is released, a harmless human being incapable of vicious acts. Soon, however, Alex finds he’s not only harmless but also defenseless, as his earlier victims begin to take revenge on him. His old friend Dim and an old enemy named Billyboy are both police officers now, and they take the opportunity to settle old scores. They drive him to a field in the country, beat him, and leave him in the rain. Looking for charity, Alex wanders to a nearby cottage and knocks on the door, begging for help. The man living there lets him in and gives him food and a room for the night. Alex recognizes him from two years ago as the man whose wife he raped, but the man does not recognize Alex, who wore a mask that night. Alex learns later in the night that the man’s wife died of shock shortly after being raped. 
This man, F. Alexander, is a political dissident. When he hears Alex’s story, he thinks he can use Alex to incite public outrage against the State. He and three of his colleagues develop a plan for Alex to make several public appearances. Alex, however, is tired of being exploited for other people’s schemes. He berates the men in nadsat, which arouses the suspicion of F. Alexander, who still remembers the strange language spoken by the teenagers who raped his wife. Based on F. Alexander’s suspicion, the men change their plans. They lock Alex in an apartment and blast classical music through the wall, hoping to drive Alex to suicide so they can blame the government. 
Alex does, in fact, hurl himself out of an attic window, but the fall doesn’t kill him. While he lies in the hospital, unconscious, a political struggle ensues, but the current administration survives. State doctors undo Ludovico’s Technique and restore Alex’s old vicious self in exchange for Alex’s endorsement. Back to normal, Alex assembles a new gang and engages in the same behavior as he did before prison, but he soon begins to tire of a life of violence. After running into his old friend Pete, who is now married and living a normal life, Alex decides that such a life is what he wants for himself. His final thoughts are of his future son."
Loyally,"The narrator, Le Ly, is the youngest of six children born to peasant farmers in Ka Ly, a town on the central coast of Vietnam. She has a close relationship with her parents, who teach her valuable lessons she carries through her life. From her father, Trong, she learns important Buddhist philosophies that help her make sense of the war; from her mother, Huyen, she learns the love and bonds of family.
Villagers of Ka Ly fight for both sides of the war. Le Ly’s own brothers are split between North and South, and many families change sides during the war. By day, the village is under the rule of the Republicans, and at night, under that of the Viet Cong. At first, the Viet Cong’s motives for war correspond more closely to the villagers own beliefs and values then those of the South, and consequently, the villagers, including Le Ly, help the Viet Cong. However, Le Ly soon learns the severity of the Viet Cong when she is raped and exiled from the village. Her mother joins her, and they leave to find work in Saigon, while her father remains there to tend to the land of their ancestors.
The bustling city of Saigon is overwhelming and intimidating to Le Ly and her mother. They eventually find employment from a wealthy businessman, Anh, and his family. Le Ly is a governess to his children and a personal maid to his sickly wife; Huyen is a second housekeeper. Le Ly falls in love with Anh and soon becomes pregnant with his child. When she discovers her pregnancy, Le Ly and her mother are thrown out of the house. She returns to Danang, homeless, unemployed, and pregnant. The pregnancy is hard for Le Ly because she lives with her sister Lan and Lan’s abusive American boyfriends. When he hears about his daughter’s unwed pregnancy, Trong disowns her, but after her son Huang’s birth, Trong forgives his beloved daughter. After the birth of her son, Le Ly supports her family by selling souvenirs on the black market. She also secretly visits and cares for her father, who remains in the village. In spite of Le Ly’s diligent care, Trong becomes inconsolably disillusioned with the war. He also grows depressed because he is separated from his family. He commits suicide by drinking acid.
Through her positive dealings with Americans—her relationship with her first husband, Ed, and her subsequent boyfriends—and negative experience with the Viet Cong, Le Ly’s opinion of “the enemy” changes. After her father’s death, Le Ly is no longer confused about where her loyalty should lie. She decides that she will leave Vietnam as soon as possible. Over the next few years, Le Ly works at a hospital and at GI bars. She has many American boyfriends: Red, a nerdy Navy medic who changes her appearance; Jimmy, a Chinese-American civilian contractor becomes a violent drunk; Paul, a U.S. Air Force officer; and Ed Monroe, an elderly civilian contractor. Ed, lonely for companionship, asks Le Ly to marry him. Taken with his kindness and the opportunity to leave Vietnam for the United States, Le Ly accepts. After months of preparation and the birth of her second son, Le Ly leaves her homeland, unsure if she will ever return.
In the 1980s, the Communist Party of Vietnam starts to allow Viet Ku—Vietnamese expatriates—to return to the country. Le Ly is anxious about returning and wary of how her family will receive her. When she arrives in Saigon, Anh greets her warmly. Together they travel to Danang for the reunion with her family. Le Ly realizes that she has returned to a country controlled by fear, more so than when she left. She also realizes that she may be putting her family in danger by returning.
Le Ly is most anxious about her reunion with her eldest brother, Bon Ngh, and her mother. Bon Ngh left for Hanoi when Le Ly was only five, so he is like a stranger to her. He is very suspicious of her motivations for returning and suspects that she is a spy. Over the next few days of her visit, Le Ly slowly convinces her brother that she has returned only to see her family and that she is eager to mend the wounds of the war. Huyen is also cold toward Le Ly at first but gradually warms up to her. During their time together, Huyen shares many stories with Le Ly and gladly accepts all of her gifts.
Le Ly speaks to her brother about setting up a medical center and improving the relationship between the government and the Viet Ku and the rest of the world. She exposes her family to the important lessons that she learned. From her teaching, Huyen mends the strained relationship with her daughter and reunites the whole family. After a tearful goodbye to her mother and sisters, Le Ly leaves Danang with a renewed desire to help her country. On the flight back to Saigon, she catches a glimmer of Ka Ly out the window."
Blot,"As a huntress and her family’s primary source of survival, nineteen-year-old Feyre stalks the bleak woods, a little farther from home than usual. Her family was once very wealthy, but they now live in poverty. Feyre’s luck turns when she spots a deer. At the same time, an enormous wolf appears out of nowhere. Feyre wonders if the wolf is a faerie in disguise. She hates faeries for all the harm they have done to humans. Feyre decides to use a precious ash arrow, a surefire method to kill a faerie, just in case. She fires the arrow as the wolf attacks the deer, killing the beast. The next evening, a golden beast bursts through the door of her family’s rundown cottage. The beast reveals that the wolf was indeed a faerie named Andras. The beast demands payment for his death under the terms of the Treaty between the human and faerie realms. The beast gives Feyre a choice: he can kill her now, or she can follow him to the faerie realm of Prythian to live out the rest of her days. Feyre chooses to live. 
In Prythian, Feyre learns the golden beast is a High Fae called Tamlin. He is the High Lord of the Spring Court. Tamlin and all the faeries in his court wear permanent masks on their faces due to an affliction called the blight. At first, Feyre is determined to escape Prythian, but she soon becomes accustomed to her new home. She learns about its history and magic and that much of what she was raised to believe about faeries, including their inability to lie and their aversion to iron, are myths. Feyre develops an affection for Alis, her lady-in-waiting, and Lucien, Tamlin’s best friend. Tamlin encourages her to explore her love for painting and to improve her reading skills. He reveals that he has ensured her family is well cared for in the human realm. Romantic and sexual tension grows between them. Although Feyre finds Prythian beautiful, it is full of dangerous creatures and intrigue. The blight makes life in Prythian increasingly perilous. After a threatening visit from a High Fae named Rhysand, Tamlin believes Feyre is no longer safe in Prythian and decides to send her back to the human realm. The night before she leaves, they make love. Tamlin tells Feyre that he loves her. Though she loves him too, she cannot bring herself to speak the words aloud.  
Feyre returns to the human realm to find that Tamlin was true to his word. Her family is extremely wealthy and well cared for. Her father and sisters have been glamoured, or tricked with faerie magic, and know nothing about faeries or how their wealth was restored. They believe Feyre has been away caring for a sick aunt. Soon, her sister Nesta reveals the glamour did not work on her. After Feyre was taken to Prythian, Nesta searched for her but was unable to cross the wall between the human and faerie realms. Nesta also reveals she is still angry at their father for not trying harder to save their mother’s life. Nesta’s words inspire Feyre to fight harder for Tamlin and she sets off for Prythian to fight the blight alongside him.  
When Feyre arrives at the Spring Court, Tamlin’s manor house is in shambles. Alis is the only one left. Alis reveals that the blight is a euphemism that refers to Amarantha, the High Queen of Prythian. Amarantha is an interloper who took Prythian over by force. She stole the powers of the High Fae and placed a curse on Tamlin that could only be broken by a woman who hated the fae declaring her love for him. Since Feyre never told Tamlin she loved him, the curse remained. The curse prevented the faeries from telling Feyre the truth, so they used the blight to explain their masks and other conflicts. Alis can tell Feyre this because Amarantha has relaxed part of the curse, believing she’s already won, but there is still one aspect of the curse Alis cannot reveal. When Alis explains that Tamlin and Lucien are Amarantha’s captives, Feyre decides to go after them. 
Feyre journeys to Amarantha’s faerie court Under the Mountain, where she becomes a captive as well. Amarantha gives her the chance to save Tamlin by completing three tasks or by solving a riddle. For the first task, Feyre uses her hunting skills to escape a giant worm in a labyrinth. As the faeries place bets and watch in amusement, the only one to bet on Feyre is Rhysand. After, he heals her broken arm. In exchange, Feyre agrees to spend a week every month with him in the Night Court. For the second task, Feyre must successfully solve a puzzle and choose the right lever or she and Lucien will be impaled and crushed. She makes the correct choice with the aid of Rhysand’s voice in her head. In the meantime, Rhysand parades Feyre around as his escort at parties. 
For the third task, Feyre must stab three faeries in the heart with ash wood daggers. Despite her guilt, she knows it’s the only way to break the curse. She stabs the first two faeries, but when the hood is removed from the third one, it is Tamlin. At first, Feyre believes she must kill the man she loves until she remembers two conversations about Tamlin’s heart of stone. She believes this means Tamlin’s heart is literally made of stone so he cannot be harmed by the dagger. Knowing Amarantha wants Tamlin for herself and doesn’t want to see him killed, Feyre plunges the dagger into Tamlin’s chest. She is correct, but Amarantha refuses to break the curse based on a technicality. In a rage, Amarantha beats Feyre almost to death. Feyre finally realizes the answer to Amarantha’s riddle is the word love. She speaks the solution aloud and the curse breaks just as Feyre dies. With the curse broken, Tamlin and Rhysand join forces to destroy Amarantha. One by one, the six High Lords gift Feyre with healing light and immortality. Tamlin sets a bit of this golden light on her heart, resurrecting Feyre and transforming her into one of the High Fae. Feyre and Tamlin are finally free, but Feyre must reckon with her new life and the lives she took to bring them to this point."
Esteem,"Marianne Sheridan and Connell Waldron attend secondary school in a small town in Ireland and will soon be going off to college. They are smart, like to read, are interested in world events, and care about social justice. Marianne lives with her brother and her widowed mother. They are a wealthy family, but her brother, Alan, is verbally and physically abusive toward Marianne, and her mother, instead of intervening, takes Alan’s side. Marianne has low self-esteem from years of internalizing her brother’s verbal abuse. 
Connell’s mother, Lorraine, works as a cleaner. She dropped out of school when she became pregnant with Connell and never told anyone who the father was. Lorraine cleans the Sheridans’ house twice weekly. Since she doesn’t drive, Lorraine needs Connell to pick her up when she is done, so Connell and Marianne see each other often. Connell is self-conscious about his origins, naturally shy, inarticulate in conversations, and indecisive.
At school, Marianne is deliberately antisocial and is considered a misfit, whereas Connell is handsome and athletic, and is therefore popular despite his private insecurities. Publicly, Marianne ignores Connell to avoid harming his social standing, but privately she tells Connell bluntly that she has feelings for him. Cornell has feelings for Marianne, too, but he thinks of their relationship as a private matter and not to be shared with the rest of the world. His feelings are partly based partly on wanting to protect his social status, but also he connects with Marianne in a way he does not connect with anyone else and does not fully understand. 
Lorraine is aware that Marianne and Connell are growing close and approves since she likes Marianne a great deal. After Marianne and Connell begin a sexual relationship, over time Connell becomes more willing to be seen with Marianne in public. The relationship ends abruptly, however, when Connell asks one of the school’s most popular girls, not Marianne, to the dance for graduating seniors. Lorraine is furious at Connell, and Marianne is so humiliated that she stops attending school. Connell is ashamed and wants to apologize to Marianne, but she ignores his calls and texts.
Connell and Marianne meet again while attending university in Dublin, when her current boyfriend, a political right-winger named Gareth, invites Connell to a party. Marianne and Connell reconnect and resume their relationship. However, whereas she is comfortable in the upper-class university environment and has become much more sociable than she was in school, Connell continually feels out of place at university. Connell’s sense of social inferiority leads to a second breakup with Marianne after a few months. Connell goes on to have a relationship with another student, Helen, who is more conventional than Marianne and condescends toward him. When Connell and Marianne both win a coveted scholarship, both his social standing and his financial situation improve. However, he still feels restless and unhappy at university.
Marianne has other relationships as well. She was a virgin before being with Connell, but during a relationship with Jamie, who is from a family even wealthier than her own, Marianne discovers that she wants to be dominated and physically abused during sex. When Marianne shares this fact with Connell, she assures him that her behavior with her boyfriend is an act. For Connell, she says, she really would do anything. Marianne continues to suffer abuse at the hands of her brother and mother when she is home for visits. She breaks up with Jamie after he behaves badly in front of others during a European trip. Connell comforts her, but she does not get back together with Connell. During a study year in Sweden, Marianne has another sado-masochistic relationship, this time with a photographer named Lukas. However, when Lukas mentions love, Marianne ends their relationship abruptly.
Throughout their relationship, violence repeatedly impacts Marianne and Connell in unexpected ways. Marianne’s relationship with Jamie suffers strain and Marianne and Connell are drawn closer together when Connell is mugged and Marianne tenderly sees to his injuries in front of Jamie and other friends.

Amongst,"Two migrant workers, George and Lennie, have been let off a bus miles away from the California farm where they are due to start work. George is a small, dark man with “sharp, strong features.” Lennie, his companion, is his opposite, a giant of a man with a “shapeless” face. Overcome with thirst, the two stop in a clearing by a pool and decide to camp for the night. As the two converse, it becomes clear that Lennie has an intellectual disability, and is deeply devoted to George and dependent upon him for protection and guidance. George finds that Lennie, who loves petting soft things but often accidentally kills them, has been carrying and stroking a dead mouse. George angrily throws it away, fearing that Lennie might catch a disease from the dead animal. George complains loudly that his life would be easier without having to care for Lennie, but the reader senses that their friendship and devotion is mutual. He and Lennie share a dream of buying their own piece of land, farming it, and, much to Lennie’s delight, keeping rabbits. George ends the night by treating Lennie to the story he often tells him about what life will be like in such an idyllic place.
The next day, the men report to the nearby ranch. George, fearing how the boss will react to Lennie, insists that he’ll do all the talking. He lies, explaining that they travel together because they are cousins and that a horse kicked Lennie in the head when he was a child. They are hired. They meet Candy, an old “swamper,” or handyman, with a missing hand and an ancient dog, and Curley, the boss’s mean-spirited son. Curley is newly married, possessive of his flirtatious wife, and full of jealous suspicion. Once George and Lennie are alone in the bunkhouse, Curley’s wife appears and flirts with them. Lennie thinks she is “purty,” but George, sensing the trouble that could come from tangling with this woman and her husband, warns Lennie to stay away from her. Soon, the ranch-hands return from the fields for lunch, and George and Lennie meet Slim, the skilled mule driver who wields great authority on the ranch. Slim comments on the rarity of friendship like that between George and Lennie. Carlson, another ranch-hand, suggests that since Slim’s dog has just given birth, they should offer a puppy to Candy and shoot Candy’s old, good-for-nothing dog.
The next day, George confides in Slim that he and Lennie are not cousins, but have been friends since childhood. He tells how Lennie has often gotten them into trouble. For instance, they were forced to flee their last job because Lennie tried to touch a woman’s dress and was accused of rape. Slim agrees to give Lennie one of his puppies, and Carlson continues to badger Candy to kill his old dog. When Slim agrees with Carlson, saying that death would be a welcome relief to the suffering animal, Candy gives in. Carlson, before leading the dog outside, promises to do the job painlessly.
Slim goes to the barn to do some work, and Curley, who is maniacally searching for his wife, heads to the barn to accost Slim. Candy overhears George and Lennie discussing their plans to buy land, and offers his life’s savings if they will let him live there too. The three make a pact to let no one else know of their plan. Slim returns to the bunkhouse, berating Curley for his suspicions. Curley, searching for an easy target for his anger, finds Lennie and picks a fight with him. Lennie crushes Curley’s hand in the altercation. Slim warns Curley that if he tries to get George and Lennie fired, he will be the laughingstock of the farm.
The next night, most of the men go to the local brothel. Lennie is left with Crooks, the lonely, Black stable-hand, and Candy. Curley’s wife flirts with them, refusing to leave until the other men come home. She notices the cuts on Lennie’s face and suspects that he, and not a piece of machinery as Curley claimed, is responsible for hurting her husband. This thought amuses her. The next day, Lennie accidentally kills his puppy in the barn. Curley’s wife enters and consoles him. She admits that life with Curley is a disappointment, and wishes that she had followed her dream of becoming a movie star. Lennie tells her that he loves petting soft things, and she offers to let him feel her hair. When he grabs too tightly, she cries out. In his attempt to silence her, he accidentally breaks her neck.
Lennie flees back to a pool of the Salinas River that George had designated as a meeting place should either of them get into trouble. As the men back at the ranch discover what has happened and gather together a lynch party, George joins Lennie. Much to Lennie’s surprise, George is not mad at him for doing “a bad thing.” George begins to tell Lennie the story of the farm they will have together. As he describes the rabbits that Lennie will tend, the sound of the approaching lynch party grows louder. George shoots his friend in the back of the head.
When the other men arrive, George lets them believe that Lennie had the gun, and George wrestled it away from him and shot him. Only Slim understands what has really happened, that George has killed his friend out of mercy. Slim consolingly leads him away, and the other men, completely puzzled, watch them leave."
Entitled,"Winesburg, Ohio begins with a sort of prologue, in which an old writer imagines all the people he has known as ""grotesques,"" warped in their pursuits of various truths. A series of stories ensues, each concerned with a single resident of Winesburg. The first, entitled ""Hands,"" describes Wing Biddlebaum, a recluse with remarkable hands that he cannot control, who has fled from false accusations of molesting a boy in another town. The second, ""Paper Pills,"" is about Doctor Reefy, an aging medical man who marries one of his young patients, only to have her die six months later. In the third, ""Mother,"" we meet Elizabeth Willard, the mother of the book's central character, George Willard, who is a young reporter for the local paper. Elizabeth is a sick woman, trapped in an unhappy marriage, and she imagines herself locked in a struggle with her husband for influence over George.
In the next story, ""The Philosopher,"" the eccentric Doctor Parcival imagines that a lynch mob is after him, and tells George Willard the secret of life: ""Everyone in the world is Christ and they are all crucified."" In ""Nobody Knows,"" George goes out into the fields and sleeps with a girl named Louise Trunnion, only to feel guilty about it afterward. The next four stories, all lumped under the heading ""Godliness,"" depict Jesse Bentley, a wealthy farmer who imagines himself a Biblical figure chosen by God. His daughter, Louise Bentley, receives no love from him, and stumbles into a loveless marriage. Her son, David Hardy, is sent to live with his grandfather on the old man's farm, and Jesse takes the boy out into the forest in search of a message from God. He finds no message, however, and succeeds only in traumatizing the boy so much that David runs away from Winesburg forever.
In ""A Man of Ideas,"" the next story, a talkative man named Joe Welling successfully courts a woman whose father and brother are notorious thugs. The following story, ""Adventure,"" depicts the loneliness of Alice Hindman, an unmarried woman whose true love (as she considers him) left Winesburg years ago and has never returned. ""Respectability"" portrays Wash Williams, the filthy, ugly telegraph operator in Winesburg who despises women because of his wife's infidelity and his mother-in-law's treachery. ""The Thinker,"" tells the story of a brooding young man named Seth Richmond who feels that he does not belong in Winesburg. At the end of a long evening with Helen White, the daughter of the Winesburg banker, he tells her that he plans to leave town for good.
""Tandy"" tells the story of a little girl named Tandy Hard whose first name comes from a drunken man's description of the perfect woman. In ""The Strength of God,"" a minister named Curtis Hartman is tempted into lust by the sight of Kate Swift, a local schoolteacher. His temptation passes when he sees her, one snowy night, praying naked. ""The Teacher"" takes place on the same night, and depicts Kate Smith's attraction to George Willard--her simultaneous desires to teach and embrace him--and her sudden guilty flight from his office, which leaves him confused. ""Loneliness"" details Enoch Robinson's move from Winesburg to New York, where he populates his apartment with imaginary friends, only to have them move out when he tries to tell his female neighbor about them.
In ""An Awakening,"" George Willard goes out walking one night and has what he thinks is an epiphany. He tries to tell Belle Carpenter, the girl he has been seeing, about it, but another one of her suitors beats him up, and the magic of the evening slips away. ""Queer"" depicts the resentment that Elmer Cowley, the son of a store owner, feels toward Winesburg and George Willard because he thinks that the town considers his family to be odd. The story ends with Elmer beating up George and hopping a train out of town. In ""The Untold Lie,"" a farmhand named Hal Winters asks another farmhand named Ray Pearson for advice about whether to get married, causing Ray to reflect on his marriage, which he does with disgust. ""Drink"" portrays a genial, happy young man named Tom Foster and his first experience with drunkenness.
In ""Death,"" Elizabeth Willard and Doctor Reefy spend time together and begin to fall in love, as she slips toward death. She dies, finally, and George decides to quit Winesburg forever. In ""Sophistication,"" he and Helen White go out walking together on the night of the county fair, and run around like children as evening falls on Winesburg. Both are moving on from their small town, as Helen is going to college, and in the final story, ""Departure,"" George Willard boards a train and leaves Winesburg for good, letting his life there ""become but a background on which to paint the dreams of his manhood."""
Destroys,"Ishmael, the narrator, announces his intent to ship aboard a whaling vessel. He has made several voyages as a sailor but none as a whaler. He travels to New Bedford, Massachusetts, where he stays in a whalers’ inn. Since the inn is rather full, he has to share a bed with a harpooner from the South Pacific named Queequeg. At first repulsed by Queequeg’s strange habits and shocking appearance (Queequeg is covered with tattoos), Ishmael eventually comes to appreciate the man’s generosity and kind spirit, and the two decide to seek work on a whaling vessel together. They take a ferry to Nantucket, the traditional capital of the whaling industry. There they secure berths on the Pequod, a savage-looking ship adorned with the bones and teeth of sperm whales. Peleg and Bildad, the Pequod’s Quaker owners, drive a hard bargain in terms of salary. They also mention the ship’s mysterious captain, Ahab, who is still recovering from losing his leg in an encounter with a sperm whale on his last voyage.
The Pequod leaves Nantucket on a cold Christmas Day with a crew made up of men from many different countries and races. Soon the ship is in warmer waters, and Ahab makes his first appearance on deck, balancing gingerly on his false leg, which is made from a sperm whale’s jaw. He announces his desire to pursue and kill Moby Dick, the legendary great white whale who took his leg, because he sees this whale as the embodiment of evil. Ahab nails a gold doubloon to the mast and declares that it will be the prize for the first man to sight the whale. As the Pequod sails toward the southern tip of Africa, whales are sighted and unsuccessfully hunted. During the hunt, a group of men, none of whom anyone on the ship’s crew has seen before on the voyage, emerges from the hold. The men’s leader is an exotic-looking man named Fedallah. These men constitute Ahab’s private harpoon crew, smuggled aboard in defiance of Bildad and Peleg. Ahab hopes that their skills and Fedallah’s prophetic abilities will help him in his hunt for Moby Dick.
The Pequod rounds Africa and enters the Indian Ocean. A few whales are successfully caught and processed for their oil. From time to time, the ship encounters other whaling vessels. Ahab always demands information about Moby Dick from their captains. One of the ships, the Jeroboam, carries Gabriel, a crazed prophet who predicts doom for anyone who threatens Moby Dick. His predictions seem to carry some weight, as those aboard his ship who have hunted the whale have met disaster. While trying to drain the oil from the head of a captured sperm whale, Tashtego, one of the Pequod’s harpooners, falls into the whale’s voluminous head, which then rips free of the ship and begins to sink. Queequeg saves Tashtego by diving into the ocean and cutting into the slowly sinking head.
During another whale hunt, Pip, the Pequod’s black cabin boy, jumps from a whaleboat and is left behind in the middle of the ocean. He goes insane as the result of the experience and becomes a crazy but prophetic jester for the ship. Soon after, the Pequod meets the Samuel Enderby, a whaling ship whose skipper, Captain Boomer, has lost an arm in an encounter with Moby Dick. The two captains discuss the whale; Boomer, happy simply to have survived his encounter, cannot understand Ahab’s lust for vengeance. Not long after, Queequeg falls ill and has the ship’s carpenter make him a coffin in anticipation of his death. He recovers, however, and the coffin eventually becomes the Pequod’s replacement life buoy.
Ahab orders a harpoon forged in the expectation that he will soon encounter Moby Dick. He baptizes the harpoon with the blood of the Pequod’s three harpooners. The Pequod kills several more whales. Issuing a prophecy about Ahab’s death, Fedallah declares that Ahab will first see two hearses, the second of which will be made only from American wood, and that he will be killed by hemp rope. Ahab interprets these words to mean that he will not die at sea, where there are no hearses and no hangings. A typhoon hits the Pequod, illuminating it with electrical fire. Ahab takes this occurrence as a sign of imminent confrontation and success, but Starbuck, the ship’s first mate, takes it as a bad omen and considers killing Ahab to end the mad quest. After the storm ends, one of the sailors falls from the ship’s masthead and drowns—a grim foreshadowing of what lies ahead.
Ahab’s fervent desire to find and destroy Moby Dick continues to intensify, and the mad Pip is now his constant companion. The Pequod approaches the equator, where Ahab expects to find the great whale. The ship encounters two more whaling ships, the Rachel and the Delight, both of which have recently had fatal encounters with the whale. Ahab finally sights Moby Dick. The harpoon boats are launched, and Moby Dick attacks Ahab’s harpoon boat, destroying it. The next day, Moby Dick is sighted again, and the boats are lowered once more. The whale is harpooned, but Moby Dick again attacks Ahab’s boat. Fedallah, trapped in the harpoon line, is dragged overboard to his death. Starbuck must maneuver the Pequod between Ahab and the angry whale.
On the third day, the boats are once again sent after Moby Dick, who once again attacks them. The men can see Fedallah’s corpse lashed to the whale by the harpoon line. Moby Dick rams the Pequod and sinks it. Ahab is then caught in a harpoon line and hurled out of his harpoon boat to his death. All of the remaining whaleboats and men are caught in the vortex created by the sinking Pequod and pulled under to their deaths. Ishmael, who was thrown from a boat at the beginning of the chase, was far enough away to escape the whirlpool, and he alone survives. He floats atop Queequeg’s coffin, which popped back up from the wreck, until he is picked up by the Rachel, which is still searching for the crewmen lost in her earlier encounter with Moby Dick."
Harbor,"Refugee follows the stories of three different children and their families, each attempting to flee their violent homelands, in different regions of the world and during different decades. Josef and his family flee Nazi Germany in 1938; Isabel and her family flee Cuba in 1994; and Mahmoud and his family flee Syria in 2015.
Josef Landau is a twelve-year-old boy living in Berlin. In 1938, his home is raided by Nazi storm troopers, and his father is taken to the Dachau concentration camp. Six months later, his mother receives a telegram that her husband has been released, but the family must leave Germany immediately. Josef, his sister Ruth, and his mother all travel to Hamburg to board a ship that will take them to Cuba. When Josef’s father is reunited with his family, they notice that Dachau has changed him: he is paranoid and very thin. They board the St. Louis, a large German ship, and set out.
Aboard the St. Louis, Josef’s family and the other passengers, all Jewish refugees, are treated well by Captain Schroeder and most of the ship’s crew. A few of the crew, however, openly dislike the Jewish passengers, especially Otto Schiendick, who proudly states his Nazi allegiance. When the St. Louis reaches Havana Harbor in Cuba, the ship is not allowed to dock. Josef’s father’s mental state deteriorates further, and he eventually jumps from the ship, trying to kill himself. Officer Padron, a Cuban policeman assigned to the St. Louis, saves Josef’s father. Josef’s father is taken to Havana to recover. When Officer Padron returns to the St. Louis, he is treated like a hero by the Jewish passengers. 
Eventually, the captain announces that they are not going to be allowed to dock in Havana and that the boat will be leaving. He promises the passengers that he will try to deliver them to a country other than Germany. The refugees aboard the St. Louis are delivered to England, Belgium, the Netherlands, and France. The Nazis invade France just a few months after Josef’s family arrives there. When the family is eventually caught, Josef’s mother is forced to choose which of her children will be freed and which will be sent to a concentration camp.
Isabel Fernandez is an eleven-year-old girl who lives just outside Havana in 1994. After the fall of the Soviet Union, Cuba has become inhospitable for most of its citizens under the regime of Fidel Castro. Isabel’s best friend and neighbor, Iván, is building a small boat with his father so that his family can flee to America. After a riot in Havana, Isabel’s family decides that they should also leave Cuba immediately. Isabel trades her trumpet to a fisherman for gasoline, paying her family’s way onto Iván’s family’s boat. Lito, Isabel’s grandfather, also joins them. 
The two families face many challenges as they try to cross the Caribbean Sea to Florida. A storm sweeps them to the Bahamas, where they are not allowed to disembark; Iván is attacked by sharks and eventually bleeds to death in the boat; and toward the end of the journey, Isabel’s pregnant mother goes into labor. Lito tells the story of the St. Louis and how he had to turn away so many refugees when he was a young policeman. (He is Officer Padron from Josef’s story.) Just when Miami becomes visible on the horizon, a U.S. Coast Guard boat tries to intercept the two families. Lito jumps in the water to distract the Coast Guard, and Isabel’s mother gives birth to a boy, just as they reach the shore. When Isabel is asked to play a song at her new school in America, she plays a Cuban salsa version of “The Star-Spangled Banner.”
Mahmoud Bishara is a twelve-year-old boy who lives in Aleppo, Syria in 2015. For the last few years, there has been a war in his country between the Syrian government, rebels, the Soviets, the United States and several other factions. After Mahmoud’s home is destroyed, his brother Waleed, sister Hana, and his parents drive to the border of Turkey, hoping to escape. Mahmoud’s father tells them that Germany is accepting Syrian refugees and if they can get to Greece, they will be able to travel within the European Union to reach Germany. After a violent conflict between the rebels and the Syrian government, Mahmoud and his family walk to the Turkish border. Mahmoud’s father arranges for a smuggler to take them to the island of Lesbos, in Greece. The smuggler’s raft is destroyed by rocks as they cross the Mediterranean. Mahmoud hands his sister, Hana, to another passing raft of refugees, knowing that his mother cannot hold her and swim. The family is eventually pulled from the water by the Greek Coast Guard. 
Mahmoud and his family travel through Serbia and into Hungary, where they are detained at a refugee camp that is built like a prison. Mahmoud decides that he no longer wants to be ignored and leads the refugees out of the prison, walking twelve hours to Austria. The refugees are welcomed in Austria, and Mahmoud’s family takes a train to Germany. While they travel, they ask if anyone has seen Hana. After a few weeks in Munich, Mahmoud’s family is transferred to a host family in Berlin. An elderly couple, Herr and Frau Rosenberg, welcome them into their home. Frau Rosenberg takes Mahmoud aside and tells him the story of her childhood: she is Ruth, Josef’s sister. The night that they were captured in France, Josef volunteered to be taken by the Nazis; both Josef and their mother were killed in concentration camps. Ruth promises to help Mahmoud find Hana."
Freed,"Frederick Douglass was born into slavery sometime in 1817 or 1818. Like many enslaved people, he is unsure of his exact date of birth. Douglass is separated from his mother, Harriet Bailey, soon after he is born. His father is most likely their white master, Captain Anthony. Captain Anthony is the clerk of a rich man named Colonel Lloyd. Lloyd enslaves hundreds of men, women, and children, who call his large, central plantation the “Great House Farm.” Life on any of Lloyd’s plantations, like that on many Southern plantations, is brutal. Those enslaved are overworked and exhausted, receive little food, few articles of clothing, and no beds. Those who break rules—and even those who do not—are beaten or whipped, and sometimes even shot by the plantation overseers, the cruelest of which are Mr. Severe and Mr. Austin Gore. 
Douglass’s life on this plantation is not as hard as that of most of the others. Being a child, he serves in the household instead of in the fields. At the age of seven, he is given to Captain Anthony’s son‑in‑law’s brother, Hugh Auld, who lives in Baltimore. In Baltimore, Douglass enjoys a relatively freer life. In general, city slave-owners are more conscious of appearing cruel or neglectful toward those they enslave in front of their non‑slaveowning neighbors.
Sophia Auld, Hugh’s wife, has never ""owned"" enslaved people before, and therefore she is surprisingly kind to Douglass at first. She even begins to teach Douglass to read, until her husband orders her to stop, saying that education makes enslaved people unmanageable. Eventually, Sophia succumbs to the mentality of slaveowning and loses her natural kindliness. Though Sophia and Hugh Auld become crueler toward him, Douglass still likes Baltimore and is able to teach himself to read with the help of local boys. As he learns to read and write, Douglass becomes conscious of the evils of slavery and of the existence of the abolitionist, or antislavery, movement. He resolves to escape to the North eventually.
After the deaths of Captain Anthony and his remaining heirs, Douglass is taken back to serve Thomas Auld, Captain Anthony’s son‑in‑law. Auld is a mean man made harsher by his false religious piety. Auld considers Douglass unmanageable, so Auld rents him for one year to Edward Covey, a man known for “breaking” enslaved people. Covey manages, in the first six months, to work and whip all the spirit out of Douglass. Douglass becomes a brutish man, no longer interested in reading or freedom, capable only of resting from his injuries and exhaustion. The turning point comes when Douglass resolves to fight back against Covey. The two men have a two‑hour fight, after which Covey never touches Douglass again.
His year with Covey over, Douglass is next rented to William Freeland for two years. Though Freeland is a milder, fairer man, Douglass’s will to escape is nonetheless renewed. At Freeland’s, Douglass begins educating his fellow enslaved people in a Sabbath school at the homes of free Black people. Despite the threat of punishment and violence they face, many enslaved people from neighboring farms come to Douglass and work diligently to learn. At Freeland’s, Douglass also forms a plan of escape with three fellow enslaved men with whom he is close. Someone betrays their plan to Freeland, however, and Douglass and the others are taken to jail. Thomas Auld then sends Douglass back to Baltimore with Hugh Auld, to learn the trade of ship caulking.
In Baltimore’s trade industry, Douglass runs up against strained race relations. White workers have been working alongside free Black workers, but the whites have begun to fear that the increasing numbers of free Black people will take their jobs. Though only an apprentice and still enslaved, Douglass encounters violent tactics of intimidation from his white coworkers and is forced to switch shipyards. In his new apprenticeship, Douglass quickly learns the trade of caulking and soon earns the highest wages possible, always turning them over to Hugh Auld.
Eventually, Douglass receives permission from Hugh Auld to hire out his extra time. He saves money bit by bit and eventually makes his escape to New York. Douglass refrains from describing the details of his escape in order to protect the safety of future slaves who may attempt the journey. In New York, Douglass fears recapture and changes his name from Bailey to Douglass. Soon after, he marries Anna Murray, a free woman he met while in Baltimore. They move north to Massachusetts, where Douglass becomes deeply engaged with the abolitionist movement as both a writer and an orator."
Grown,"Billy lives on a farm. He wants two good coonhounds very badly, but his Papa cannot afford any. Billy works hard, selling fruit and bait to fishermen, so eventually he has enough money for the dogs. He gives the money to his grandfather, who orders the dogs for him. Billy sneaks off in the middle of the night to go to town and pick them up. While in town, other children pick on him, but he stands up for himself and is helped by the marshal. On his way home, he and his two pups sleep in a cave. Outside, they hear a mountain lion, and the pups bravely howl back. He decides to name them Old Dan and Little Ann. He can see that Old Dan is very brave, and that Little Ann is very smart.
Once home, he wants to begin training them. He has to have a raccoon hide to train them with. His grandfather shows him a way to set a trap that will catch even a clever coon. Just when he is about to give up on the traps, he catches a coon. The next day he begins to train Old Dan and Little Ann. By the time raccoon season starts in the fall, they are ready. On the first night, his dogs tree a coon in the biggest tree imaginable. Billy immediately sees that it will take days to cut down. He is determined to cut it down, because he told his dogs that if they could tree a coon he would take care of the rest. His dogs are counting on him. His parents bring him food. His grandfather shows him how to make a scarecrow, to keep the coon in the tree so he can go home and eat dinner. When the big sycamore finally falls and his dogs catch the coon, he is very proud.
Billy goes coon hunting almost every night. His father relieves him of his chores, and Billy gives him the money from his coonskins. Sometimes, coons try to trick his dogs, and Old Dan gets into trouble. One night, Dan gets stuck in a muskrat hole. Another night, he climbs a tree. Little Ann is usually too smart to get into trouble, but one night, after the first snowfall, she falls through the ice on the river. Billy barely rescues her.
One day, Billy and his grandfather make a bet with Ruben and Rainie Pritchard, that Billy's hounds can catch the legendary ""ghost coon."" The Pritchard boys set out with Billy to see if Old Dan and Little Ann can catch the ghost coon. The coon leads the dogs on a long, complicated chase, and the Pritchard boys want to give up. But Billy is determined. Finally, when the dogs have the coon treed, Billy refuses to kill her. Just as Ruben starts to beat up Billy, Old Dan and Little Ann begin to attack the Pritchards' dog. Ruben runs to attack the dogs with an axe, but falls and kills himself. Billy is very distraught afterward. Finally he goes to Ruben's grave with some flowers, then feels much better.
Billy's grandfather enters Billy in a coon-hunting contest. He, his grandfather, and his father take a buggy to the contest. It is filled with adult coon hunters with expensive gear and beautiful hounds. Somehow, Little Ann wins the beauty contest on the first day. The other coon hunters are very kind to Billy. Billy and his dogs qualify for the championship round. While Billy, his papa, his grandfather, and a judge are out hunting with coons, a winter blizzard begins. They lose track of the dogs, and Billy's grandfather falls and badly sprains his ankle. They stop and build a fire as day begins to break. Soon enough, they find the dogs, covered with ice. They have gotten just enough coons to win. Everyone at the tournament cheers. Billy has also won a jackpot of 300 dollars.
Billy's mama and sisters are overjoyed. Billy keeps up his hunting. One night, however, his dogs tree a mountain lion. Old Dan howls defiantly, and the big cat attacks. Billy is horrified, and with his axe he enters the fray, hoping to save his dogs, but they end up having to save him. Eventually, the dogs defeat the mountain lion, but Old Dan is badly wounded. He dies the next day. Billy is heartbroken, but Little Ann is so sad that she loses her will to live, and dies a few days later. Billy's papa tries to tell him that it is all for the best, because with the money Billy has earned, the family hopes to move to town. Billy does not completely recover until on the day of the move; he goes to visit the dogs' graves and finds a giant red fern. According to Indian legend, only an angel can plant a red fern. Billy and his family look at the fern in awe, and he feels ready to leave for the town."
Exploit,"In a brief preface, C.S. Lewis says he discovered the bundle of Screwtape’s letters somewhere, but will not say how he managed to come across them. Screwtape is a devil, he warns the reader, and Screwtape’s version of events, therefore, should not be taken as the truth. Then the letters begin. In them, Screwtape advises his nephew, Wormwood, on how best to tempt a British man, called only “the Patient,” into sin and, eventually, into Hell. Wormwood is an inexperienced devil, and he hasgone to a training college to help prepare him to tempt humans into sin. Screwtape complains, however, that this college has taught Wormwood nothing because of its incompetent director, Slubgob. By the second letter, readers learn that the Patient has converted to Christianity and has begun going to church. The Patient is most likely in his mid-thirties and he lives with and takes care of his aging mother.
The Patient’s mother is a difficult woman. She makes many demands on the Patient’s time and energy. In the early letters, Screwtape advises Wormwood to make the Patient think that being Christian is an internal, spiritual thing rather than an external way of being in the world. After the Patient prays, Wormwood should make him fight with his mother about insignificant details about the house and chores. Over the course of these early letters, the dynamic between Screwtape and Wormwood begins to take shape. Wormwood keeps himself invisible as he follows the Patient around on Earth.  He essentially whispers in the Patient’s ear, encouraging the Patient to experience negative emotions and to pursue unhealthy distractions. Unlike Wormwood, Screwtape is an experienced tempter. He has already won souls for Hell. This has earned him, it seems, a mid-management position in Hell’s vast “Lowerarchy”—a devilish corporation that determines how best to organize Hell’s temptation strategies on Earth.
After World War II begins, the Patient worries about whether he will be drafted. Screwtape advises Wormwood to exploit the Patient’s uncertainty, and soon, there is a period of relative inactivity during the war. During this time, Patient makes new, unnamed friends. These friends, however, are not Christians. They are skeptical and worldly. Screwtape advises Wormwood to make the Patient a hypocrite. The Patient should think he is better than his fellow, humble churchgoers because he has such smart and sophisticated friends, and he should think he is better than his friends because he, unlike them, is a Christian. As a result of the negative influence of these friends on the Patient, Wormwood, very briefly, seems to be doing a good job winning over the Patient’s soul. Soon, however, after reading a book and going on a walk by an old mill, the Patient experiences a reawakening of his faith. This reawakening amounts to a second conversion, and, during it, the Enemy—God—forms a barrier of grace around the Patient that appears to Wormwood as a noxious fog.
After the Patient’s second conversion, Screwtape advises Wormwood to tempt the Patient with sexual pleasures. Screwtape instructs Wormwood to make a list of all the young women in the Patient’s neighborhood that would prove to be bad marriages matches for the Patient. But the Patient falls in love withthe Woman. A Christian girl a Christian family, the Woman has a tremendously positive influence on the Patient’s life. Screwtape hates the Woman. During this time, Wormwood reports Screwtape to Hell’s secret police because Screwtape writes that the Enemy really loves humans. In Hell, this claim is heresy. It contradicts Hell’s essential teachingthat the Enemy’s love is a lie that the Enemy uses to mask His self-interest. Wormwood continues to make poor progress with the Patient and, during an episode of intense anger, Screwtape transforms into a giant centipede. This is a normal occurrence, he , an outward manifestation of his inner “Life Force.” is able to clear his name with Hell’s authorities by explaining that he was only speaking of the Enemy’s love for humans as an analogy for the Enemy’s incomprehensible preoccupation with humankind.
World War II, meanwhile, grows active again. The Germans begin to drop bombs on the Patient’s unnamed hometown. The Patient’s unspecified duties place him in harms way, and he soon begins to fear for his life. Screwtape advises Wormwood to exploit the Patient’s cowardice, but not to the extent that the Patient prays for help with it. During one bombing, the Patient acts according to his duty. Because he is afraid, however, the Patient feels himself to be a coward. This is bad news for Wormwood, Screwtape says. It keeps the Patient humble. Screwtape warns Wormwood that the Patient’s soul is prepared for Heaven, and he advises Wormwood to keep the Patient alive as long as possible. That way, Wormwood can use the Patient’s whole life to tempt him away from the Enemy and into sin. But the Patient dies during a German air raid, and his soul is taken into Heaven. Because of his failure, Wormwood must take the Patient’s place.  Wormwood begs Screwtape for mercy, but Screwtape laughs, saying there is no mercy in Hell. Screwtape concludes the final letter by saying how excited he is at the prospect of eating Wormwood alive."
Businesses,"The protagonist, who is named Tim O’Brien, begins by describing an event that occurred in the middle of his Vietnam experience. “The Things They Carried” catalogs the variety of things his fellow soldiers in the Alpha Company brought on their missions. Several of these things are intangible, including guilt and fear, while others are specific physical objects, including matches, morphine, M-16 rifles, and M&M’s candy.
Throughout the collection, the same characters reappear in various stories. The first member of the Alpha Company to die is Ted Lavender, a “grunt,” or low-ranking soldier, who deals with his anxiety about the war by taking tranquilizers and smoking marijuana. Lavender is shot in the head on his way back from going to the bathroom, and his superior, Lieutenant Jimmy Cross, blames himself for the tragedy. When Lavender is shot, Cross is distracting himself with thoughts of Martha, a college crush. It is revealed in “Love” that Cross’s feelings for Martha, whom he dated once before leaving for Vietnam, were never reciprocated, and that even twenty years after the war, his guilt over Lavender’s death remains.
In “On the Rainy River,” the narrator, O’Brien, explains the series of events that led him to Vietnam in the first place. He receives his draft notice in June of 1968, and his feelings of confusion drive him north to the Canadian border, which he contemplates crossing so that he will not be forced to fight in a war in which he doesn’t believe. Sitting in a rowboat with the proprietor of the Tip Top Lodge, where he stays, O’Brien decides that his guilt about avoiding the war and fear of disappointing his family are more important than his political convictions. He soon leaves, going first back home to Worthington, Minnesota and later to Vietnam.
In addition to Ted Lavender, a few other members of the Alpha Company are killed during their mission overseas, including Curt Lemon, who is killed when he steps on a rigged mortar round. Though O’Brien is not close to Lemon, in “The Dentist,” he tells a story of how Lemon, who faints before a routine checkup with an army-issued dentist, tries to save face by insisting that a perfectly good tooth be pulled. Lee Strunk, another member of the company, dies from injuries he sustains by stepping on a landmine. In “Friends,” O’Brien remembers that before Strunk was fatally hurt, Strunk and Dave Jensen had made a pact that if either man were irreparably harmed, the other man would see that he was quickly killed. However, when Strunk is actually hurt, he begs Jensen to spare him, and Jensen complies. Instead of being upset by the news of his friend’s swift death en route to treatment, Jensen is relieved.
The death that receives the most attention in The Things They Carried is that of Kiowa, a much-loved member of the Alpha Company and one of O’Brien’s closest friends. In “Speaking of Courage,” the story of Kiowa’s death is relayed in retrospect through the memory of Norman Bowker, years after the war. As Bowker drives around a lake in his Iowa hometown, he thinks that he failed to save Kiowa, who was killed when a mortar round hit and caused him to sink headfirst into a marshy field. O’Brien realizes that he has dealt with his guilt over Kiowa’s death differently than Norman Bowker in “Notes.” Just before the end of the war, O’Brien receives a long letter from Bowker that says he hasn’t found a way to make life meaningful after the war. O’Brien resolves to tell Bowker’s story, and the story of Kiowa’s death, in order to negotiate his own feelings of guilt and hollowness.
Like “Love” and “Notes,” several of O’Brien’s stories are told from a perspective twenty years after the Vietnam War, when he is a forty-three-year-old writer living in Massachusetts. Exposure to the guilt of old friends like Jimmy Cross and Norman Bowker prompts him to write stories in order to understand what they were going through. But two stories, “The Man I Killed” and “Ambush,” are written so that O’Brien can confront his own guilt over killing a man with a grenade outside the village of My Khe. In “The Man I Killed,” O’Brien imagines the life of his victim, from his childhood to the way things would have turned out for him had O’Brien not spotted him on a path and thrown a grenade at his feet. In “Ambush,” O’Brien imagines how he might relay the story of the man he killed to his nine-year-old daughter, Kathleen. In this second story, O’Brien provides more details of the actual killing—including the sound of the grenade and his own feelings—and explains that even well after the fact, he hasn’t finished sorting out the experience.
In the last story, “The Lives of the Dead,” O’Brien gives another twist to his contention that stories have the power to save people. In the stories of Curt Lemon and Kiowa, O’Brien explains that his imagination allowed him to grapple successfully with his guilt and confusion over the death of his fourth-grade first love, Linda."
Finished,"When the novel opens, Lily Bloom sits on the roof of a building in Boston, looking out at the city and the stars, thinking about death. She’s just come from her father’s funeral. She’s reflecting on how much she resents her father for abusing her mother when a man joins her on the roof and starts angrily kicking a patio chair. The man, Ryle Kincaid, is a neurosurgeon, and the two begin to flirt and tell each other increasingly intimate “naked truths.” Ryle reveals that he lost a child patient because the child’s brother shot him accidentally. Lily tells Ryle that she gave the eulogy at her abusive father’s funeral and couldn’t think of anything nice to say, so she stood there for two minutes in purposeful silence. Lily also tells Ryle she lost her virginity to a homeless boy named Atlas. Ryle tells Lily he wants to sleep with her, but he only has one-night stands and never wants to get married or have children. Though Lily is interested in Ryle, she can’t imagine having sex without it leading to a relationship. 
Six months later, Lily uses her inheritance to buy a storefront to convert into a flower shop. A woman named Allysa offers to work for Lily, and the two become fast friends. Lily and Allysa are cleaning up the storefront when Lily falls and hurts her ankle. Allysa calls her husband Marshall and her brother for help. When Allysa’s brother arrives, Lily sees that it’s Ryle. They pretend not to know each other for Allysa’s sake, but Ryle tells Lily that he still wants to sleep with her. They decide they need to stay away from each other because they want different things. As Lily recovers from her sprained ankle for a week, she reads her teenage journals, which were written as letters addressed to Ellen DeGeneres. They tell the story of Atlas and Lily. 
As a teenager, Lily notices a boy is living in an abandoned house behind hers. She feels for Atlas and begins to leave him food, lend him her father’s clothes, and let him shower at her house. The two become closer and begin to fall in love, and Atlas becomes a confidant and protector for Lily when her father hurts her and her mother. The two watch Ellen and Finding Nemo together and tell each other to “just keep swimming” when times get tough, quoting a line from the movie. Atlas learns a family member can take him in in Boston, and though Lily dreads it, Atlas moves away to find more stability. She’s heartbroken, but he returns on her 16th birthday. He gives her a magnet that says that everything is better in Boston. They make love for the first time. Atlas promises to come for Lily when he feels that his life is good enough for her. Then Lily’s father walks in on them. He savagely beats Atlas with a baseball bat. Atlas is taken away in an ambulance. This is the last time Lily sees Atlas, and throughout her life, she wonders why Atlas never came back for her.
Back in the present, Ryle pursues Lily, and after trying to get her to have sex with him, he admits he has feelings for her. Lily insists they not have sex and try dating, since she doesn’t trust him to have a relationship with her. They quickly start falling for each other. After they have been dating for a bit, Ryle invites himself to dinner with Lily and her mom. At dinner, Lily sees Atlas working at the restaurant. She’s shocked. During a brief conversation, Atlas tells Lily he has a girlfriend but that he wishes they had run into each other a year ago. Lily doesn’t tell Ryle that she ran into Atlas and tries to avoid going back to the restaurant again. One night, when Ryle and Lily are hanging out, Ryle burns himself on a casserole dish he tries to take out of the oven without a mitt. When Lily laughs, Ryle pushes her, and she hits her head. She’s bleeding, and she feels horrified and heartbroken, immediately worrying she’s turned into her mother. He’s quickly apologetic and eventually she forgives him, saying that if anything violent happens again, she’ll leave him.
They go to dinner with Allysa and Marshall at the same restaurant where Atlas works to celebrate that Allysa and Marshall are going to have a baby. Atlas comes to the table and the waiter introduces him as the chef. Atlas notices that both Lily and Ryle are injured and intuits that Ryle hurt her. When they are alone, Atlas tells Lily to leave Ryle. When she refuses, he says she’s like her mother. Ryle sees them together, and he learns that the chef is Atlas, the boy from Lily’s past. It comes to blows and Atlas throws Ryle out of his restaurant. Lily assures Ryle that nothing is going on between her and Atlas. They enjoy a period of peace and decide to get married in Vegas. But Ryle’s jealousy continues to simmer. When Ryle discovers that Atlas has given Lily his phone number, he flies into a jealous rage and pushes Lily down the stairs. She’s badly injured. When Allysa finds out what happened, she insists Ryle tell Lily about his past. He confesses that, just like the young patient he lost the night they met, his brother died of a gunshot wound because Ryle accidentally shot him. He marks this as the origin of his rage. Lily forgives him, and they try to be together again.
Allysa and Marshall have a baby and name her after Ryle. The night Rylee is born, Lily comes home to find Ryle in a strange mood. He makes her read an article in the newspaper in which Atlas mentions a woman who is special to him and says that the name of his restaurant (Bib’s) means “Better in Boston.” Ryle has the magnet in his hand and has read all of Lily’s teenage journals. He attempts to rape Lily and headbutts her so hard she blacks out. She calls Atlas to come get her, and he takes her to the hospital, where she discovers she’s pregnant. She takes her time figuring out what she wants for her life, confused by her emotions for Atlas and by all her conflicting feelings of rage and love and hurt for Ryle. She gradually lets Ryle back into her life in a platonic way, telling him about the baby, though she’s unsure what she wants from him. 
When the baby is born, Lily and Ryle name her Emerson, after Ryle’s brother. Lily says she wants a divorce because she would never want her daughter to endure what she and her mother did. Ryle agrees, though he is heartbroken about it. They share custody of Emerson. One day, Lily runs into Atlas. He says his life is good enough for Lily now, so if she’s ever ready to fall in love again, he’s there for her. She says she’s ready, and they embrace. He says she can stop swimming."
Fascism,"For Whom The Bell Tolls opens in May 1937, at the height of the Spanish Civil War. An American man named Robert Jordan, who has left the United States to enlist on the Republican side in the war, travels behind enemy lines to work with Spanish guerrilla fighters, or guerrilleros, hiding in the mountains. The Republican command has assigned Robert Jordan the dangerous and difficult task of blowing up a Fascist-controlled bridge as part of a larger Republican offensive.
A peasant named Anselmo guides Robert Jordan to the guerrilla camp, which is hidden in a cave. Along the way, they encounter Pablo, the leader of the camp, who greets Robert Jordan with hostility and opposes the bridge operation because he believes it endangers the guerrilleros’ safety. Robert Jordan suspects that Pablo may betray or sabotage the mission.
At the camp, Robert Jordan meets Pilar, Pablo’s “woman.” A large, sturdy part-gypsy, Pilar appears to be the real leader of the band of guerrilleros. A rapport quickly develops between Robert Jordan and Pilar. During the course of the evening, Robert Jordan meets the six other inhabitants of the camp: the unreliable Rafael, feisty and foul-mouthed Agustín, dignified Fernando, old Primitivo, and brothers Andrés and Eladio. The camp also shelters a young woman named Maria, whom a band of Fascists raped not long before. Robert Jordan and Maria are immediately drawn to each other.
Robert Jordan and Anselmo leave the camp to scout out the bridge. When they return, Pablo publicly announces that neither he nor his guerrilleros will help blow up the bridge. Pilar and the others disagree, however, so Pablo sullenly gives in. Privately, Rafael urges Robert Jordan to kill Pablo, but Pilar insists that Pablo is not dangerous. That night, Maria comes out to join Robert Jordan as he sleeps outside. They profess love for each other and make love.
The next morning, Pilar leads Robert Jordan through the forest to consult with El Sordo, the leader of another band of guerrilleros, about the bridge operation. They take Maria along. El Sordo agrees to help with the mission, but both he and Robert Jordan are troubled by the fact that the bridge must be blown in daylight, which will make their retreat more difficult. On the way back to Pablo’s camp, Robert Jordan and Maria make love in the forest. When they catch up with Pilar, Maria confesses to Pilar that the earth moved as they made love. Pilar, impressed, says that such a thing happens no more than three times in a person’s lifetime.
Back at the camp, a drunken Pablo insults Robert Jordan, who tries to provoke Pablo, hoping to find an excuse to kill him. Pablo refuses to be provoked, even when Agustín hits him in the face. When Pablo steps away for a few minutes, the others agree that he is dangerous and must be killed. Robert Jordan volunteers to do it. Suddenly, Pablo returns and announces that he has changed his mind and will help with the bridge. Later that night, Maria comes outside to sleep with Robert Jordan again. They talk about their feeling that they are one person, that they share the same body.
In the morning, Robert Jordan wakes up, sees a Fascist cavalryman, and shoots him, awakening the camp. After breakfast, the group hears sounds of a fight in the distance, and Robert Jordan believes that the Fascists are attacking El Sordo’s camp. Agustín and Primitivo want to aid El Sordo, but Robert Jordan and Pilar know that it likely would be useless.
The scene shifts to El Sordo’s hill, which a group of Fascists is assaulting. El Sordo’s men play dead and manage to shoot the Fascist captain, but several minutes later, Fascist planes bomb the hilltop and kill everyone in El Sordo’s band. The ranking Fascist officer orders the beheading of all the corpses of El Sordo’s men.
The guerrilleros at Pablo’s camp, having heard the planes bomb El Sordo’s hill, feel glum as they eat lunch. Robert Jordan writes a dispatch to the Republican command recommending that both the bridge operation and the larger offensive be canceled, for the Fascists are aware of the plan and the operation will not succeed. He sends Andrés to deliver the dispatch to the headquarters of General Golz, a Republican leader. Maria again joins Robert Jordan in his sleeping bag that night, and they fantasize about their future life in Madrid.
Meanwhile, in Madrid, Robert Jordan’s friend, a Russian journalist named Karkov, learns that the Fascists know about the offensive the Republicans have planned for the next day. Karkov worries about Robert Jordan.
At two in the morning, Pilar wakes Robert Jordan and reports that Pablo has fled the camp with some of the explosives that were meant to blow the bridge. Though furious at first, Robert Jordan controls his anger and plans to carry out the operation anyway, with fewer explosives. He wakes up Maria, and as they make love, they feel the earth move again. Pablo suddenly returns just before dawn, claiming that he left in a moment of weakness. He says that he threw the explosives into the river but felt great loneliness after doing so. He has brought back five men with their horses from neighboring guerrilla bands to help. The fighters take their positions.
The scene shifts to Andrés, who has been traveling through the night to deliver Robert Jordan’s dispatch to General Golz. Crossing into Republican territory, Andrés is slowed when several suspicious but apathetic officers question him. When Andrés and his escort finally near Golz’s headquarters, a politician named André Marty suspects that they are Fascist spies and orders them arrested. Robert Jordan’s friend Karkov hears about the arrests and uses his influence to free the men. Robert Jordan’s dispatch finally reaches Golz but arrives too late. The Republican offensive already has begun and can no longer be stopped.
As dawn breaks, Robert Jordan and Anselmo descend on the bridge, shoot the Fascist sentries, and plant the explosives. Pilar arrives and says that Eladio has been killed, while Fernando, fatally wounded, must be left behind. When Robert Jordan detonates the explosives, the bridge falls, but shrapnel from the blast strikes Anselmo and kills him. Pablo emerges from below, saying that all five of his men are dead. Agustín accuses Pablo of shooting the men for their horses, and Pablo does not deny it.
As the group crosses the road in retreat, a Fascist bullet hits Robert Jordan’s horse, which tramples on Robert Jordan’s left leg, breaking it. Knowing that he must be left behind, Robert Jordan says goodbye to Maria, saying that he will be with her even if she goes. Pilar and Pablo lead Maria away.
Alone, Robert Jordan contemplates suicide but resolves to stay alive to hold off the Fascists. He is grateful for having lived, in his final few days, a full lifetime. For the first time, he feels “integrated,” in harmony with the world. As the Fascist lieutenant approaches, Robert Jordan takes aim, feeling his heart beating against the floor of the forest."
Manner,"Silas Marner is the weaver in the English countryside village of Raveloe in the early nineteenth century. Like many weavers of his time, he is an outsider—the object of suspicion because of his special skills and the fact that he has come to Raveloe from elsewhere. The villagers see Silas as especially odd because of the curious cataleptic fits he occasionally suffers. Silas has ended up in Raveloe because the members of his religious sect in Lantern Yard, an insular neighborhood in a larger town, falsely accused him of theft and excommunicated him.
	Much shaken after the accusation, Silas finds nothing familiar in Raveloe to reawaken his faith and falls into a numbing routine of solitary work. His one attempt at neighborliness backfires: when an herbal remedy he suggests for a neighbor’s illness works, he is rumored to be a sort of witch doctor. With little else to live for, Silas becomes infatuated with the money he earns for his work and hoards it, living off as little as possible. Every night he pulls his gold out from its hiding place beneath his floorboards to count it. He carries on in this way for fifteen years.
	Squire Cass is the wealthiest man in Raveloe, and his two eldest sons are Godfrey and Dunstan, or Dunsey. Dunsey is greedy and cruel, and enjoys tormenting Godfrey, the eldest son. Godfrey is good-natured but weak-willed, and, though secretly married to the opium addict Molly Farren, he is in love with Nancy Lammeter. Dunsey talked Godfrey into the marriage and repeatedly blackmails him with threats to reveal the marriage to their father. Godfrey gives Dunsey 100 pounds of the rent money paid to him by one of their father’s tenants. Godfrey then finds himself in a bind when Dunsey insists that Godfrey repay the sum himself. Dunsey once again threatens to reveal Godfrey’s marriage but, after some arguing, offers to sell Godfrey’s prize horse, Wildfire, to repay the loan.
	The next day, Dunsey meets with some friends who are hunting and negotiates the sale of the horse. Dunsey decides to participate in the hunt before finalizing the sale, and, in doing so, he has a riding accident that kills the horse. Knowing the rumors of Silas’s hoard, Dunsey makes plans to intimidate the weaver into lending him money. His walk home takes him by Silas’s cottage, and, finding the cottage empty, Dunsey steals the money instead.
	Silas returns from an errand to find his money gone. Overwhelmed by the loss, he runs to the local tavern for help and announces the theft to a sympathetic audience of tavern regulars. The theft becomes the talk of the village, and a theory arises that the thief might have been a peddler who came through the village some time before. Godfrey, meanwhile, is distracted by thoughts of Dunsey, who has not returned home. After hearing that Wildfire has been found dead, Godfrey decides to tell his father about the money, though not about his marriage. The Squire flies into a rage at the news, but does not do anything drastic to punish Godfrey.
	Silas is utterly disconsolate at the loss of his gold and numbly continues his weaving. Some of the townspeople stop by to offer their condolences and advice. Among these visitors, Dolly Winthrop stands out. Like many of the others, she encourages Silas to go to church—something he has not done since he was banished from Lantern Yard—but she is also gentler and more genuinely sympathetic.
	Nancy Lammeter arrives at Squire Cass’s famed New Year’s dance resolved to reject Godfrey’s advances because of his unsound character. However, Godfrey is more direct and insistent than he has been in a long time, and Nancy finds herself exhilarated by the evening in spite of her resolution. Meanwhile, Molly, Godfrey’s secret wife, is making her way to the Casses’ house to reveal the secret marriage. She has their daughter, a toddler, in her arms. Tiring after her long walk, Molly takes a draft of opium and passes out by the road. Seeing Silas’s cottage and drawn by the light of the fire, Molly’s little girl wanders through the open door and falls asleep at Silas’s hearth.
	Silas is having one of his fits at the time and does not notice the little girl enter his cottage. When he comes to, he sees her already asleep on his hearth, and is as stunned by her appearance as he was by the disappearance of his money. A while later, Silas traces the girl’s footsteps outside and finds Molly’s body lying in the snow. Silas goes to the Squire’s house to find the doctor, and causes a stir at the dance when he arrives with the baby girl in his arms. Godfrey, recognizing his daughter, accompanies the doctor to Silas’s cottage. When the doctor declares that Molly is dead, Godfrey realizes that his secret is safe. He does not claim his daughter, and Silas adopts her.
	Silas grows increasingly attached to the child and names her Eppie, after his mother and sister. With Dolly Winthrop’s help, Silas raises the child lovingly. Eppie begins to serve as a bridge between Silas and the rest of the villagers, who offer him help and advice and have come to think of him as an exemplary person because of what he has done. Eppie also brings Silas out of the benumbed state he fell into after the loss of his gold. In his newfound happiness, Silas begins to explore the memories of his past that he has long repressed.
	The novel jumps ahead sixteen years. Godfrey has married Nancy and Squire Cass has died. Godfrey has inherited his father’s house, but he and Nancy have no children. Their one daughter died at birth, and Nancy has refused to adopt. Eppie has grown into a pretty and spirited young woman, and Silas a contented father. The stone-pit behind Silas’s cottage is drained to water neighboring fields, and Dunsey’s skeleton is found at the bottom, along with Silas’s gold. The discovery frightens Godfrey, who becomes convinced that his own secrets are destined to be uncovered as well. He confesses the truth to Nancy about his marriage to Molly and fathering of Eppie. Nancy is not angry but regretful, saying that they could have adopted Eppie legitimately if Godfrey had told her earlier.
	That evening, Godfrey and Nancy decide to visit Silas’s cottage to confess the truth of Eppie’s lineage and claim her as their daughter. However, after hearing Godfrey and Nancy’s story, Eppie tells them she would rather stay with Silas than live with her biological father. Godfrey and Nancy leave, resigning themselves to helping Eppie from afar. The next day Silas decides to visit Lantern Yard to see if he was ever cleared of the theft of which he was accused years before. The town has changed almost beyond recognition, though, and Silas’s old chapel has been torn down to make way for a new factory. Silas realizes that his questions will never be answered, but he is content with the sense of faith he has regained through his life with Eppie. That summer Eppie is married to Aaron Winthrop, Dolly’s son. Aaron comes to live in Silas’s cottage, which has been expanded and refurbished at Godfrey’s expense."
Graver,"One night, a man called Jack murders a mother, a father, and a daughter. His final target is a baby boy whose room is at the top of the family home. When he reaches the baby’s crib he finds a stuffed teddy bear in the boy’s place. The boy, having escaped his crib earlier that evening, makes his way up the hill and into the graveyard. He is found by two ghosts, Mr. and Mrs. Owens, who wonder how he ended up there. The boy’s dead mother appears before them and begs them to protect her child. Jack enters the graveyard but is taken away by a shadowy stranger named Silas. That evening, the ghosts deliberate what to do with the child. Eventually, the Lady on the Grey, who shows up for every person’s death, gives her blessing and the child is given the Freedom and the Graveyard. Mr. and Mrs. Owens name him Nobody Owens. 
Later, four-year-old Bod befriends a five-year-old living girl named Scarlett Amber Perkins. They spend time together in the graveyard. One day they visit a mausoleum in the graveyard and encounter an imaginary corpse called the Indigo Man and the slithering creature named the Sleer. The Sleer tells them about the treasures it protects: a brooch, a goblet, and a knife. Outside the tomb, Scarlett’s parents worriedly search for her. The next time Bod sees Scarlett, Scarlett tells him that her family is moving to Scotland. 
When Bod is six years old, he is upset to learn that his guardian Silas will be leaving the graveyard and that he will be taken care of by Miss Lupescu. Miss Lupescu teaches Bod about the different creatures of the world and gives him food he hates. Feeling alone and underappreciated, Bod agrees to go on an adventure with three ghouls who take him through a ghoul-gate. Bod becomes increasingly afraid of the ghouls who suggest that he turn into a ghoul himself. Luckily, Miss Lupescu, in the shape of a menacing dog-like creature, rescues Bod and explains to him that she is a Hound of God. For the rest of the month before Silas’s return, Bod warms up to Miss Lupescu, even feeling sad when she leaves the graveyard. 
When Bod is eight years old, he meets a witch named Liza Hempstock in the unconsecrated portion of the graveyard named Potter’s Field. After hearing that Liza was not buried with a headstone to mark her grave, Bod takes it upon himself to buy her a headstone. He takes the brooch from the Sleer and heads to Abanazer Bolger’s antiques store in town. Transfixed by the brooch and curious to learn more about where Bod attained it, Abanazer locks Bod into a storage room. As Bod thinks about how to escape, Liza appears in the room. Liza, eavesdropping on Abanazer and his acquaintance Tom Hustings, learns that Bod is in danger. Liza casts a spell on Bod helping him Fade, so that when Abanazer and Tom return to the room he is invisible. Still locked inside the room, Bod and Liza hear the men argue about the brooch, until they eventually get into a physical fight and knock each other out. Bod escapes the room, retrieves the brooch, and picks up a black card with the name Jack written on it. 
On his way back to the graveyard, an angry and disappointed Silas intercepts Bod. Back at the graveyard, Bod returns the brooch to the Sleer. Before heading home, Bod, using a paintbrush and a paperweight he took from Abanazer’s store, makes a headstone for Liza.
A ten-year-old Bod witnesses the Danse Macabre, which is a special day in winter when the living and the dead dance with one another. In the book’s interlude, an organization of men from all over the world are eating dessert. One man tells Jack that he must finish the job—killing Bod—that he failed to do years ago. When Bod is eleven years old, Silas tells Bod what he knows about Jack. Bod suggests that it would be a good idea for him to go to school and learn about the world, so he can be prepared to defend himself against Jack. At first, Bod is able to go to school without any issues, but an altercation with two bullies forces Silas to pull him out in order to keep him safe. 
When Bod is fourteen years old, he reunites with Scarlett Amber Perkins after her mother separates from her father and returns to the town. Bod explains to Scarlett about his family’s murder, and to help Bod, Scarlett asks a local historian, Mr. Frost, to help her learn more. Mr. Frost tells Scarlett to bring Bod to his house so that he can reveal what he knows. 
At Mr. Frost’s house, Bod learns that he is, in fact, the man called Jack. Jack’s other associates appear and Bod hides Scarlett in the Indigo Man’s mausoleum. With the help of the ghosts of the graveyard, Bod gets rid of Jack’s associates, who followed him to the cemetery. In the process, Bod learns that they belong to an ancient order called the Jacks of All Trades who, according to a prophecy, must kill Bod in order to save themselves. Jack holds Scarlett hostage in the mausoleum. When Bod arrives, he claims himself the master of the Sleer and the Sleer drags the man named Jack away. A frightened Scarlett calls Bod a monster, then has her memories erased by Silas. When Silas returns to Bod, he takes him out for pizza and reveals that Miss Lupescu died fighting against the Jacks of All Trades in Krakow. 
In the final chapter, fifteen-year-old Bod notices his ability to communicate with the dead is fading. Mr. Owens tells Bod that he was the best son he could’ve hoped for. Liza kisses Bod on his way to visit Silas and says that she will miss him. Bod doesn’t understand why the ghosts are acting this way. Silas explains to Bod that it is time that they must both leave the graveyard. Before Bod leaves, Miss Owens sings him a lullaby from his youth and expresses how proud of Bod she is. Bod knows that he will miss his family in the graveyard, but leaves knowing that it is now time to join the world of the living."
Situation,"Revolutionary and incendiary, The Second Sex is one of the earliest attempts to confront human history from a feminist perspective. It won de Beauvoir many admirers and just as many detractors. Today, many regard this massive and meticulously researched masterwork as not only as pillar of feminist thought but of twentieth-century philosophy in general.
De Beauvoir’s primary thesis is that men fundamentally oppress women by characterizing them, on every level, as the Other, defined exclusively in opposition to men. Man occupies the role of the self, or subject; woman is the object, the other. He is essential, absolute, and transcendent. She is inessential, incomplete, and mutilated. He extends out into the world to impose his will on it, whereas woman is doomed to immanence, or inwardness. He creates, acts, invents; she waits for him to save her. This distinction is the basis of all de Beauvoir’s later arguments.
De Beauvoir states that while it is natural for humans to understand themselves in opposition to others, this process is flawed when applied to the genders. In defining woman exclusively as Other, man is effectively denying her humanity.
The Second Sex chronicles de Beauvoir’s effort to locate the source of these profoundly imbalanced gender roles. In Book I, entitled “Facts and Myths,” she asks how “female humans” come to occupy a subordinate position in society. To answer this question—and to better understand her own identity—de Beauvoir first turns to biology, psychoanalysis, and historical materialism. These disciplines reveal indisputable “essential” differences between men and women but provide no justification for woman’s inferiority. They all take woman’s inferior “destiny” for granted.
She then moves to history to trace the emergence of male superiority in society, from nomadic hunter-gatherers through the French Revolution and contemporary times. Here she finds ample examples of female subordination, but again, no persuasive justification for them. History, she argues, is not an immutable “fact,” but a reflection of certain attitudes, preconceptions, and injustices.
De Beauvoir next discusses various mythical representations of women and demonstrates how these myths have imprinted human consciousness, often to the disservice of women. De Beauvoir hopes to debunk the persistent myth of the “eternal feminine” by showing that it arose from male discomfort with the fact of his own birth. Throughout history, maternity has been both worshipped and reviled: the mother both brings life and heralds death. These mysterious operations get projected onto the woman, who is transformed into a symbol of “life” and in the process is robbed of all individuality. To illustrate the prevalence of these myths, de Beauvoir studies the portrayal of women by five modern writers. In the end of this section, de Beauvoir examines the impact of these myths on individual experience. She concludes that the “eternal feminine” fiction is reinforced by biology, psychoanalysis, history, and literature.
De Beauvoir insists on the impossibility of comparing the “character” of men and women without considering the immense differences in their situation, and in Book II, entitled “Woman’s Life Today,” she turns to the concrete realities of this situation. She traces female development through its formative stages: childhood, youth, and sexual initiation. Her goal is to prove that women are not born “feminine” but shaped by a thousand external processes. She shows how, at each stage of her upbringing, a girl is conditioned into accepting passivity, dependence, repetition, and inwardness. Every force in society conspires to deprive her of subjectivity and flatten her into an object. Denied the possibility of independent work or creative fulfillment, the woman must accept a dissatisfying life of housework, childbearing, and sexual slavishness.
Having brought the woman to adulthood, de Beauvoir analyzes the various “situations,” or roles, the adult woman inhabits. The bourgeois woman performs three major functions: wife, mother, and entertainer. No matter how illustrious the woman’s household may be, these roles inevitably lead to immanence, incompleteness, and profound frustration. Even those who accept a less conventional place in society—as a prostitute or courtesan, for example—must submit to imperatives defined by the male. De Beauvoir also reflects on the trauma of old age. When a woman loses her reproductive capacity, she loses her primary purpose and therefore her identity. In the final chapter of this section, “Woman’s Situation and Character,” de Beauvoir reiterates the controversial claim that woman’s situation is not a result of her character. Rather, her character is a result of her situation. Her mediocrity, complacency, lack of accomplishment, laziness, passivity—all these qualities are the consequences of her subordination, not the cause.
In “Justifications,” de Beauvoir studies some of the ways that women reinforce their own dependency. Narcissists, women in love, and mystics all embrace their immanence by drowning selfhood in an external object—whether it be the mirror, a lover, or God. Throughout the book, de Beauvoir mentions such instances of females being complicit in their Otherness, particularly with regard to marriage. The difficulty of breaking free from “femininity”—of sacrificing security and comfort for some ill-conceived notion of “equality”—induces many women to accept the usual unfulfilling roles of wife and mother. From the very beginning of her discussion, de Beauvoir identifies the economic underpinnings of female subordination—and the economic roots of woman’s liberation. Only in work can she achieve autonomy. If woman can support herself, she can also achieve a form of liberation. In the concluding chapters of The Second Sex, de Beauvoir discusses the logistical hurdles woman faces in pursuing this goal."
Stuff,"The protagonist, who is named Tim O’Brien, begins by describing an event that occurred in the middle of his Vietnam experience. “The Things They Carried” catalogs the variety of things his fellow soldiers in the Alpha Company brought on their missions. Several of these things are intangible, including guilt and fear, while others are specific physical objects, including matches, morphine, M-16 rifles, and M&M’s candy.
Throughout the collection, the same characters reappear in various stories. The first member of the Alpha Company to die is Ted Lavender, a “grunt,” or low-ranking soldier, who deals with his anxiety about the war by taking tranquilizers and smoking marijuana. Lavender is shot in the head on his way back from going to the bathroom, and his superior, Lieutenant Jimmy Cross, blames himself for the tragedy. When Lavender is shot, Cross is distracting himself with thoughts of Martha, a college crush. It is revealed in “Love” that Cross’s feelings for Martha, whom he dated once before leaving for Vietnam, were never reciprocated, and that even twenty years after the war, his guilt over Lavender’s death remains.
In “On the Rainy River,” the narrator, O’Brien, explains the series of events that led him to Vietnam in the first place. He receives his draft notice in June of 1968, and his feelings of confusion drive him north to the Canadian border, which he contemplates crossing so that he will not be forced to fight in a war in which he doesn’t believe. Sitting in a rowboat with the proprietor of the Tip Top Lodge, where he stays, O’Brien decides that his guilt about avoiding the war and fear of disappointing his family are more important than his political convictions. He soon leaves, going first back home to Worthington, Minnesota and later to Vietnam.
In addition to Ted Lavender, a few other members of the Alpha Company are killed during their mission overseas, including Curt Lemon, who is killed when he steps on a rigged mortar round. Though O’Brien is not close to Lemon, in “The Dentist,” he tells a story of how Lemon, who faints before a routine checkup with an army-issued dentist, tries to save face by insisting that a perfectly good tooth be pulled. Lee Strunk, another member of the company, dies from injuries he sustains by stepping on a landmine. In “Friends,” O’Brien remembers that before Strunk was fatally hurt, Strunk and Dave Jensen had made a pact that if either man were irreparably harmed, the other man would see that he was quickly killed. However, when Strunk is actually hurt, he begs Jensen to spare him, and Jensen complies. Instead of being upset by the news of his friend’s swift death en route to treatment, Jensen is relieved.
The death that receives the most attention in The Things They Carried is that of Kiowa, a much-loved member of the Alpha Company and one of O’Brien’s closest friends. In “Speaking of Courage,” the story of Kiowa’s death is relayed in retrospect through the memory of Norman Bowker, years after the war. As Bowker drives around a lake in his Iowa hometown, he thinks that he failed to save Kiowa, who was killed when a mortar round hit and caused him to sink headfirst into a marshy field. O’Brien realizes that he has dealt with his guilt over Kiowa’s death differently than Norman Bowker in “Notes.” Just before the end of the war, O’Brien receives a long letter from Bowker that says he hasn’t found a way to make life meaningful after the war. O’Brien resolves to tell Bowker’s story, and the story of Kiowa’s death, in order to negotiate his own feelings of guilt and hollowness.
Like “Love” and “Notes,” several of O’Brien’s stories are told from a perspective twenty years after the Vietnam War, when he is a forty-three-year-old writer living in Massachusetts. Exposure to the guilt of old friends like Jimmy Cross and Norman Bowker prompts him to write stories in order to understand what they were going through. But two stories, “The Man I Killed” and “Ambush,” are written so that O’Brien can confront his own guilt over killing a man with a grenade outside the village of My Khe. In “The Man I Killed,” O’Brien imagines the life of his victim, from his childhood to the way things would have turned out for him had O’Brien not spotted him on a path and thrown a grenade at his feet. In “Ambush,” O’Brien imagines how he might relay the story of the man he killed to his nine-year-old daughter, Kathleen. In this second story, O’Brien provides more details of the actual killing—including the sound of the grenade and his own feelings—and explains that even well after the fact, he hasn’t finished sorting out the experience.
In the last story, “The Lives of the Dead,” O’Brien gives another twist to his contention that stories have the power to save people. In the stories of Curt Lemon and Kiowa, O’Brien explains that his imagination allowed him to grapple successfully with his guilt and confusion over the death of his fourth-grade first love, Linda."
Closely,"In Outliers: The Story of Success, Malcolm Gladwell considers the circumstances that lead to success. The first half of the book looks closely at how opportunities matter more in the lives of successful people than hard work or raw talent. The second half of the book focuses on cultural legacies: behavioral tendencies rooted in their ancestral past.
Part One examines the role of opportunity in the lives of extremely successful people. Gladwell’s first example is the Canadian Hockey League, the world’s most competitive youth hockey league. Since the cutoff date for the Canadian leagues that serve the youngest players is January 1, those born in the first part of the calendar year are much larger and more coordinated than their peers. The larger and more coordinated kids are given more playing time and better coaching, and thus become better players by the time they reach the top league. An overwhelming majority of Canadian professional hockey players have birthdays in January, February or March.
Gladwell proposes that 10,000 hours of practice is needed to master a skill, even for prodigies like Mozart. Bill Joy, Bill Gates, and the Beatles all worked hard to achieve success but benefited from opportunities they did not create. Joy, one of the founders of Sun Microsystems, happened to attend one of the first colleges in the world with a time-sharing terminal. In graduate school, he had a terminal in his room, where he spent all of his free time programming. Gates happened to attend a private high school with a time-sharing terminal connected to a mainframe in Seattle. He also was able to spend all of his free time programming. Early on, the Beatles were hired to play long shows day after day in Hamburg, Germany. 
Birth year or era is another form of opportunity. Gates and Joy (as well as other early programmers) all reached the end of their teen years just as personal computers became available to the public. In another example, fourteen of the top seventy-five richest people in the history of the world happened to be alive at the same time, in the same country: the United States in the mid-1800s.
Opportunity matters more than an individual’s IQ. Using a study conducted by Lewis Terman, the creator of the Stanford-Binet IQ test, Gladwell shows that “practical intelligence” is as important as “analytical intelligence.” He also contrasts Chris Langan, one of the world’s smartest living people, with Robert Oppenheimer. While both had difficulties in college, only Oppenheimer had a successful life, due to his practical intelligence.
The last portion of Part One looks at Joe Flom, a successful lawyer from New York City. While he was born into a poor family to Jewish immigrants (in a time when Jewish immigrants were not treated well), many of the disadvantages in his life were actually benefits and directly contributed to his success.
Part Two investigates cultural legacies. Using flight recorder transcripts from several plane crashes from the last few decades, Gladwell shows that cultural expectations and habits can be a severe hindrance to pilots. Copilots from countries that have a high “Power Distance Index” (those that show the most deference to authority) will often avoid telling pilots that they are making mistakes, even when the mistakes are potentially fatal. After recognizing the dangers of such cultural expectations, commercial aviation has instituted programs to change the way flight crews talk with one another. 
Gladwell next analyzes the disparity in public school math test scores between Eastern and Western countries. He suggests that the cultures in which rice paddy farming is historically important have a stronger work ethic. Using various examples, Gladwell shows that hard work has a greater impact on success in learning mathematics than intelligence. 
The final example is an examination of the KIPP school in the South Bronx and the “achievement gap” between socioeconomic groups. American students from middle-class and affluent households retain more information over summer vacation and are more likely to make additional gains than students from low-income households. The KIPP school uses longer school days and summer programming to eliminate the achievement gap for low-income children. While the work schedule is very rigorous, the school’s students go on to great academic success.
Gladwell demonstrates that if more opportunities were available, there would be far more successful people and the world would be richer for it."
Censorship,"Guy Montag is a fireman who burns books in a futuristic American city. In Montag’s world, firemen start fires rather than putting them out. The people in this society do not read books, enjoy nature, spend time by themselves, think independently, or have meaningful conversations. Instead, they drive very fast, watch excessive amounts of television on wall-size sets, and listen to the radio on “Seashell Radio” sets attached to their ears.
Montag encounters a gentle seventeen-year-old girl named Clarisse McClellan, who opens his eyes to the emptiness of his life with her innocently penetrating questions and her unusual love of people and nature. Over the next few days, Montag experiences a series of disturbing events. First, his wife, Mildred, attempts suicide by swallowing a bottle of sleeping pills. Then, when he responds to an alarm that an old woman has a stash of hidden literature, the woman shocks him by choosing to be burned alive along with her books. A few days later, he hears that Clarisse has been killed by a speeding car. Montag’s dissatisfaction with his life increases, and he begins to search for a solution in a stash of books that he has stolen from his own fires and hidden inside an air-conditioning vent.
When Montag fails to show up for work, his fire chief, Beatty, pays a visit to his house. Beatty explains that it’s normal for a fireman to go through a phase of wondering what books have to offer, and he delivers a dizzying monologue explaining how books came to be banned in the first place. According to Beatty, special-interest groups and other “minorities” objected to books that offended them. Soon, books all began to look the same, as writers tried to avoid offending anybody. This was not enough, however, and society as a whole decided to simply burn books rather than permit conflicting opinions. Beatty tells Montag to take twenty-four hours or so to see if his stolen books contain anything worthwhile and then turn them in for incineration. Montag begins a long and frenzied night of reading.
Overwhelmed by the task of reading, Montag looks to his wife for help and support, but she prefers television to her husband’s company and cannot understand why he would want to take the terrible risk of reading books. He remembers that he once met a retired English professor named Faber sitting in a park, and he decides that this man might be able to help him understand what he reads. He visits Faber, who tells him that the value of books lies in the detailed awareness of life that they contain. Faber says that Montag needs not only books but also the leisure to read them and the freedom to act upon their ideas.
Faber agrees to help Montag with his reading, and they concoct a risky scheme to overthrow the status quo. Faber will contact a printer and begin reproducing books, and Montag will plant books in the homes of firemen to discredit the profession and to destroy the machinery of censorship. Faber gives him a two-way radio earpiece (the “green bullet”) so that he can hear what Montag hears and talk to him secretly.
Montag goes home, and soon two of his wife’s friends arrive to watch television. The women discuss their families and the war that is about to be declared in an extremely frivolous manner. Their superficiality angers him, and he takes out a book of poetry and reads “Dover Beach” by Matthew Arnold. Faber buzzes in his ear for him to be quiet, and Mildred tries to explain that the poetry reading is a standard way for firemen to demonstrate the uselessness of literature. The women are extremely disturbed by the poem and leave to file a complaint against Montag.
Montag goes to the fire station and hands over one of his books to Beatty. Beatty confuses Montag by barraging him with contradictory quotations from great books. Beatty exploits these contradictions to show that literature is morbid and dangerously complex, and that it deserves incineration. Suddenly, the alarm sounds, and they rush off to answer the call, only to find that the alarm is at Montag’s own house. Mildred gets into a cab with her suitcase, and Montag realizes that his own wife has betrayed him.
Beatty forces Montag to burn the house himself; when he is done, Beatty places him under arrest. When Beatty continues to berate Montag, Montag turns the flamethrower on his superior and proceeds to burn him to ashes. Montag knocks the other firemen unconscious and runs. The Mechanical Hound, a monstrous machine that Beatty has set to attack Montag, pounces and injects Montag’s leg with a large dose of anesthetic. Montag manages to destroy it with his flamethrower; then he walks off the numbness in his leg and escapes with some books that were hidden in his backyard. He hides these in another fireman’s house and calls in an alarm from a pay phone.
Montag goes to Faber’s house, where he learns that a new Hound has been put on his trail, along with several helicopters and a television crew. Faber tells Montag that he is leaving for St. Louis to see a retired printer who may be able to help them. Montag gives Faber some money and tells him how to remove Montag’s scent from his house so the Hound will not enter it. Montag then takes some of Faber’s old clothes and runs off toward the river. The whole city watches as the chase unfolds on TV, but Montag manages to escape in the river and change into Faber’s clothes to disguise his scent. He drifts downstream into the country and follows a set of abandoned railroad tracks until he finds a group of renegade intellectuals (“the Book People”), led by a man named Granger, who welcome him. They are a part of a nationwide network of book lovers who have memorized many great works of literature and philosophy. They hope that they may be of some help to mankind in the aftermath of the war that has just been declared. Montag’s role is to memorize the Book of Ecclesiastes. Enemy jets appear in the sky and completely obliterate the city with bombs. Montag and his new friends move on to search for survivors and rebuild civilization."
Hills,"Hoping to cause a sensation in the field of parapsychology, Dr. John Montague rents Hill House, a secluded manor with a reputation for being haunted. He carefully selects two participants for his study—Eleanor Vance, a thirty-two-year-old woman who was reported to have had experiences with a poltergeist as a child, and Theodora, a woman marked in one of his lab’s studies as having psychic abilities. A third participant, Luke Sanderson, also joins the group. Luke stands to inherit Hill House after his aunt dies, and Luke’s aunt sends him to watch over the house and deter amateur ghost hunters. She also wants to keep Luke out of trouble since he is a liar and a thief.
Eleanor arrives at Hill House first. An instinct tells her to leave, but she stays and meets the house’s caretakers, Mr. and Mrs. Dudley. They are unwelcoming and urge her to go away, saying that they refuse to stay at the house after dark. Theodora arrives next, and Eleanor, a recluse, feels immediately drawn to Theodora’s warm, witty, and open personality. Eleanor lies and tells Theodora she has an apartment back home, when she actually lives at her sister’s house, where she sleeps on a cot. Eleanor was her mother’s primary caretaker up until her mother’s death a few months prior. She is just beginning to explore her freedom and is elated to have found a new friend.
Dr. Montague and Luke arrive next. Dr. Montague reluctantly tells the group about the house’s history after dinner—he doesn’t want to scare anyone into leaving, since the last tenant to leave at night died when his horse crushed him against the oak tree in the driveway. Dr. Montague explains that the house was built eighty years ago by a man named Hugh Crain. Crain designed Hill House as a series of cloistered, maze-like concentric circles that are almost impossible to navigate. Tragically, Crain’s wife never set foot into the house; she died when her carriage overturned in the driveway. Bitter and depressed, Crain stayed to raise his two daughters in the house. Over the years, the daughters fought over ownership of the house, and the house eventually landed in the hands of the older sister’s caretaker, a young woman from town. Taunted and harassed by the younger sister and the townspeople, the young woman hanged herself, reportedly in the house’s turret.
Over the first week of their stay, the group experiences a series of unexplainable events. One night, the women hear a loud banging on the door and feel a chilling breeze. The men see a mysterious animal run down the hallway. Outside the nursery, they discover a mysterious cold spot. Inside the library, Eleanor detects an awful odor. Finally, Luke discovers the words HELP ELEANOR COME HOME written in chalk in the halls. With each event, the group grows more suspicious of Eleanor, and Eleanor is terrified by the thought that the house is singling her out.
The odd events continue. When Theodora finds the words HELP ELEANOR COME HOME ELEANOR written in blood on her walls, she lashes out at Eleanor, who she suspects is doing these things to get attention. Meanwhile, Eleanor feels herself losing grasp of her senses and at the same time becoming more connected to Theodora. At one point, Dr. Montague assures everyone that ghosts can’t cause them physical harm—only fear can do that. Still, Theodora and Eleanor continue to experience strange events that are hard to recall yet hard to deny.
Mrs. Montague, a parapsychologist, arrives at Hill House with her friend, Arthur. Belittling her husband and his lack of progress, she confidently declares that she will draw out Hill House’s spirits. Mrs. Montague believes that spirits feel lonely and want to connect, but they need to be coaxed into communicating. To accomplish this, she uses a device called a planchette. Mrs. Montague reports that a spirit named “Nell” spoke to her, saying it wanted to go home. The group, deeply disturbed, continues to watch Eleanor with suspicion while growing more fearful of the house. That night, Dr. Montague, Luke, Theodora, and Eleanor stay in a room together to keep watch. They hear terrible banging sounds on the door while Mrs. Montague and Arthur sleep in nearby rooms, undisturbed.
Eleanor realizes that she can hear any sound that occurs inside the house, no matter which room she is in. She believes that she is merging with the house and can sense things that the others can’t. Eleanor wakes up one night and goes to the library, aware that she’s not acting entirely of her own volition. She hears a voice that sounds like her mother’s and chases it throughout the house. Trying to avoid the others, who now realize that she’s roaming the house alone, Eleanor retreats back to the library and climbs a rickety iron stairway to the turret. The others gather underneath it and worry that the stairway will collapse, but Luke climbs up and ushers Eleanor back down to safety.
The next morning, the group agrees that Eleanor must leave Hill House. Eleanor cries and says she has nowhere to go, claiming that Hill House is now her home. Dr. Montague, worried for Eleanor’s sanity, says she must leave at once. Eleanor finally agrees, and the group watches as she begins to drive down the driveway. As she departs, however, Eleanor pities the group for believing that they can thwart Hill House’s desire to keep her—she believes that she belongs to the house. She accelerates toward the oak tree, and right before she crashes and dies, she wonders why she is doing this and why no one is stopping her. After Eleanor’s suicide, the group leaves Hill House. Dr. Montague later publishes his study, but his colleagues ridicule his findings."
Ethnic,"Oluo uses the introduction to establish herself as a Black woman who is both proud of her culture and constantly hindered by America’s racism and the social injustice that permeates its society. She is ready to demand change, as are many Black people in an internet age that allows the documentation and validation of their experiences. White people might find these conversations uncomfortable or even scary, but it is far past time for America to address white supremacy and its fundamental, systemic inequities. 
Social change cannot be made in America without considering race, because racial disparities permeate every aspect of society. American society, and especially the American economy, rest on the premise that people of color are born inferior to white people. Even Obama’s election only reaffirmed white America’s denial of racism while spurring white people on to demand more in comparison with their Black and brown counterparts. Racism is systemic, affecting every part of American life. Individual exceptions do not invalidate the overall, cumulative experience of social inequality and oppression. White people do not experience racism, so they need to listen to people of color and trust the validity of their experiences. 
Racism is not limited to the fear or hatred that a white person might feel toward a Black person. It’s the system of inequality perpetuated by the government, business, and education. Only this definition offers the hope of systemic change while demanding that majority individuals face their privilege, their racism, and their role in the fight. Because America is a racist society, white people are guaranteed to make mistakes when talking about it. That fact cannot become an excuse to stop trying, although good intentions are no longer sufficient. White people must apologize and learn to do better when they make hurtful comments. A good start is for everyone to understand the extent of their privilege. The exercise is not intended to inflict guilt but to force everyone to realize the ways in which their lived experiences are different than those of others. That understanding can help everyone demand change in the places where they exercise power.  
People’s identities are compilations of many factors. Intersectionality is a viewpoint that acknowledges all of these factors so people can be respected and valued for all of their identities, whether Black, mixed, male, female, feminist, scholar, artist, and so on. It’s a tough task because it slows social progress and demands empathy, but without it, any social progress only establishes a new hierarchy that then serves to oppress another group of people.  
The book’s central chapters address a variety of racial topics. Police in America treat Black people differently because of racism’s systemic nature. White people have trouble acknowledging this fact because doing so requires they admit the ways racism benefits them. Affirmative action is an admittedly flawed program that nevertheless benefits minorities and should be continued but also advanced. Teachers and school administrators see Black children as larger, older, more aggressive, and less intelligent than their white counterparts, so Black children are disciplined more often and more harshly, leading to their criminalization and institutionalization. The word “n*****” is intrinsically harmful, and even free speech does not justify its use. Also painful is the adoption of a culture’s customs (i.e., cultural appropriation), while benefiting financially from them, not acknowledging their historical development, and not having to share in the struggles that formed them. Touching a Black person’s hair continues America’s racist history of treating Black people’s bodies as white people’s property. It denies a Black person’s autonomy, agency, and right to personal space.  
In the final five chapters, Oluo addresses the painful effects of cumulative acts of systemic racism, beginning with microaggressions. These thoughtless or cruel comments and behaviors accumulate, resulting in psychological damage. Black people have the right to call out these comments and behaviors and to demand an apology. Oluo then discusses that despite the best efforts of previous generations, young Black people have inherited a deeply unjust America, and adults must trust them to carry the battle forward. Racism’s systemic nature is maintained in part by the argument that some Black people, such as Martin Luther King, Jr., are “good” activists who deserve social equality while others, such as Malcolm X, are not. The dichotomy is false; either every person is equal, or America is doomed to forever be a white supremacy. Finally, Oluo encourages her readers to move beyond talking about racism and to take actions to make society truly equal for all."
Shortcuts,"Gulliver’s Travels recounts the story of Lemuel Gulliver, a practical-minded Englishman trained as a surgeon who takes to the seas when his business fails. In a deadpan first-person narrative that rarely shows any signs of self-reflection or deep emotional response, Gulliver narrates the adventures that befall him on these travels.
Gulliver’s adventure in Lilliput begins when he wakes after his shipwreck to find himself bound by innumerable tiny threads and addressed by tiny captors who are in awe of him but fiercely protective of their kingdom. They are not afraid to use violence against Gulliver, though their arrows are little more than pinpricks. But overall, they are hospitable, risking famine in their land by feeding Gulliver, who consumes more food than a thousand Lilliputians combined could. Gulliver is taken into the capital city by a vast wagon the Lilliputians have specially built. He is presented to the emperor, who is entertained by Gulliver, just as Gulliver is flattered by the attention of royalty. Eventually Gulliver becomes a national resource, used by the army in its war against the people of Blefuscu, whom the Lilliputians hate for doctrinal differences concerning the proper way to crack eggs. But things change when Gulliver is convicted of treason for putting out a fire in the royal palace with his urine and is condemned to be shot in the eyes and starved to death. Gulliver escapes to Blefuscu, where he is able to repair a boat he finds and set sail for England.
After staying in England with his wife and family for two months, Gulliver undertakes his next sea voyage, which takes him to a land of giants called Brobdingnag. Here, a field worker discovers him. The farmer initially treats him as little more than an animal, keeping him for amusement. The farmer eventually sells Gulliver to the queen, who makes him a courtly diversion and is entertained by his musical talents. Social life is easy for Gulliver after his discovery by the court, but not particularly enjoyable. Gulliver is often repulsed by the physicality of the Brobdingnagians, whose ordinary flaws are many times magnified by their huge size. Thus, when a couple of courtly ladies let him play on their naked bodies, he is not attracted to them but rather disgusted by their enormous skin pores and the sound of their torrential urination. He is generally startled by the ignorance of the people here—even the king knows nothing about politics. More unsettling findings in Brobdingnag come in the form of various animals of the realm that endanger his life. Even Brobdingnagian insects leave slimy trails on his food that make eating difficult. On a trip to the frontier, accompanying the royal couple, Gulliver leaves Brobdingnag when his cage is plucked up by an eagle and dropped into the sea.
Next, Gulliver sets sail again and, after an attack by pirates, ends up in Laputa, where a floating island inhabited by theoreticians and academics oppresses the land below, called Balnibarbi. The scientific research undertaken in Laputa and in Balnibarbi seems totally inane and impractical, and its residents too appear wholly out of touch with reality. Taking a short side trip to Glubbdubdrib, Gulliver is able to witness the conjuring up of figures from history, such as Julius Caesar and other military leaders, whom he finds much less impressive than in books. After visiting the Luggnaggians and the Struldbrugs, the latter of which are senile immortals who prove that age does not bring wisdom, he is able to sail to Japan and from there back to England.
Finally, on his fourth journey, Gulliver sets out as captain of a ship, but after the mutiny of his crew and a long confinement in his cabin, he arrives in an unknown land. This land is populated by Houyhnhnms, rational-thinking horses who rule, and by Yahoos, brutish humanlike creatures who serve the Houyhnhnms. Gulliver sets about learning their language, and when he can speak he narrates his voyages to them and explains the constitution of England. He is treated with great courtesy and kindness by the horses and is enlightened by his many conversations with them and by his exposure to their noble culture. He wants to stay with the Houyhnhnms, but his bared body reveals to the horses that he is very much like a Yahoo, and he is banished. Gulliver is grief-stricken but agrees to leave. He fashions a canoe and makes his way to a nearby island, where he is picked up by a Portuguese ship captain who treats him well, though Gulliver cannot help now seeing the captain—and all humans—as shamefully Yahoolike. Gulliver then concludes his narrative with a claim that the lands he has visited belong by rights to England, as her colonies, even though he questions the whole idea of colonialism."
Feet,"Estrella is a young girl on the verge of womanhood. Her family includes her mother Petra, four younger siblings, and an older man, Perfecto. The family are migrants, living wherever they find work picking crops. As the story begins, the family are driving through an orchard to a run-down bungalow, where they will stay during the coming weeks. Petra, who is devout, sets up an altar in the house, where she can pray before statues of Jesus, Mary, and Joseph. She worries about keeping her family safe. She always makes sure there is a circle drawn in the dirt around the house at night, to keep away scorpions. Not far from the house stands an old, decaying barn. It fascinates the children, especially Estrella. 
Estrella’s father left the family some years ago. When Perfecto became Petra’s companion, Estrella resented him. However, they get along better now. He taught her how to use the tools in his toolbox, and sometimes they work on small jobs together, like patching a hole in a wall. Privately, however, Perfecto is unhappy and anxious. He was once married, but the children from that marriage are grown, and his wife died of cancer. Now Petra is pregnant, and the burden of being a family man at his age increasingly seems too much to bear. He is thinking of leaving. When he is hired to dismantle the barn, he sees it as an opportunity to earn enough money to go back to Mexico by himself. He tries to persuade Estrella to help him with the job.
Alejo and Gumecindo are cousins. Like Estrella’s family, they work in the fields. They also earn a little extra money on the side, by stealing peaches from the orchard to sell on weekends. Alejo and Estrella meet and are attracted to one another. Petra is unhappy about this development, but she knows there isn’t much she can do. One day, while Alejo is up in a tree picking peaches, a crop-dusting plane flies overhead and drenches him with pesticide. Alejo feels sick, but at first he is able to keep working. He and Estrella spend more time together and grow closer. Soon, however, Alejo becomes too sick to work. He is also too sick to travel. Gumecindo wants to look after his cousin but also needs to return home for school. Petra solves Gumecindo’s dilemma by agreeing to take Alejo in and care for him. Perfecto objects, but Petra sees Alejo’s situation as a test of her willingness to care for others in need. 
Unfortunately, it eventually becomes clear that Alejo needs professional treatment. The family takes him to a clinic, where a nurse charges the family ten dollars to tell them that Alejo needs to go to a hospital. The family needs that money for gas, but Perfecto pays the nurse, not knowing what else do to. Estrella, out of patience, bashes the nurse’s desk with a crowbar and makes her give back the money Perfecto just paid. The family takes Alejo to the hospital and leaves him there. Alejo begs Estrella to stay by his side, but she cannot. 
Back at the house, Perfecto realizes that the police are probably searching for the family. The best time to leave is now. Petra, sensing what is on Perfecto’s mind, goes inside and prays at the altar. When the statue of Jesus falls and breaks, Petra thinks to herself that Perfecto is the one to repair it. During the commotion, Estrella steps outside. Ignoring Petra’s warnings, she makes her way to the mysterious barn and climbs up onto the roof. As the story ends, Estrella sits beneath the starry sky and feels the power of her own heart."
Process,"An ambitious, worldly young bank official named Joseph K. is arrested by two warders ""one fine morning,"" although he has done nothing wrong. K. is indignant and outraged. The morning happens to be that of his thirtieth birthday. One year later, on the morning of his thirty-first birthday, two warders again come for K. They take him to a quarry outside of town and kill him in the name of the Law. K. lets them.

The Trial is the chronicle of that intervening year of K.'s case, his struggles and encounters with the invisible Law and the untouchable Court. It is an account, ultimately, of state-induced self-destruction. Yet, as in all of Kafka's best writing, the ""meaning"" is far from clear. Just as the parable related by the chaplain in Chapter Nine (called ""The Doorkeeper"" or ""Before the Law"") elicits endless commentary from students of the Law, so has The Trial been a touchstone of twentieth-century critical interpretation. As some commentators have noted, it has, in parts, the quality of revealed truth; as such it is ultimately unresolvable--a mirror for any sectarian reading.
How to summarize this kind of text? It was written during 1914-1915, while Kafka was an official in the Workmen's Accident Insurance Institute for the Kingdom of Bohemia. On one level we can see in The Trial a satirical pillorying of the Austro-Hungarian bureaucracy of Kafka's day. Yet to many readers it is eerily prescient of the psychological weaponry used by the much more insidious totalitarian regimes to come, of the legally-sanctioned death machines Kafka never lived to see. It is also an unfinished novel, and this is apparent in the final chapters. It is at times as suffocating to read as the airless rooms of the Court that it describes. The German title, Der Prozess, connotes both a ""trial"" and a ""process,"" and it is perhaps this maddening feeling of inevitability that leaves a lasting visceral impression: the machinery has been set in motion, and the process will grind toward conclusion despite our most desperate exhortations."
Humanity,"Lawyer Bryan Stevenson gives a first-person account of his decades helping marginalized Americans who have been unfairly and harshly punished by the U.S. criminal justice system, which disproportionately targets people of color and poor people. At the heart of Just Mercy is the story of Walter McMillian, a Black man who was framed for the murder of a girl named Ronda Morrison, convicted, and sent to death row. 
Stevenson alternates chapters about Walter with his personal reflections on our country’s history with racial disparity and issues around incarceration. Stevenson highlights other groups of vulnerable people who have been victimized by the criminal justice system and shares the stories of the prisoners he has helped over the years. The book also follows the growth of Stevenson’s nonprofit law project, the Alabama-based Equal Justice Initiative (EJI), through its expansion from focusing on death row prisoners to helping people sentenced to life without parole. Stevenson chronicles how EJI becomes a significant force in criminal justice reform.
In 1983 as a law student, Stevenson discovers his life’s passion when he interns with the Georgia-based Southern Prisoners Defense Committee and meets his first death row prisoner. After graduation Stevenson accepts a job with the organization to represent poor prisoners, including those in Alabama who lack any public defender. He meets Walter McMillian on Alabama’s death row. Walter owns a successful business but also transgresses racial boundaries when he has an affair with a white woman. Soon after the affair becomes public, the woman’s friend, Ralph Myers, accuses Walter of committing the unsolved murder of Ronda Morrison, which has outraged the community. Law enforcement, including a racist sheriff and the district attorney, eagerly pounces on this accusation, overlooking Walter’s alibi and a lack of evidence. Instead, they actively force Ralph to stick with his story even when he tries to recant. They coerce other false witness testimonies, and—as revealed years later—actively suppress evidence.
After Stevenson and the team at EJI unsuccessfully appeal Walter’s conviction, they launch their own investigation of the crime and uncover new evidence. They find witnesses who can prove the witnesses against Walter lied as well as financial records that indicate that one of these witnesses was paid to give false testimony. Stevenson and his team also petition for and receive all records from Walter’s trial. However, their big break comes when they receive a phone call from Ralph, who now wants to make amends. Ralph admits to lying about Walter and says he was threatened by law enforcement. Stevenson wins a hearing for Walter where he can present his new evidence: Ralph’s testimony, which is confirmed by health care workers and other inmates, as well as recordings of the law enforcement team threatening Ralph if he doesn’t frame Walter. 
While the judge refuses to grant Walter relief, Stevenson continues the appeal process through the Alabama courts. The district attorney asks outside agents to investigate the murder for which Walter was convicted, and the investigators determine that Walter had nothing to do with the crime. Six weeks later, the court invalidates Walter’s conviction. Stevenson and the State file a joint motion to dismiss the charges, and Walter is set free.
Throughout the process, Stevenson and Walter become close friends, and Stevenson helps Walter upon his release, including filing a civil suit on his behalf and offering him a place to stay. Walter works with Stevenson to share his story, giving interviews and speaking at legal conferences, and Walter is even featured in a documentary. Unfortunately, Walter is diagnosed with advancing dementia and is forced to rely on family and eventually a nursing facility for his care. He dies in 2013. Stevenson gives a eulogy at his funeral and shares all he learned from Walter, particularly that we must extend mercy to everyone, even those who have not earned it.
Interspersed with chapters chronicling Walter’s narrative are stories of Stevenson’s other clients and work. His closeness with these prisoners and their horrifying circumstances makes Stevenson more determined to help and causes him to reflect on abstract issues that nevertheless imbue the criminal justice system, like humanity and mercy. Stevenson focuses on several categories of vulnerable people who become trapped in the system, including mentally ill prisoners, disabled prisoners, and poor women who give birth to stillborn babies. 
Stevenson and his team at EJI also become increasingly focused on juvenile offenders who are sometimes tried as adults despite their young age. These offenders may be given de facto death sentences by being sentenced to life without parole and face perilous circumstances when they are housed in adult prisons. Stevenson illustrates how these prisoners retain their own humanity while being forced to live under inhumane conditions. He also discusses some of the qualities common among these types of prisoners: They are generally poor and disproportionately people of color, and most of them lack adequate legal counsel. The juveniles have horrific backgrounds of abuse and neglect.
Stevenson and his team at EJI also work to change the legal system to offer more protection to marginalized people. Several of his cases end up before the U.S. Supreme Court, and he succeeds in winning rulings that ban as unconstitutional the conviction of children to life without parole and the execution of people deemed incompetent from dementia or neurological disease. EJI works to raise public awareness of issues surrounding unfair incarceration, produces groundbreaking reports on racial issues, and sets up programs to help formerly incarcerated people adjust to life on the outside.
Stevenson also reflects on the issues that surround the criminal justice system. His time spent with prisoners awaiting their execution makes him realize how inhumane it is to prepare another human to die. After decades of work, when Stevenson fails to prevent the execution of a man who suffers from an intellectual disability, he momentarily feels unable to continue his work. However, he realizes that he cannot help but be broken by his experiences and comes to understand that it is his own brokenness that allows him to more fully understand the need for mercy and to bring compassion to others. The book ends with Stevenson’s renewed commitment to helping others."
Define,"The Catcher in the Rye is set around the 1950s and is narrated by a young man named Holden Caulfield. Holden is not specific about his location while he’s telling the story, but he makes it clear that he is undergoing treatment in a mental hospital or sanatorium. The events he narrates take place in the few days between the end of the fall school term and Christmas, when Holden is sixteen years old.
Holden’s story begins on the Saturday following the end of classes at the Pencey prep school in Agerstown, Pennsylvania. Pencey is Holden’s fourth school; he has already failed out of three others. At Pencey, he has failed four out of five of his classes and has received notice that he is being expelled, but he is not scheduled to return home to Manhattan until Wednesday. He visits his elderly history teacher, Spencer, to say goodbye, but when Spencer tries to reprimand him for his poor academic performance, Holden becomes annoyed.
Back in the dormitory, Holden is further irritated by his unhygienic neighbor, Ackley, and by his own roommate, Stradlater. Stradlater spends the evening on a date with Jane Gallagher, a girl whom Holden used to date and whom he still admires. During the course of the evening, Holden grows increasingly nervous about Stradlater’s taking Jane out, and when Stradlater returns, Holden questions him insistently about whether he tried to have sex with her. Stradlater teases Holden, who flies into a rage and attacks Stradlater. Stradlater pins Holden down and bloodies his nose. Holden decides that he’s had enough of Pencey and will go to Manhattan three days early, stay in a hotel, and not tell his parents that he is back.
On the train to New York, Holden meets the mother of one of his fellow Pencey students. Though he thinks this student is a complete “bastard,” he tells the woman made-up stories about how shy her son is and how well respected he is at school. When he arrives at Penn Station, he goes into a phone booth and considers calling several people, but for various reasons he decides against it. He gets in a cab and asks the cab driver where the ducks in Central Park go when the lagoon freezes, but his question annoys the driver. Holden has the cab driver take him to the Edmont Hotel, where he checks himself in.
From his room at the Edmont, Holden can see into the rooms of some of the guests in the opposite wing. He observes a man putting on silk stockings, high heels, a bra, a corset, and an evening gown. He also sees a man and a woman in another room taking turns spitting mouthfuls of their drinks into each other’s faces and laughing hysterically. He interprets the couple’s behavior as a form of sexual play and is both upset and aroused by it. After smoking a couple of cigarettes, he calls Faith Cavendish, a woman he has never met but whose number he got from an acquaintance at Princeton. Holden thinks he remembers hearing that she used to be a stripper, and he believes he can persuade her to have sex with him. He calls her, and though she is at first annoyed to be called at such a late hour by a complete stranger, she eventually suggests that they meet the next day. Holden doesn’t want to wait that long and winds up hanging up without arranging a meeting.
Holden goes downstairs to the Lavender Room and sits at a table, but the waiter realizes he’s a minor and refuses to serve him. He flirts with three women in their thirties, who seem like they’re from out of town and are mostly interested in catching a glimpse of a celebrity. Nevertheless, Holden dances with them and feels that he is “half in love” with the blonde one after seeing how well she dances. After making some wisecracks about his age, they leave, letting him pay their entire tab.
As Holden goes out to the lobby, he starts to think about Jane Gallagher and, in a flashback, recounts how he got to know her. They met while spending a summer vacation in Maine, played golf and checkers, and held hands at the movies. One afternoon, during a game of checkers, her stepfather came onto the porch where they were playing, and when he left Jane began to cry. Holden had moved to sit beside her and kissed her all over her face, but she wouldn’t let him kiss her on the mouth. That was the closest they came to “necking.”
Holden leaves the Edmont and takes a cab to Ernie’s jazz club in Greenwich Village. Again, he asks the cab driver where the ducks in Central Park go in the winter, and this cabbie is even more irritable than the first one. Holden sits alone at a table in Ernie’s and observes the other patrons with distaste. He runs into Lillian Simmons, one of his older brother’s former girlfriends, who invites him to sit with her and her date. Holden says he has to meet someone, leaves, and walks back to the Edmont.
Maurice, the elevator operator at the Edmont, offers to send a prostitute to Holden’s room for five dollars, and Holden agrees. A young woman, identifying herself as “Sunny,” arrives at his door. She pulls off her dress, but Holden starts to feel “peculiar” and tries to make conversation with her. He claims that he recently underwent a spinal operation and isn’t sufficiently recovered to have sex with her, but he offers to pay her anyway. She sits on his lap and talks dirty to him, but he insists on paying her five dollars and showing her the door. Sunny returns with Maurice, who demands another five dollars from Holden. When Holden refuses to pay, Maurice punches him in the stomach and leaves him on the floor, while Sunny takes five dollars from his wallet. Holden goes to bed.
He wakes up at ten o’clock on Sunday and calls Sally Hayes, an attractive girl whom he has dated in the past. They arrange to meet for a matinee showing of a Broadway play. He eats breakfast at a sandwich bar, where he converses with two nuns about Romeo and Juliet. He gives the nuns ten dollars. He tries to telephone Jane Gallagher, but her mother answers the phone, and he hangs up. He takes a cab to Central Park to look for his younger sister, Phoebe, but she isn’t there. He helps one of Phoebe’s schoolmates tighten her skate, and the girl tells him that Phoebe might be in the Museum of Natural History. Though he knows that Phoebe’s class wouldn’t be at the museum on a Sunday, he goes there anyway, but when he gets there he decides not to go in and instead takes a cab to the Biltmore Hotel to meet Sally.
Holden and Sally go to the play, and Holden is annoyed that Sally talks with a boy she knows from Andover afterward. At Sally’s suggestion, they go to Radio City to ice skate. They both skate poorly and decide to get a table instead. Holden tries to explain to Sally why he is unhappy at school, and actually urges her to run away with him to Massachusetts or Vermont and live in a cabin. When she refuses, he calls her a “pain in the ass” and laughs at her when she reacts angrily. She refuses to listen to his apologies and leaves.
Holden calls Jane again, but there is no answer. He calls Carl Luce, a young man who had been Holden’s student advisor at the Whooton School and who is now a student at Columbia University. Luce arranges to meet him for a drink after dinner, and Holden goes to a movie at Radio City to kill time. Holden and Luce meet at the Wicker Bar in the Seton Hotel. At Whooton, Luce had spoken frankly with some of the boys about sex, and Holden tries to draw him into a conversation about it once more. Luce grows irritated by Holden’s juvenile remarks about gay men and about Luce’s Chinese girlfriend, and he makes an excuse to leave early. Holden continues to drink Scotch and listen to the pianist and singer.
Quite drunk, Holden telephones Sally Hayes and babbles about their Christmas Eve plans. Then he goes to the lagoon in Central Park, where he used to watch the ducks as a child. It takes him a long time to find it, and by the time he does, he is freezing cold. He then decides to sneak into his own apartment building and wake his sister, Phoebe. He is forced to admit to Phoebe that he was kicked out of school, which makes her mad at him. When he tries to explain why he hates school, she accuses him of not liking anything. He tells her his fantasy of being “the catcher in the rye,” a person who catches little children as they are about to fall off of a cliff. Phoebe tells him that he has misremembered the poem that he took the image from: Robert Burns’s poem says “if a body meet a body, coming through the rye,” not “catch a body.”
Holden calls his former English teacher, Mr. Antolini, who tells Holden he can come to his apartment. Mr. Antolini asks Holden about his expulsion and tries to counsel him about his future. Holden can’t hide his sleepiness, and Mr. Antolini puts him to bed on the couch. Holden awakens to find Mr. Antolini stroking his forehead. Thinking that Mr. Antolini is making a sexual overture, Holden hastily excuses himself and leaves, sleeping for a few hours on a bench at Grand Central Station.
Holden goes to Phoebe’s school and sends her a note saying that he is leaving home for good and that she should meet him at lunchtime at the museum. When Phoebe arrives, she is carrying a suitcase full of clothes, and she asks Holden to take her with him. He refuses angrily, and she cries and then refuses to speak to him. Knowing she will follow him, he walks to the zoo, and then takes her across the park to a carousel. He buys her a ticket and watches her ride it. It starts to rain heavily, but Holden is so happy watching his sister ride the carousel that he is close to tears.
Holden ends his narrative here, telling the reader that he is not going to tell the story of how he went home and got “sick.” He plans to go to a new school in the fall and is cautiously optimistic about his future."
Applied,"Educated is primarily retrospective, consisting of Tara Westover's memories about her past. She tells the story of the events of her life from a vantage point in her late twenties, occasionally interjecting to comment on the process of trying to arrive at an accurate version of the past. Tara was born the youngest of seven children to parents whom she refers to as Faye and Gene (pseudonyms). The Westover family lived on a farm in rural Idaho, where Gene made a living salvaging scrap metal while Faye worked as an unlicensed midwife and herbal healer. Gene suffered from paranoid fears about interference from the federal government, and as a result he refused to allow his children to attend school, receive birth certificates, or receive medical attention. Gene was also a devout Mormon who believed in radical self-sufficiency and an impending Day of Judgement.
		
Shifts in the Westover family dynamic began to emerge when Tara was about nine. Her mother's work as a midwife increased her sense of independence, but after sustaining a serious and untreated brain injury in a car accident, Faye began to lose confidence in her skills, and focused instead on using herbal remedies and a form of intuitive healing. Around this time, Tyler (the third son) announced that he was going to attend college, which estranged him from his family. Tyler's absence forced Tara to become more involved in helping her father with his scrapping work, which left her constantly exposed to the possibility of dangerous injury. It also made her more curious about possibly pursuing an education herself. When Tara was ten, she told her disapproving father that she wanted to begin going to school, but nothing came of the idea.
As Tara grew into her teens, she acquired more independence from her family due to taking on various jobs and pursuing singing and musical theatre in the local community. However, her life was dominated by the strict rules and religious doctrine her father imposed, and Tara often worried about becoming sinful. When Tara was thirteen, her older brother Shawn moved back home. At first Shawn and Tara were close and spent a lot of time together. When Tara was about fifteen, however, Shawn began to be physically abusive toward her. His behavior only got worse after Shawn experienced a head injury. Tyler eventually realized that Shawn was hurting Tara, and he urged Tara to seriously consider applying to college and getting away from the family. Although she was uncertain at first, Tara began to study and was eventually accepted at Brigham Young University, having passed herself off as homeschooled.
In January 2004, when Tara was seventeen years old, she moved to Utah to begin her college education. She found the adjustment very difficult at first, but eventually began to excel in her studies. Tara's finances were precarious, and she had to hold multiple jobs and maintain very high grades to retain her scholarship. Her emerging independence also caused a threatening dynamic between her, Gene, and Shawn. Whenever Tara returned to Buck's Peak, her father manipulated her into working for him, while Shawn continued to physically and emotionally abuse her. Tara eventually confided to a bishop about her life, and he helped her to secure funding to finance her education. Tara's studies, and the people she met, also gradually opened her eyes to different realities and force her to realize how damaging and isolating her childhood has been. Tara eventually changed her major to studying history, and is encouraged to apply for a study abroad program at Cambridge University in England.
Tara's experience at Cambridge broadened her horizons even further, and she was encouraged to consider graduate studies. Tara still felt isolated from her peers, and ashamed of her origins. She hid most of her past even from her friends and the men she occasionally dated. She was eventually awarded a prestigious Cambridge Gates Fellowship and moved to England to pursue a Master's degree. She remained in close contact with her family and returned to Idaho regularly to visit, but her relationship with them deteriorated. Shawn was growing increasingly erratic and violent, and Tara feared for the safety of his wife and young child. By chance, she revealed to her sister Audrey that Shawn had been abusive with her, and Audrey later confided that Shawn abused her as well. Audrey blamed herself for not protecting her younger sister, and suggested that she and Tara confront their parents and Shawn about what happened to them.
By then Tara had built a happy life for herself in England, and was working on a PhD in history at Cambridge. However, the attempt to speak the truth quickly became a source of conflict in the family. Tara became more and more ostracized within her family, eventually culminating in Shawn learning that she had been telling their parents about the abuse she suffered. Realizing her family would never trust her claims, Tara became estranged from most of them, with the exception of Tyler.  The estrangement from her family prompted grief and depression for Tara, but she was finally able to heal, and successfully completed her PhD. By the end of her memoir, Tara has accepted that she may never have a relationship with her family again, but she takes pride in the independence she has established, and the life she has built for herself."

Prosper,"In Common Sense, Thomas Paine argues for American independence. His argument begins with more general, theoretical reflections about government and religion, then progresses onto the specifics of the colonial situation.
Paine begins by distinguishing between government and society. Society, according to Paine, is everything constructive and good that people join together to accomplish. Government, on the other hand, is an institution whose sole purpose is to protect us from our own vices. Government has its origins in the evil of man and is therefore a necessary evil at best. Paine says that government's sole purpose is to protect life, liberty and property, and that a government should be judged solely on the basis of the extent to which it accomplishes this goal.
Paine then considers an imagined scenario in which a small group of people has been placed on an island, and cut off from the rest of society. In time, these people develop ties with one another, and lawmaking becomes inevitable. Paine says the people will be much happier if they are responsible for the creation of the laws that rule them. Paine is also implicitly arguing that such a system of representation is also better for the American colonists. Having expressed his disagreement with British reign in America, Paine proceeds to launch a general attack on the British system of government. Paine says the British system is too complex and rife with contradictions, and that the monarchy is granted far too much power. The British system pretends to offer a reasonable system of checks and balances, but in fact, it does not.
From here Paine moves on to discuss, in general, the notions of monarchy and hereditary succession. Man, Pain argues, was born into a state of equality, and the distinction that has arisen between king and subject is an unnatural one. At first, Paine says, the world was without kings, but the ancient Jews decided they wanted a king. This angered God, but he allowed them to have one. Paine presents pages of biblical evidence detailing God's wrath at the idea of the Jews having a king. The conclusion Paine reaches is that the practice of monarchy originates from sin, and is an institution that the Bible and God condemn. Paine calls hereditary succession an abominable practice. He says that even if people were to choose to have a king, that does not legitimize that King's child acting as a future ruler. Furthermore, hereditary succession has brought with it innumerable evils, such as incompetent kings, corruption, and civil war.
Having dispensed with the preliminary theoretical issues, Paine sets in to discuss the details of the American situation. In response to the argument that America has flourished under British rule, and therefore ought to stay under the king, Paine says that such an argument fails to realize that America has evolved and no longer needs Britain's help. Some say that Britain has protected America, and therefore deserves allegiance, but Paine responds that Britain has only watched over America in order to secure its own economic well-being. Paine adds that most recently, instead of watching over the colonies, the British have been attacking them, and are therefore undeserving of American loyalty.
Paine says that the colonies have little to gain from remaining attached to Britain. Commerce can be better conducted with the rest of Europe, but only after America becomes independent. Paine also asserts that if the colonies remain attached to Britain, the same problems that have arisen in the past will arise in the future. Paine argues that it is necessary to seek independence now, as to do otherwise would only briefly cover up problems that will surely reemerge.
Paine even proposes the form of government that the independent colonies should adopt. His recommendation is for a representative democracy that gives roughly equal weight to each of the colonies.
Paine explains why the current time is a good time to break free of Britain. Primarily, Paine focuses on the present size of the colonies, and on their current capabilities. He presents an inventory of the British Navy and gives calculations revealing how America could build a navy of comparable size. Paine recommends this as a way of ensuring America's security and prosperity in trade. Paine also argues that America is sufficiently small as to be united now. If time were to elapse, and the population of the colonies to grow, the same feeling of unity would not be present. Paine adds that if the Americans revolt now, they can use the vast expanses of uncharted land to the West in order to pay down some of the debt they will incur.
Paine says that as a colony of Britain, America lacks respectability on the international scene. They are seen simply as rebels, and cannot form substantial alliances with other nations. In order to prosper in the long term, the colonies need to be independent. Paine says that, by declaring independence, America will be able to ask for the help of other countries in its struggle for freedom. For all of these reasons, Paine says it is imperative and urgent that the colonies declare independence."
Distinguished,"Scout Finch lives with her brother, Jem, and their widowed father, Atticus, in the sleepy Alabama town of Maycomb. Maycomb is suffering through the Great Depression, but Atticus is a prominent lawyer and the Finch family is reasonably well off in comparison to the rest of society. One summer, Jem and Scout befriend a boy named Dill, who has come to live in their neighborhood for the summer, and the trio acts out stories together. Eventually, Dill becomes fascinated with the spooky house on their street called the Radley Place. The house is owned by Mr. Nathan Radley, whose brother, Arthur (nicknamed Boo), has lived there for years without venturing outside.
Scout goes to school for the first time that fall and detests it. She and Jem find gifts apparently left for them in a knothole of a tree on the Radley property. Dill returns the following summer, and he, Scout, and Jem begin to act out the story of Boo Radley. Atticus puts a stop to their antics, urging the children to try to see life from another person’s perspective before making judgments. But, on Dill’s last night in Maycomb for the summer, the three sneak onto the Radley property, where Nathan Radley shoots at them. Jem loses his pants in the ensuing escape. When he returns for them, he finds them mended and hung over the fence.
The next winter, Jem and Scout find more presents in the tree, presumably left by the mysterious Boo. Nathan Radley eventually plugs the knothole with cement. Shortly thereafter, a fire breaks out in another neighbor’s house, and during the fire someone slips a blanket on Scout’s shoulders as she watches the blaze. Convinced that Boo did it, Jem tells Atticus about the mended pants and the presents.
To the consternation of Maycomb’s racist white community, Atticus agrees to defend a Black man named Tom Robinson, who has been accused of raping a white woman. Because of Atticus’s decision, Jem and Scout are subjected to abuse from other children, even when they celebrate Christmas at the family compound on Finch’s Landing. Calpurnia, the Finches’ Black cook, takes them to the local Black church, where the warm and close-knit community largely embraces the children.
Atticus’s sister, Alexandra, comes to live with the Finches the next summer. Dill, who is supposed to live with his “new father” in another town, runs away and comes to Maycomb. Tom Robinson’s trial begins, and when the accused man is placed in the local jail, a mob gathers to lynch him. Atticus faces the mob down the night before the trial. Jem and Scout, who have sneaked out of the house, soon join him. Scout recognizes one of the men, and her polite questioning about his son shames him into dispersing the mob.
At the trial itself, the children sit in the “colored balcony” with the town’s Black citizens. Atticus provides clear evidence that the accusers, Mayella Ewell and her father, Bob, are lying: in fact, Mayella propositioned Tom Robinson, was caught by her father, and then accused Tom of rape to cover her shame and guilt. Atticus provides impressive evidence that the marks on Mayella’s face are from wounds that her father inflicted; upon discovering her with Tom, he called her a whore and beat her. Yet, despite the significant evidence pointing to Tom’s innocence, the all-white jury convicts him. The innocent Tom later tries to escape from prison and is shot to death. In the aftermath of the trial, Jem’s faith in justice is badly shaken, and he lapses into despondency and doubt.
Despite the verdict, Bob Ewell feels that Atticus and the judge have made a fool out of him, and he vows revenge. He menaces Tom Robinson’s widow, tries to break into the judge’s house, and finally attacks Jem and Scout as they walk home from a Halloween party. Boo Radley intervenes, however, saving the children and stabbing Ewell fatally during the struggle. Boo carries the wounded Jem back to Atticus’s house, where the sheriff, in order to protect Boo, insists that Ewell tripped over a tree root and fell on his own knife. After sitting with Scout for a while, Boo disappears once more into the Radley house.  
Later, Scout feels as though she can finally imagine what life is like for Boo. He has become a human being to her at last. With this realization, Scout embraces her father’s advice to practice sympathy and understanding and demonstrates that her experiences with hatred and prejudice will not sully her faith in human goodness."
Unity,"Siddhartha, the handsome and respected son of a Brahmin, lives with his father in ancient India. Everyone in the village expects Siddhartha to be a successful Brahmin like his father. Siddhartha enjoys a near-idyllic existence with his best friend, Govinda, but he is secretly dissatisfied. He performs all the rituals of religion, and he does what religion says should bring him happiness and peace. Nonetheless, he feels something is missing. His father and the other elders have still not achieved enlightenment, and he feels that staying with them will not settle the questions he has about the nature of his existence. Siddhartha believes his father has already passed on all the wisdom their community has to offer, but he longs for something more. 
One day, a group of wandering ascetics called Samanas passes through town. They are starved and almost naked and have come to beg for food. They believe enlightenment can be reached through asceticism, a rejection of the body and physical desire. The path the Samanas preach is quite different from the one Siddhartha has been taught, and he believes it may provide some of the answers he is looking for. He decides to follow this new path. Siddhartha’s father does not want him to join the Samanas, but he cannot dissuade Siddhartha. Govinda also wants to find a path to enlightenment, and he joins Siddhartha in this new life.
	Siddhartha adjusts quickly to the ways of the Samanas because of the patience and discipline he learned in the Brahmin tradition. He learns how to free himself from the traditional trappings of life, and so loses his desire for property, clothing, sexuality, and all sustenance except that required to live. His goal is to find enlightenment by eliminating his Self, and he successfully renounces the pleasures of the world. 
Sunburned and half-starved, Siddhartha soon ceases to resemble the boy he used to be. Govinda is quick to praise the Samanas and notes the considerable moral and spiritual improvements they both have achieved since joining. Siddhartha, however, is still dissatisfied. The path of self-denial does not provide a permanent solution for him. He points out that the oldest Samanas have lived the life for many years but have yet to attain true spiritual enlightenment. The Samanas have been as unsuccessful as the Brahmins Siddhartha and Govinda left behind. At this time, Siddhartha and the other Samanas begin to hear about a new holy man named Gotama the Buddha who has attained the total spiritual enlightenment called Nirvana. Govinda convinces Siddhartha they both should leave the Samanas and seek out Gotama. Siddhartha and Govinda inform the leader of the Samanas of their decision to leave. The leader is clearly displeased, but Siddhartha silences him with an almost magical, hypnotizing gaze. 
Siddhartha and Govinda find Gotama’s camp of followers and are taken in. Siddhartha is initially pleased with Gotama, and he and Govinda are instructed in the Eightfold Path, the four main points, and other aspects of Buddhism. However, while Govinda is convinced to join Gotama and his followers, Siddhartha still has doubts. He has noticed a contradiction in Gotama’s teachings: Siddhartha questions how one can embrace the unity of all things, as the Buddha asks, if they are also being told to overcome the physical world. Siddhartha realizes Buddhism will not give him the answers he needs. Sadly, he leaves Govinda behind and begins a search for the meaning of life, the achievement of which he feels will not be dependent on religious instruction. 
	Siddhartha decides to embark on a life free from meditation and the spiritual quests he has been pursuing, and to instead learn from the pleasures of the body and the material world. In his new wanderings, Siddhartha meets a friendly ferryman, fully content with his simple life. Siddhartha crosses the ferryman’s river and comes to a city. Here, a beautiful courtesan named Kamala entrances him. He knows she would be the best one to teach him about the world of love, but Kamala will not have him unless he proves he can fit into the material world. She convinces him to take up the path of the merchant. With her help, Siddhartha soon finds employment with a merchant named Kamaswami and begins to learn the trade. While Siddhartha learns the wisdom of the business world and begins to master the skills Kamaswami teaches him, Kamala becomes his lover and teaches him what she knows about love.
	Years pass, and Siddhartha’s business acumen increases. Soon, he is a rich man and enjoys the benefits of an affluent life. He gambles, drinks, and dances, and anything that can be bought in the material world is his for the taking. Siddhartha is detached from this life, however, and he can never see it as more than a game. He doesn’t care if he wins or loses this game because it doesn’t touch his spirit in any lasting way. The more he obtains in the material world, the less it satisfies him, and he is soon caught in a cycle of unhappiness that he tries to escape by engaging in even more gambling, drinking, and sex. When he is at his most disillusioned, he dreams that Kamala’s rare songbird is dead in its cage. He understands that the material world is slowly killing him without providing him with the enlightenment for which he has been searching. One night, he resolves to leave it all behind and departs without notifying either Kamala or Kamaswami. 
Sick at heart, Siddhartha wanders until he finds a river. He considers drowning himself, but he instead falls asleep on the riverbank. While he is sleeping, Govinda, who is now a Buddhist monk, passes by. Not recognizing Siddhartha, he watches over the sleeping man to protect him from snakes. Siddhartha immediately recognizes Govinda when he wakes up, but Govinda notes that Siddhartha has changed significantly from his days with the Samanas and now appears to be a rich man. Siddhartha responds that he is currently neither a Samana nor a rich man. Siddhartha wishes to become someone new. Govinda soon leaves to continue on his journey, and Siddhartha sits by the river and considers where his life has taken him. 
	Siddhartha seeks out the same content ferryman he met years before. The ferryman, who introduces himself as Vasudeva, radiates an inner peace that Siddhartha wishes to attain. Vasudeva says he himself has attained this sense of peace through many years of studying the river. Siddhartha expresses a desire to likewise learn from the river, and Vasudeva agrees to let Siddhartha live and work beside him. Siddhartha studies the river and begins to take from it a spiritual enlightenment unlike any he has ever known. While sitting by the river, he contemplates the unity of all life, and in the river’s voice he hears the word Om. 

	One day Kamala the courtesan approaches the ferry along with her son on a pilgrimage to visit Gotama, who is said to be dying. Before they can cross, a snake bites Kamala. Siddhartha and Vasudeva tend to Kamala, but the bite kills her. Before she dies, she tells Siddhartha that he is the father of her eleven-year-old son. Siddhartha does his best to console and provide for his son, but the boy is spoiled and cynical. Siddhartha’s son dislikes life with the two ferrymen and wishes to return to his familiar city and wealth. Vasudeva believes Siddhartha’s son should be allowed to leave if he wants to, but Siddhartha is not ready to let him go. One morning, Siddhartha awakens to find his son has run away and stolen all of his and Vasudeva’s money. Siddhartha chases after the boy, but as he reaches the city he realizes the chase is futile. Vasudeva follows Siddhartha and brings him back to their home by the river, instructing him to soothe the pain of losing his son by listening to the river.
	Siddhartha studies the river for many years, and Vasudeva teaches Siddhartha how to learn the many secrets the river has to tell. In contemplating the river, Siddhartha has a revelation: Just as the water of the river flows into the ocean and is returned by rain, all forms of life are interconnected in a cycle without beginning or end. Birth and death are all part of a timeless unity. Life and death, joy and sorrow, good and evil are all parts of the whole and are necessary to understand the meaning of life. By the time Siddhartha has learned all the river’s lessons, Vasudeva announces that he is through with his life at the river. He retires into the forest, leaving Siddhartha to be the ferryman.
	The novel ends with Govinda returning to the river to seek enlightenment by meeting with a wise man who lives there. When Govinda arrives, he does not recognize that the wise man is Siddhartha himself. Govinda is still a follower of Gotama but has yet to attain the kind of enlightenment that Siddhartha now radiates, and he asks Siddhartha to teach him what he knows. Siddhartha explains that neither he nor anyone can teach the wisdom to Govinda, because verbal explanations are limited and can never communicate the entirety of enlightenment. Instead, he asks Govinda to kiss him on the forehead, and when Govinda does, the vision of unity that Siddhartha has experienced is communicated instantly to Govinda. Govinda and Siddhartha have both finally achieved the enlightenment they set out to find in the days of their youth."
West,"Saeed and Nadia are young adults living in an unnamed city on the brink of war. Saeed asks Nadia to coffee, and they begin to date. However, between societal rules restricting men and women being in public together and escalating tension between the government and a militant group, they rarely get to see each other. Because Saeed lives with his parents, he sometimes goes to Nadia’s flat, disguising himself as a woman to not cause a scandal. Otherwise, they text frequently. Then, the government cuts off all cellular and Wi-Fi service as a counterterrorism measure, which also cuts Saeed and Nadia off from each other. Saeed searches everywhere for Nadia and finally waits all day at her flat for her to return. He begs her to move in with him and his parents, but Nadia is reluctant. When Saeed’s mother gets killed by stray gunfire, Nadia relents and moves in with Saeed and his father. As the fighting worsens, Saeed and Nadia hear rumors about magical doors that can transport people anywhere in the world. They don’t believe these rumors. 
The militants eventually take the city, imposing strict rules and surveillance. They hold public executions of those who break their religious rules and those who belong to certain religious denominations. Desperate to escape, Saeed and Nadia meet with a man who agrees to secure them passage out of the city via a magical door. He takes their money and agrees to get in contact. When they hear from him again, Saeed’s father announces he will not go with them. He makes Nadia promise to stay with Saeed until Saeed is safe and settled. The next day, Saeed and Nadia pack small backpacks full of supplies and meet the mysterious man at the rendezvous point. He sends them through a door. They emerge on the island of Mykonos, where a large refugee camp has grown. Wealthy countries have also discovered these doors and keep them strictly guarded to try and cut back on the number of refugees in their countries. After a few months, Nadia befriends a local girl who promises to help them leave Mykonos. The girl makes good on her promise and sneaks Saeed and Nadia through a newly discovered door.
They emerge in an empty mansion in London and stay in one of the rooms. Other refugees come to live in the house alongside them. Saeed and Nadia start to feel less in love and become more irritated with each other because of the stress of their ordeal. Some London citizens attack refugees, but others volunteer to bring food and medicine into the occupied houses. The British government cuts the power to the neighborhood. As more refugees enter London, they divide themselves by national origin. Saeed would like to move to another house to be closer to others from their country, but Nadia prefers to stay where they are. Eventually, the British government begins a push to make the migrants leave the houses they’ve occupied. There is a violent siege, but the government finally relents. The government plans to build a halo city on London’s outskirts for the migrants to live in. Saeed and Nadia move to a work camp and build houses so that they can someday earn a forty-meter house of their own. Between exhaustion and their fizzling romance, they fall into a rut. Nadia suggests they move to Marin in California. 
Nadia and Saeed set up a shanty house in Marin. Nadia starts working at a co-op, and Saeed finds solace in a Black-majority religious congregation. Even though they both settle into their new lives, they find themselves changing. Nadia begins to realize that she’s bisexual, and Saeed becomes attracted to the daughter of the preacher at his congregation. Although they still enjoy each other’s company, they begin to feel more like friends than lovers. They don’t want their relationship to sour, and they know they have to separate. One day, Nadia simply packs her things and leaves. She moves into a room at the co-op where she works and later starts dating one of her coworkers. Saeed grows closer to the preacher’s daughter, and they start dating. Although their separation is difficult at first, Saeed and Nadia eventually fall out of touch. Fifty years later, they meet again in a café in the city they once fled from together. Saeed talks about the stars in the Chilean desert and offers to take Nadia someday. They leave not knowing if they’ll ever see each other again."
Resumption,"Arnold Spirit Jr. (“Junior”) tells about his early life on the Spokane reservation. How doctors predicted he would die from complications of hydrocephalus—his being born with excess spinal fluid on the brain. But, of course, Junior survived. The early condition, however, left Junior with a lisp and stutter. He had too many teeth and had to have some removed, and he is far-sighted in one eye and near-sighted in the other. Worst of all, as a small child he had seizures. Even today, other Native Americans on the reservation or, as Junior calls it, the “rez,” bully him and call him names like “hydrohead.” Junior’s best friend, Rowdy, often promises to protect him, but Rowdy’s own violent tendencies sometimes prevent him from being all that helpful. Junior’s parents are alcoholics and his sister, Mary, spends all her time in the family basement. Junior loves drawing cartoons, and many of his drawings are included in the book. Rowdy is extremely supportive of Junior’s art, and Junior thinks this proves his and Rowdy’s friendship.
In the summer before their freshman year of high school, Rowdy convinces Junior to go with him to the Spokane powwow. Junior is fourteen. Rowdy promises to protect Junior from any bullies, but, soon after they arrive, Rowdy trips into a van, embarrassing himself. Rowdy takes out his anger by attacking the van with a shovel, but the vandalism scares Junior. Junior runs away into a set of mean, drunk, thirty-year-old triplets. They push him around and beat him up. Later, to make up for having let Junior down, Rowdy sneaks into the triplets’ camp at night and cuts off their long braids, emasculating them. Junior sees it as more proof that Rowdy does the best he can. Soon thereafter, Junior and Rowdy begin their first year at Wellpinit High. Junior is excited to get started and is especially looking forward to his geometry class. But his geometry teacher, Mr. P, gives Junior a textbook that Junior sees was signed by his mother, Agnes Adams, thirty years previously. He throws the textbook in a fit of rage. It hits Mr. P in the face, breaking his nose.
After the textbook incident, Junior is suspended from school. Much to Junior’s surprise, Mr. P comes to Junior’s house to apologize to Junior. Mr. P tells Junior that there is no hope on the reservation, and that the best thing Junior can do for himself is to get off the reservation as quickly as possible. Mr. P says that Junior is smart, but that Mary was even smarter and more talented than Junior until the reservation crushed her spirit. Junior takes Mr. P advice, and, when his parents come home, he tells them he’s decided to go to school in the all-white town of Reardan, some twenty-two miles from home. Junior’s parents agree, and he starts school the next day. Because his family is very poor, sometimes without any money for gas, Junior often has difficulty getting to Reardan. He hitchhikes or gets rides from people like his dad’s friend, Eugene. On his first day, Junior meets his future girlfriend, Penelope. A few days later, the toughest jock, Roger, insults Junior with a racist joke, and Junior punches him in the face. Junior is surprised to find that his action earns him Roger’s respect. Then, Junior’s future friend, Gordy, sticks up for Junior in class.
On the reservation, however, Rowdy and the other Native Americans feel betrayed. Most react by ignoring Junior, but some are angrier than that. To impress Penelope, Junior decides to raise money for the homeless while trick-or-treating. But, after Junior starts going door-to-door, word gets around that he is carrying money. Junior gets jumped by three boys in masks. Junior fears that Rowdy is one of them. Penelope finds out and donates money in both her and Junior’s names. Then, around Thanksgiving, Mary gets married to a Montana poker player she meets at the Spokane casino, and she moves with him to Montana without saying goodbye to her family. Junior wonders if Mary is competing with him because he managed to get off the reservation. Junior hears from Mary occasionally thereafter by email and letter. In her messages, Mary says she is struggling to find a job, but she remains optimistic.
Later that fall, Junior tries out for the Reardan basketball team and has to play one-on-one against Roger, who is 6’6” and can dunk. It’s a tough match up, but Junior holds his own and is rewarded with a spot on the varsity team. Junior’s team plays an early game against Wellpinit on the reservation where the entire crowd turns its back on Junior when his team enters the gym. While Junior is checking into the game for the first time, a fan throws a quarter at him, hitting him in the head. Junior asks Eugene, an EMT, to stich him up in the locker room, but, just after he checks back into the game, Rowdy fouls Junior so badly he gives Junior a concussion. Reardan loses badly, but, weeks later, in the teams’ next match up at Reardan, Junior’s strong defense leads Reardan to decisive victory. Wellpinit’s season is ruined, and Reardan loses, later, early in the state playoffs.
Then the tragedies begin. Junior’s grandmother, whom Junior admires for her tolerance and generosity, is struck and killed by a drunk driver as she is walking home from a powwow. A white billionaire named Ted makes a pompous speech at her well-attended funeral, and the Native Americans laugh him off the reservation. Then, Eugene’s friend, Bobby, shoots Eugene in the face over the last sip of a bottle of wine. Later, just when Junior thinks things can’t get any worse, the school guidance counselor calls him into the hall to tell him that Mary has died. Junior’s dad picks him up from school and tells him that Mary and her husband’s trailer caught on fire while the two were passed out from excess drinking. Rowdy blames Junior for Mary’s death, but Junior somehow manages to finish the school year and get a decent report card. He and his family begin to heal, and he promises his Mom that he will never drink. That summer, Rowdy comes to Junior’s house to see if Junior will hang out. The book ends with the two playing a game of one-on-one in the summer heat."
Dramatically,"Euripedes' Medea opens in a state of conflict. Jason has abandoned his wife, Medea, along with their two children. He hopes to advance his station by remarrying with Glauce, the daughter of Creon, king of Corinth, the Greek city where the play is set. All the events of play proceed out of this initial dilemma, and the involved parties become its central characters.
Outside the royal palace, a nurse laments the events that have lead to the present crisis. After a long series of trials and adventures, which ultimately forced Jason and Medea to seek exile in Corinth, the pair had settled down and established their family, achieving a degree of fame and respectability. Jason's recent abandonment of that family has crushed Medea emotionally, to the degree that she curses her own existence, as well as that of her two children.
Fearing a possible plot of revenge, Creon banishes Medea and her children from the city. After pleading for mercy, Medea is granted one day before she must leave, during which she plans to complete her quest for ""justice""--at this stage in her thinking, the murder of Creon, Glauce, and Jason. Jason accuses Medea of overreacting. By voicing her grievances so publicly, she has endangered her life and that of their children. He claims that his decision to remarry was in everyone's best interest. Medea finds him spineless, and she refuses to accept his token offers of help.
Appearing by chance in Corinth, Aegeus, King of Athens, offers Medea sanctuary in his home city in exchange for her knowledge of certain drugs that can cure his sterility. Now guaranteed an eventual haven in Athens, Medea has cleared all obstacles to completing her revenge, a plan which grows to include the murder of her own children; the pain their loss will cause her does not outweigh the satisfaction she will feel in making Jason suffer.
For the balance of the play, Medea engages in a ruse; she pretends to sympathize with Jason (bringing him into her confidence) and offers his wife ""gifts,"" a coronet and dress. Ostensibly, the gifts are meant to convince Glauce to ask her father to allow the children to stay in Corinth. The coronet and dress are actually poisoned, however, and their delivery causes Glauce's death. Seeing his daughter ravaged by the poison, Creon chooses to die by her side by dramatically embracing her and absorbing the poison himself.
A messenger recounts the gruesome details of these deaths, which Medea absorbs with cool attentiveness. Her earlier state of anxiety, which intensified as she struggled with the decision to commit infanticide, has now given way to an assured determination to fulfill her plans. Against the protests of the chorus, Medea murders her children and flees the scene in a dragon-pulled chariot provided by her grandfather, the Sun-God. Jason is left cursing his lot; his hope of advancing his station by abandoning Medea and marrying Glauce, the conflict which opened the play, has been annihilated, and everything he values has been lost through the deaths that conclude the tragedy."
Disorders,"Lawyer Bryan Stevenson gives a first-person account of his decades helping marginalized Americans who have been unfairly and harshly punished by the U.S. criminal justice system, which disproportionately targets people of color and poor people. At the heart of Just Mercy is the story of Walter McMillian, a Black man who was framed for the murder of a girl named Ronda Morrison, convicted, and sent to death row. 
Stevenson alternates chapters about Walter with his personal reflections on our country’s history with racial disparity and issues around incarceration. Stevenson highlights other groups of vulnerable people who have been victimized by the criminal justice system and shares the stories of the prisoners he has helped over the years. The book also follows the growth of Stevenson’s nonprofit law project, the Alabama-based Equal Justice Initiative (EJI), through its expansion from focusing on death row prisoners to helping people sentenced to life without parole. Stevenson chronicles how EJI becomes a significant force in criminal justice reform.
In 1983 as a law student, Stevenson discovers his life’s passion when he interns with the Georgia-based Southern Prisoners Defense Committee and meets his first death row prisoner. After graduation Stevenson accepts a job with the organization to represent poor prisoners, including those in Alabama who lack any public defender. He meets Walter McMillian on Alabama’s death row. Walter owns a successful business but also transgresses racial boundaries when he has an affair with a white woman. Soon after the affair becomes public, the woman’s friend, Ralph Myers, accuses Walter of committing the unsolved murder of Ronda Morrison, which has outraged the community. Law enforcement, including a racist sheriff and the district attorney, eagerly pounces on this accusation, overlooking Walter’s alibi and a lack of evidence. Instead, they actively force Ralph to stick with his story even when he tries to recant. They coerce other false witness testimonies, and—as revealed years later—actively suppress evidence.
After Stevenson and the team at EJI unsuccessfully appeal Walter’s conviction, they launch their own investigation of the crime and uncover new evidence. They find witnesses who can prove the witnesses against Walter lied as well as financial records that indicate that one of these witnesses was paid to give false testimony. Stevenson and his team also petition for and receive all records from Walter’s trial. However, their big break comes when they receive a phone call from Ralph, who now wants to make amends. Ralph admits to lying about Walter and says he was threatened by law enforcement. Stevenson wins a hearing for Walter where he can present his new evidence: Ralph’s testimony, which is confirmed by health care workers and other inmates, as well as recordings of the law enforcement team threatening Ralph if he doesn’t frame Walter. 
While the judge refuses to grant Walter relief, Stevenson continues the appeal process through the Alabama courts. The district attorney asks outside agents to investigate the murder for which Walter was convicted, and the investigators determine that Walter had nothing to do with the crime. Six weeks later, the court invalidates Walter’s conviction. Stevenson and the State file a joint motion to dismiss the charges, and Walter is set free.
Throughout the process, Stevenson and Walter become close friends, and Stevenson helps Walter upon his release, including filing a civil suit on his behalf and offering him a place to stay. Walter works with Stevenson to share his story, giving interviews and speaking at legal conferences, and Walter is even featured in a documentary. Unfortunately, Walter is diagnosed with advancing dementia and is forced to rely on family and eventually a nursing facility for his care. He dies in 2013. Stevenson gives a eulogy at his funeral and shares all he learned from Walter, particularly that we must extend mercy to everyone, even those who have not earned it.
Interspersed with chapters chronicling Walter’s narrative are stories of Stevenson’s other clients and work. His closeness with these prisoners and their horrifying circumstances makes Stevenson more determined to help and causes him to reflect on abstract issues that nevertheless imbue the criminal justice system, like humanity and mercy. Stevenson focuses on several categories of vulnerable people who become trapped in the system, including mentally ill prisoners, disabled prisoners, and poor women who give birth to stillborn babies. 
Stevenson and his team at EJI also become increasingly focused on juvenile offenders who are sometimes tried as adults despite their young age. These offenders may be given de facto death sentences by being sentenced to life without parole and face perilous circumstances when they are housed in adult prisons. Stevenson illustrates how these prisoners retain their own humanity while being forced to live under inhumane conditions. He also discusses some of the qualities common among these types of prisoners: They are generally poor and disproportionately people of color, and most of them lack adequate legal counsel. The juveniles have horrific backgrounds of abuse and neglect.
Stevenson and his team at EJI also work to change the legal system to offer more protection to marginalized people. Several of his cases end up before the U.S. Supreme Court, and he succeeds in winning rulings that ban as unconstitutional the conviction of children to life without parole and the execution of people deemed incompetent from dementia or neurological disease. EJI works to raise public awareness of issues surrounding unfair incarceration, produces groundbreaking reports on racial issues, and sets up programs to help formerly incarcerated people adjust to life on the outside.
Stevenson also reflects on the issues that surround the criminal justice system. His time spent with prisoners awaiting their execution makes him realize how inhumane it is to prepare another human to die. After decades of work, when Stevenson fails to prevent the execution of a man who suffers from an intellectual disability, he momentarily feels unable to continue his work. However, he realizes that he cannot help but be broken by his experiences and comes to understand that it is his own brokenness that allows him to more fully understand the need for mercy and to bring compassion to others. The book ends with Stevenson’s renewed commitment to helping others."
Emigrating,"A Raisin in the Sun portrays a few weeks in the life of the Youngers, a Black family living on the South Side of Chicago in the 1950s. When the play opens, the Youngers are about to receive an insurance check for $10,000. This money comes from the deceased Mr. Younger’s life insurance policy. Each of the adult members of the family has an idea as to what he or she would like to do with this money. The matriarch of the family, Mama, wants to buy a house to fulfill a dream she shared with her husband. Mama’s son, Walter Lee, would rather use the money to invest in a liquor store with his friends. He believes that the investment will solve the family’s financial problems forever. Walter’s wife, Ruth, agrees with Mama, however, and hopes that she and Walter can provide more space and opportunity for their son, Travis. Finally, Beneatha, Walter’s sister and Mama’s daughter, wants to use the money for her medical school tuition. She also wishes that her family members were not so interested in assimilating into the white world. Beneatha instead tries to find her identity by looking back to the past and to Africa.
As the play progresses, the Youngers clash over their competing dreams. Ruth discovers that she is pregnant but fears that if she has the child, she will put more financial pressure on her family members. When Walter says nothing to Ruth’s admission that she is considering abortion, Mama puts a down payment on a house for the whole family. She believes that a bigger, brighter dwelling will help them all. This house is in Clybourne Park, an entirely white neighborhood. When the Youngers’ future neighbors find out that the Youngers are moving in, they send Mr. Lindner, from the Clybourne Park Improvement Association, to offer the Youngers money in return for staying away. The Youngers refuse the deal, even after Walter loses the rest of the money ($6,500) to his friend Willy Harris, who persuades Walter to invest in the liquor store and then runs off with his cash.
In the meantime, Beneatha rejects her suitor, George Murchison, whom she believes to be shallow and blind to the problems of race. Subsequently, she receives a marriage proposal from her Nigerian boyfriend, Joseph Asagai, who wants Beneatha to get a medical degree and move to Africa with him (Beneatha does not make her choice before the end of the play). The Youngers eventually move out of the apartment, fulfilling the family’s long-held dream. Their future seems uncertain and slightly dangerous, but they are optimistic and determined to live a better life. They believe that they can succeed if they stick together as a family and resolve to defer their dreams no longer."
Swollen,"Beloved begins in 1873 in Cincinnati, Ohio, where Sethe, a former slave, has been living with her eighteen-year-old daughter Denver. Sethe’s mother-in-law, Baby Suggs, lived with them until her death eight years earlier. Just before Baby Suggs’s death, Sethe’s two sons, Howard and Buglar, ran away. Sethe believes they fled because of the malevolent presence of an abusive ghost that has haunted their house at 124 Bluestone Road for years. Denver, however, likes the ghost, which everyone believes to be the spirit of her dead sister.
On the day the novel begins, Paul D, whom Sethe has not seen since they worked together on Mr. Garner’s Sweet Home plantation in Kentucky approximately twenty years earlier, stops by Sethe’s house. His presence resurrects memories that have lain buried in Sethe’s mind for almost two decades. From this point on, the story will unfold on two temporal planes. The present in Cincinnati constitutes one plane, while a series of events that took place around twenty years earlier, mostly in Kentucky, constitutes the other. This latter plane is accessed and described through the fragmented flashbacks of the major characters. Accordingly, we frequently read these flashbacks several times, sometimes from varying perspectives, with each successive narration of an event adding a little more information to the previous ones.
From these fragmented memories, the following story begins to emerge: Sethe, the protagonist, was born in the South to an African mother she never knew. When she is thirteen, she is sold to the Garners, who own Sweet Home and practice a comparatively benevolent kind of slavery. There, the other slaves, who are all men, lust after her but never touch her. Their names are Sixo, Paul D, Paul A, Paul F, and Halle. Sethe chooses to marry Halle, apparently in part because he has proven generous enough to buy his mother’s freedom by hiring himself out on the weekends. Together, Sethe and Halle have two sons, Howard and Buglar, as well as a baby daughter whose name we never learn. When she leaves Sweet Home, Sethe is also pregnant with a fourth child. After the eventual death of the proprietor, Mr. Garner, the widowed Mrs. Garner asks her sadistic, vehemently racist brother-in-law to help her run the farm. He is known to the slaves as schoolteacher, and his oppressive presence makes life on the plantation even more unbearable than it had been before. The slaves decide to run.
Schoolteacher and his nephews anticipate the slaves’ escape, however, and capture Paul D and Sixo. Schoolteacher kills Sixo and brings Paul D back to Sweet Home, where Paul D sees Sethe for what he believes will be the last time. She is still intent on running, having already sent her children ahead to her mother-in-law Baby Suggs’s house in Cincinnati. Invigorated by the recent capture, schoolteacher’s nephews seize Sethe in the barn and violate her, stealing the milk her body is storing for her infant daughter. Unbeknownst to Sethe, Halle is watching the event from a loft above her, where he lies frozen with horror. Afterward, Halle goes mad: Paul D sees him sitting by a churn with butter slathered all over his face. Paul D, meanwhile, is forced to suffer the indignity of wearing an iron bit in his mouth.
When schoolteacher finds out that Sethe has reported his and his nephews’ misdeeds to Mrs. Garner, he has her whipped severely, despite the fact that she is pregnant. Swollen and scarred, Sethe nevertheless runs away, but along the way she collapses from exhaustion in a forest. A white girl, Amy Denver, finds her and nurses her back to health. When Amy later helps Sethe deliver her baby in a boat, Sethe names this second daughter Denver after the girl who helped her. Sethe receives further help from Stamp Paid, who rows her across the Ohio River to Baby Suggs’s house. Baby Suggs cleans Sethe up before allowing her to see her three older children.
Sethe spends twenty-eight wonderful days in Cincinnati, where Baby Suggs serves as an unofficial preacher to the black community. On the last day, however, schoolteacher comes for Sethe to take her and her children back to Sweet Home. Rather than surrender her children to a life of dehumanizing slavery, she flees with them to the woodshed and tries to kill them. Only the third child, her older daughter, dies, her throat having been cut with a handsaw by Sethe. Sethe later arranges for the baby’s headstone to be carved with the word “Beloved.” The sheriff takes Sethe and Denver to jail, but a group of white abolitionists, led by the Bodwins, fights for her release. Sethe returns to the house at 124, where Baby Suggs has sunk into a deep depression. The community shuns the house, and the family continues to live in isolation.
Meanwhile, Paul D has endured torturous experiences in a chain gang in Georgia, where he was sent after trying to kill Brandywine, a slave owner to whom he was sold by schoolteacher. His traumatic experiences have caused him to lock away his memories, emotions, and ability to love in the “tin tobacco box” of his heart. One day, a fortuitous rainstorm allows Paul D and the other chain gang members to escape. He travels northward by following the blossoming spring flowers. Years later, he ends up on Sethe’s porch in Cincinnati.
Paul D’s arrival at 124 commences the series of events taking place in the present time frame. Prior to moving in, Paul D chases the house’s resident ghost away, which makes the already lonely Denver resent him from the start. Sethe and Paul D look forward to a promising future together, until one day, on their way home from a carnival, they encounter a strange young woman sleeping near the steps of 124. Most of the characters believe that the woman—who calls herself Beloved—is the embodied spirit of Sethe’s dead daughter, and the novel provides a wealth of evidence supporting this interpretation. Denver develops an obsessive attachment to Beloved, and Beloved’s attachment to Sethe is equally if not more intense. Paul D and Beloved hate each other, and Beloved controls Paul D by moving him around the house like a rag doll and by seducing him against his will.
When Paul D learns the story of Sethe’s “rough choice”—her infanticide—he leaves 124 and begins sleeping in the basement of the local church. In his absence, Sethe and Beloved’s relationship becomes more intense and exclusive. Beloved grows increasingly abusive, manipulative, and parasitic, and Sethe is obsessed with satisfying Beloved’s demands and making her understand why she murdered her. Worried by the way her mother is wasting away, Denver leaves the premises of 124 for the first time in twelve years in order to seek help from Lady Jones, her former teacher. The community provides the family with food and eventually organizes under the leadership of Ella, a woman who had worked on the Underground Railroad and helped with Sethe’s escape, in order to exorcise Beloved from 124. When they arrive at Sethe’s house, they see Sethe on the porch with Beloved, who stands smiling at them, naked and pregnant. Mr. Bodwin, who has come to 124 to take Denver to her new job, arrives at the house. Mistaking him for schoolteacher, Sethe runs at Mr. Bodwin with an ice pick. She is restrained, but in the confusion Beloved disappears, never to return.
Afterward, Paul D comes back to Sethe, who has retreated to Baby Suggs’s bed to die. Mourning Beloved, Sethe laments, “She was my best thing.” But Paul D replies, “You your best thing, Sethe.” The novel then ends with a warning that “[t]his is not a story to pass on.” The town, and even the residents of 124, have forgotten Beloved “[l]ike an unpleasant dream during a troubling sleep.”"
Undisturbed,"Hoping to cause a sensation in the field of parapsychology, Dr. John Montague rents Hill House, a secluded manor with a reputation for being haunted. He carefully selects two participants for his study—Eleanor Vance, a thirty-two-year-old woman who was reported to have had experiences with a poltergeist as a child, and Theodora, a woman marked in one of his lab’s studies as having psychic abilities. A third participant, Luke Sanderson, also joins the group. Luke stands to inherit Hill House after his aunt dies, and Luke’s aunt sends him to watch over the house and deter amateur ghost hunters. She also wants to keep Luke out of trouble since he is a liar and a thief.
Eleanor arrives at Hill House first. An instinct tells her to leave, but she stays and meets the house’s caretakers, Mr. and Mrs. Dudley. They are unwelcoming and urge her to go away, saying that they refuse to stay at the house after dark. Theodora arrives next, and Eleanor, a recluse, feels immediately drawn to Theodora’s warm, witty, and open personality. Eleanor lies and tells Theodora she has an apartment back home, when she actually lives at her sister’s house, where she sleeps on a cot. Eleanor was her mother’s primary caretaker up until her mother’s death a few months prior. She is just beginning to explore her freedom and is elated to have found a new friend.
Dr. Montague and Luke arrive next. Dr. Montague reluctantly tells the group about the house’s history after dinner—he doesn’t want to scare anyone into leaving, since the last tenant to leave at night died when his horse crushed him against the oak tree in the driveway. Dr. Montague explains that the house was built eighty years ago by a man named Hugh Crain. Crain designed Hill House as a series of cloistered, maze-like concentric circles that are almost impossible to navigate. Tragically, Crain’s wife never set foot into the house; she died when her carriage overturned in the driveway. Bitter and depressed, Crain stayed to raise his two daughters in the house. Over the years, the daughters fought over ownership of the house, and the house eventually landed in the hands of the older sister’s caretaker, a young woman from town. Taunted and harassed by the younger sister and the townspeople, the young woman hanged herself, reportedly in the house’s turret.
Over the first week of their stay, the group experiences a series of unexplainable events. One night, the women hear a loud banging on the door and feel a chilling breeze. The men see a mysterious animal run down the hallway. Outside the nursery, they discover a mysterious cold spot. Inside the library, Eleanor detects an awful odor. Finally, Luke discovers the words HELP ELEANOR COME HOME written in chalk in the halls. With each event, the group grows more suspicious of Eleanor, and Eleanor is terrified by the thought that the house is singling her out.
The odd events continue. When Theodora finds the words HELP ELEANOR COME HOME ELEANOR written in blood on her walls, she lashes out at Eleanor, who she suspects is doing these things to get attention. Meanwhile, Eleanor feels herself losing grasp of her senses and at the same time becoming more connected to Theodora. At one point, Dr. Montague assures everyone that ghosts can’t cause them physical harm—only fear can do that. Still, Theodora and Eleanor continue to experience strange events that are hard to recall yet hard to deny.
Mrs. Montague, a parapsychologist, arrives at Hill House with her friend, Arthur. Belittling her husband and his lack of progress, she confidently declares that she will draw out Hill House’s spirits. Mrs. Montague believes that spirits feel lonely and want to connect, but they need to be coaxed into communicating. To accomplish this, she uses a device called a planchette. Mrs. Montague reports that a spirit named “Nell” spoke to her, saying it wanted to go home. The group, deeply disturbed, continues to watch Eleanor with suspicion while growing more fearful of the house. That night, Dr. Montague, Luke, Theodora, and Eleanor stay in a room together to keep watch. They hear terrible banging sounds on the door while Mrs. Montague and Arthur sleep in nearby rooms, undisturbed.
Eleanor realizes that she can hear any sound that occurs inside the house, no matter which room she is in. She believes that she is merging with the house and can sense things that the others can’t. Eleanor wakes up one night and goes to the library, aware that she’s not acting entirely of her own volition. She hears a voice that sounds like her mother’s and chases it throughout the house. Trying to avoid the others, who now realize that she’s roaming the house alone, Eleanor retreats back to the library and climbs a rickety iron stairway to the turret. The others gather underneath it and worry that the stairway will collapse, but Luke climbs up and ushers Eleanor back down to safety.
The next morning, the group agrees that Eleanor must leave Hill House. Eleanor cries and says she has nowhere to go, claiming that Hill House is now her home. Dr. Montague, worried for Eleanor’s sanity, says she must leave at once. Eleanor finally agrees, and the group watches as she begins to drive down the driveway. As she departs, however, Eleanor pities the group for believing that they can thwart Hill House’s desire to keep her—she believes that she belongs to the house. She accelerates toward the oak tree, and right before she crashes and dies, she wonders why she is doing this and why no one is stopping her. After Eleanor’s suicide, the group leaves Hill House. Dr. Montague later publishes his study, but his colleagues ridicule his findings."
Orient,"Hercule Poirot, private detective and retired Belgian police officer, boards the Taurus Express train to Stamboul (Istanbul). On the train there are two other passengers, Mary Debenham and Colonel Arbuthnot. The two act as if they are strangers, but Poirot observes behavior that suggests that they are not. Poirot is suspicious of the couple. The train arrives in Stamboul and Poirot checks in at the Tokatlian Hotel. As soon as Poirot arrives he receives a telegram summoning him back to London. While waiting at the hotel for the next train, Poirot bumps into an old friend, M. Bouc, head of the Wagon Lit. M. Bouc arranges a space for Poirot on the Orient Express. In the dining room of the Tokatlian Hotel, Poirot first spots Ratchett and Hector McQueen eating dinner. Poirot know that Ratchett is an evil man and he describes him to M. Bouc as an animal.
Poirot board the Orient Express. He is forced to ride in a second-class cabin because the train is unusually full. Ratchett and Hector McQueen are also aboard the train. Ratchett approaches Poirot and asks if he will work for him, Ratchett tells Poirot he has been receiving threatening letters and that someone is trying to kill him. Poirot refuses the case. M. Bouc has taken the last first class cabin, but arranges to be moved to a separate coach and gives Poirot his space in first class. The first night Poirot sleeps in first class, he observes some strange occurrences. Early in the morning, Poirot is wakened by a cry from Ratchett's compartment next to him. The wagon lit conductor responds knocks on Ratchett's door and a voice from inside responds, ""Ce n'est rien. Je me suis trompe"" (It is nothing. I am mistaken). Poirot has difficulty sleeping because there is a peculiar silence on the train. Mrs. Hubbard rings her bell and tells the conductor a man is in her room. Poirot rings his bell for water and is informed by the conductor that the train is stuck in a snow bank. Poirot hears a loud thump next door.
The next morning, the train still stopped, M. Bouc informs Poirot that Ratchett has been murdered and the murderer is still aboard the train. Poirot tells M. Bouc he will investigate the case. Poirot first examines Ratchett's body and compartment. Ratchett has twelve stab wounds. The window is left open in Ratchett's compartment, presumably to make the investigators think the murderer escaped out the window, but there are no footprints outside the window in the snow. A handkerchief with the initial ""H"" is found in the compartment, a pipe cleaner, a round match different from the matches Ratchett used and a charred piece of paper with the name ""Armstrong"" on it.
The piece of paper with the word Armstrong on it helps Poirot figure out who Ratchett really is and why someone would want to murder him. A few years back, a man named Cassetti kidnapped a three-year old girl, Daisy Armstrong. Cassetti collected a ransom from the wealthy Armstrong family, but killed the child anyways. Poirot concludes that Ratchett is Cassetti.
The interviews start with the Wagon Lit conductor, then Hector McQueen. Poirot knows that McQueen is involved with the case because he knows about the Armstrong note found in Ratchett's compartment, Hector is surprised that Poirot found the note because he thought it had been completely destroyed. He interviews Masterman and then Mrs. Hubbard. Mrs. Hubbard claims that the murderer was in her cabin. All of the passengers give Poirot suitable alibis during their interviews, although a few suspicious elements are brought to light: many passengers observed a woman in a red kimono walking down the hallway the night of the murder, but no one admits they have a red kimono. Mrs. Hubbard tells Poirot she had Greta Ohlsson lock the communicating door between she and Ratchett. Hildegarde Schmidt bumped into a stranger wearing a Wagon Lit jacket.
Poirot checks every passenger's luggage. During the check he notices a few interesting things: the label on Countess Andrenyi's luggage is wet, a Wagon Lit uniform is found in Hildegarde Schmidt's bag and, lastly, the red kimono is found in Poirot's own luggage.
After the luggage check, Poirot, Dr. Constantine and M. Bouc review the facts of the case and develop a list of questions. With the evidence and questions in mind, Poirot sits and thinks about the case. When he surfaces from a somewhat trance-like state, Poirot has discovered the solution to the case. Before he reveals this solution in full, he calls in several people and reveals their true identities. Poirot discovers Countess Andrenyi is Helena Goldenberg, aunt of Daisy Armstrong. She wet her luggage label and obscured her name, in an effort to conceal her identity. Also, Mary Debenham was Daisy's governess, Antonio Foscanelli was the Armstrong's chaffer, Masterman the valet, and Greta Ohlsson was Daisy Armstrong's nurse. Princess Dragomiroff claims her handkerchief from Poirot, the same found in Ratchett's compartment.
Poirot gathers all of the passengers into the dining car and propounds two possible solutions. The fist solution is that a stranger entered the train at Vincovci and killed Ratchett. The second solution is that all of the passengers aboard the Orient Express were involved with the murder. He argues that twelve of the thirteen passengers, all close to the Armstrong case, killed Ratchett to avenge the murder of Daisy Armstrong. Mrs. Hubbard, revealed as Linda Arden, admits that the second solution is correct. Poirot suggests that M. Bouc and Dr. Constantine tell the police that the first solution is correct to protect the family. M. Bouc and Dr. Constantine accept Poirot's suggestion."
Truly,"Arnold Spirit Jr. (“Junior”) tells about his early life on the Spokane reservation. How doctors predicted he would die from complications of hydrocephalus—his being born with excess spinal fluid on the brain. But, of course, Junior survived. The early condition, however, left Junior with a lisp and stutter. He had too many teeth and had to have some removed, and he is far-sighted in one eye and near-sighted in the other. Worst of all, as a small child he had seizures. Even today, other Native Americans on the reservation or, as Junior calls it, the “rez,” bully him and call him names like “hydrohead.” Junior’s best friend, Rowdy, often promises to protect him, but Rowdy’s own violent tendencies sometimes prevent him from being all that helpful. Junior’s parents are alcoholics and his sister, Mary, spends all her time in the family basement. Junior loves drawing cartoons, and many of his drawings are included in the book. Rowdy is extremely supportive of Junior’s art, and Junior thinks this proves his and Rowdy’s friendship.
In the summer before their freshman year of high school, Rowdy convinces Junior to go with him to the Spokane powwow. Junior is fourteen. Rowdy promises to protect Junior from any bullies, but, soon after they arrive, Rowdy trips into a van, embarrassing himself. Rowdy takes out his anger by attacking the van with a shovel, but the vandalism scares Junior. Junior runs away into a set of mean, drunk, thirty-year-old triplets. They push him around and beat him up. Later, to make up for having let Junior down, Rowdy sneaks into the triplets’ camp at night and cuts off their long braids, emasculating them. Junior sees it as more proof that Rowdy does the best he can. Soon thereafter, Junior and Rowdy begin their first year at Wellpinit High. Junior is excited to get started and is especially looking forward to his geometry class. But his geometry teacher, Mr. P, gives Junior a textbook that Junior sees was signed by his mother, Agnes Adams, thirty years previously. He throws the textbook in a fit of rage. It hits Mr. P in the face, breaking his nose.
After the textbook incident, Junior is suspended from school. Much to Junior’s surprise, Mr. P comes to Junior’s house to apologize to Junior. Mr. P tells Junior that there is no hope on the reservation, and that the best thing Junior can do for himself is to get off the reservation as quickly as possible. Mr. P says that Junior is smart, but that Mary was even smarter and more talented than Junior until the reservation crushed her spirit. Junior takes Mr. P advice, and, when his parents come home, he tells them he’s decided to go to school in the all-white town of Reardan, some twenty-two miles from home. Junior’s parents agree, and he starts school the next day. Because his family is very poor, sometimes without any money for gas, Junior often has difficulty getting to Reardan. He hitchhikes or gets rides from people like his dad’s friend, Eugene. On his first day, Junior meets his future girlfriend, Penelope. A few days later, the toughest jock, Roger, insults Junior with a racist joke, and Junior punches him in the face. Junior is surprised to find that his action earns him Roger’s respect. Then, Junior’s future friend, Gordy, sticks up for Junior in class.
On the reservation, however, Rowdy and the other Native Americans feel betrayed. Most react by ignoring Junior, but some are angrier than that. To impress Penelope, Junior decides to raise money for the homeless while trick-or-treating. But, after Junior starts going door-to-door, word gets around that he is carrying money. Junior gets jumped by three boys in masks. Junior fears that Rowdy is one of them. Penelope finds out and donates money in both her and Junior’s names. Then, around Thanksgiving, Mary gets married to a Montana poker player she meets at the Spokane casino, and she moves with him to Montana without saying goodbye to her family. Junior wonders if Mary is competing with him because he managed to get off the reservation. Junior hears from Mary occasionally thereafter by email and letter. In her messages, Mary says she is struggling to find a job, but she remains optimistic.
Later that fall, Junior tries out for the Reardan basketball team and has to play one-on-one against Roger, who is 6’6” and can dunk. It’s a tough match up, but Junior holds his own and is rewarded with a spot on the varsity team. Junior’s team plays an early game against Wellpinit on the reservation where the entire crowd turns its back on Junior when his team enters the gym. While Junior is checking into the game for the first time, a fan throws a quarter at him, hitting him in the head. Junior asks Eugene, an EMT, to stich him up in the locker room, but, just after he checks back into the game, Rowdy fouls Junior so badly he gives Junior a concussion. Reardan loses badly, but, weeks later, in the teams’ next match up at Reardan, Junior’s strong defense leads Reardan to decisive victory. Wellpinit’s season is ruined, and Reardan loses, later, early in the state playoffs.
Then the tragedies begin. Junior’s grandmother, whom Junior admires for her tolerance and generosity, is struck and killed by a drunk driver as she is walking home from a powwow. A white billionaire named Ted makes a pompous speech at her well-attended funeral, and the Native Americans laugh him off the reservation. Then, Eugene’s friend, Bobby, shoots Eugene in the face over the last sip of a bottle of wine. Later, just when Junior thinks things can’t get any worse, the school guidance counselor calls him into the hall to tell him that Mary has died. Junior’s dad picks him up from school and tells him that Mary and her husband’s trailer caught on fire while the two were passed out from excess drinking. Rowdy blames Junior for Mary’s death, but Junior somehow manages to finish the school year and get a decent report card. He and his family begin to heal, and he promises his Mom that he will never drink. That summer, Rowdy comes to Junior’s house to see if Junior will hang out. The book ends with the two playing a game of one-on-one in the summer heat."
Traveler,"A group of men, including the narrator, is listening to the Time Traveller discuss his theory that time is the fourth dimension. The Time Traveller produces a miniature time machine and makes it disappear into thin air. The next week, the guests return, to find their host stumble in, looking disheveled and tired. They sit down after dinner, and the Time Traveller begins his story.
The Time Traveller had finally finished work on his time machine, and it rocketed him into the future. When the machine stops, in the year 802,701 AD, he finds himself in a paradisiacal world of small humanoid creatures called Eloi. They are frail and peaceful, and give him fruit to eat. He explores the area, but when he returns he finds that his time machine is gone. He decides that it has been put inside the pedestal of a nearby statue. He tries to pry it open but cannot. In the night, he begins to catch glimpses of strange white ape-like creatures the Eloi call Morlocks. He decides that the Morlocks live below ground, down the wells that dot the landscape. Meanwhile, he saves one of the Eloi from drowning, and she befriends him. Her name is Weena. The Time Traveller finally works up enough courage to go down into the world of Morlocks to try to retrieve his time machine. He finds that matches are a good defense against the Morlocks, but ultimately they chase him out of their realm. Frightened by the Morlocks, he takes Weena to try to find a place where they will be safe from the Morlocks' nocturnal hunting. He goes to what he calls the Palace of Green Porcelain, which turns out to be a museum. There, he finds more matches, some camphor, and a lever he can use as a weapon. That night, retreating from the Morlocks through a giant wood, he accidentally starts a fire. Many Morlocks die in the fire and the battle that ensues, and Weena is killed. The exhausted Time Traveller returns to the pedestal to find that it has already been pried open. He strides in confidently, and just when the Morlocks think that they have trapped him, he springs onto the machine and whizzes into the future.
The Time Traveller makes several more stops. In a distant time he stops on a beach where he is attacked by giant crabs. The bloated red sun sits motionless in the sky. He then travels thirty million years into the future. The air is very thin, and the only sign of life is a black blob with tentacles. He sees a planet eclipse the sun. He then returns, exhausted, to the present time. The next day, he leaves again, but never returns."
Grim,"Max, who narrates this story in the first person, tells the reader that before he met Freak, he didn’t have a brain. This, he says, is “the unvanquished truth.”
Max first meets Freak, or Kevin, at daycare, the year that Max moves in with Grim and Gram, his mother’s parents. Freak uses crutches and calls himself “Robot Man.” One day, Freak leaves daycare and doesn’t return.
Max resumes the story in the summer before eighth grade. Grim, Max’s grandfather, worries that Max is beginning to look like Him, Max’s father. Max tells us he is L.D., learning disabled, and he doesn’t think he has much going on in his brain. One day, Max is in the backyard. He recognizes a woman moving items into a house down the block as Freak’s mom, and then sees Freak himself. Max is curious and he approaches the house. Freak asks the “earthling” (Max) to identify himself. Max runs back to his basement. He emerges later to find Freak trying to retrieve an object stuck high in a tree. Max helps him and they spend the afternoon together. Freak’s mom, who Max knows as “Fair Gwen of Air”, invites Max to dinner. Max learns that Gwen and his mom were friends years ago. 
Max and Freak go the Fourth of July fireworks show by the millpond together. Max hoists Freak onto his shoulders so that Freak can see. When the show ends, Tony D. (known as Blade) and his gang corner Max and Freak. With Freak steering Max by kicking him right or left, they run straight into the millpond, where Max becomes stuck in the mud. Blade and his followers throw rocks at them from the shore. The police arrive and rescue Max and Freak. One of the cops seems to recognize Max as the son of someone he calls “Killer Kane,” and asks if his dad is still in prison. Freak interrupts him and says, “We’re Freak the Mighty, that’s who we are.” 
Freak the Mighty spend the summer going on quests. On these quests, Freak uses words Max doesn’t understand and insists that Max look them up in the dictionary Freak always carries. Max pretends to understand.
One day, Max and Freak walk to the “Medical Research” facility where Freak says they have an Experimental Bionics Unit. Freak tells Max that he visits there every few months to be fitted for a bionic transplant. Max thinks such a procedure will be painful and dangerous, but Freak says that pain is a state of mind and life itself is dangerous.
The two boys embark on a nighttime quest to retrieve a purse that Blade and his gang tossed down a storm drain. The purse is empty except for an ID card with the address of a Loretta Lee on it. The next day, Max and Freak walk to an area of rundown apartment buildings called the Testaments. Loretta and a man named Iggy live at the address, and they both know Max’s father, Kenny Kane. Iggy says that Max is a “ringer” for his dad, Killer Kane. Loretta remembers that Freak is Gwen’s son. Iggy kicks the boys out and they run home.
The school year begins, and Max finds himself in the same class as Freak. Classmates yell slurs at him. Suddenly, Freak climbs onto Max’s shoulders and directs Max to walk around the room. “Freak the Mighty, Freak the Mighty!” he shouts. Soon the whole class is chanting. Freak the Mighty end up in the principal’s office. 
Friday the thirteenth in October comes and it’s a bad one. First, Max’s dad wants Max to write a letter to the parole board on his behalf. Max has a panic attack. Second, a medical emergency sends Freak to the hospital. His insides are growing but his outside isn’t.
As Christmas approaches, Grim tells Max that his dad is out on parole. Freak and Fair Gwen, Max, Grim and Gram spend Christmas Eve together. Freak gives Max a dictionary that he has written, filled with his favorite words. The best gift ever, Max thinks.
After the Christmas Eve festivities, Max’s father sneaks into the basement. He kidnaps Max, and they end up at Loretta and Iggy’s place. Kenny ties up Max in a vacant apartment and swears on a Bible that he did not murder Max’s mother. 
Iggy reports that Freak has sent the cops to look for them. Kenny escapes with Max to an abandoned building where he gags and ties Max up. When Kenny leaves, Loretta appears and works to free Max. No sooner is Max untied, than Kenny returns, and grabs Loretta to choke her. Max tries to stop him, yelling that he saw Kenny kill his mother. Kane lets go of Loretta and grabs Max’s neck. Seconds later, Freak appears with a squirt gun supposedly filled with sulfuric acid, which he sprays at Kenny’s eyes. Max and Freak escape, the cops arrest Kenny and save Loretta. Freak laughs because the squirt gun – filled in fact with soap, vinegar, and curry powder – worked. As Gwen arrives and carries Freak away, he yells, “Freak the Mighty strikes again!” 
The school year continues. Gwen warns Kevin that he has to be “extra careful.” He’s been having trouble breathing. Max awaits his father’s trial and is relieved when Killer Kane pleads guilty because he won’t have to testify. 
Freak, Fair Gwen, Grim, Gram, and Max celebrate Freak’s thirteenth birthday. Suddenly, Freak has a seizure and is rushed to the hospital. 
The doctors make an exception and allow Max to visit when Freak asks for him. Freak tells Max that he won’t be coming home looking the way he looks now, and that he’s having a special operation. He gives Max a gift of a blank book and tells Max to write in it, to tell the story of Freak the Mighty.
When Max arrives back at the hospital the next day, Freak has passed away. The doctor explains that his heart just got too big for his body. 
For a long time, Max does not come out of the basement. When he eventually does, he runs into Loretta Lee, who asks what he’s been doing. When he says, “Nothing,” Loretta tells him, “Nothing is a drag, kid. Think about it.” That night, Max takes out the blank book and starts writing “the unvanquished truth.” He finishes the story and feels good about having written a book. Max thinks maybe he’ll even read a book now."
Enemy,"The town in which the play is set has built a huge bathing complex that is crucial to the town's economy. Dr. Stockmann has just discovered that the baths' drainage system is seriously contaminated. He alerts several members of the community, including Hovstad and Aslaksen, and receives generous support and thanks for making his discovery in time to save the town. The next morning, however, his brother, who is also the town's mayor, tells him that he must retract his statements, for the necessary repairs would be too expensive; additionally, the mayor is not convinced by Dr. Stockmann's findings. The brothers have a fierce argument, but Dr. Stockmann hopes that at least Hovstad's newspaper will support him. However, the mayor convinces Hovstad and Aslaksen to oppose Dr. Stockmann.
The doctor holds a town meeting to give a lecture on the baths, but Aslaksen and the mayor try to keep him from speaking. Dr. Stockmann then begins a long tirade in which he condemns the foundations of the town and the tyranny of the majority. The audience finds his speech incredibly offensive, and the next morning the doctor's home is vandalized. He and his daughter are fired. The mayor insinuates that the doctor's actions were merely a scheme to inherit more of Morten Kiil's money, and Kiil himself soon arrives to suggest just such a plan to Dr. Stockmann. However, the doctor refuses all such suggestions and decides to defy authority and remain in town. His family is supportive, and he says that the strongest man is the man who stands alone."
Certain,"Lawyer Bryan Stevenson gives a first-person account of his decades helping marginalized Americans who have been unfairly and harshly punished by the U.S. criminal justice system, which disproportionately targets people of color and poor people. At the heart of Just Mercy is the story of Walter McMillian, a Black man who was framed for the murder of a girl named Ronda Morrison, convicted, and sent to death row. 
Stevenson alternates chapters about Walter with his personal reflections on our country’s history with racial disparity and issues around incarceration. Stevenson highlights other groups of vulnerable people who have been victimized by the criminal justice system and shares the stories of the prisoners he has helped over the years. The book also follows the growth of Stevenson’s nonprofit law project, the Alabama-based Equal Justice Initiative (EJI), through its expansion from focusing on death row prisoners to helping people sentenced to life without parole. Stevenson chronicles how EJI becomes a significant force in criminal justice reform.
In 1983 as a law student, Stevenson discovers his life’s passion when he interns with the Georgia-based Southern Prisoners Defense Committee and meets his first death row prisoner. After graduation Stevenson accepts a job with the organization to represent poor prisoners, including those in Alabama who lack any public defender. He meets Walter McMillian on Alabama’s death row. Walter owns a successful business but also transgresses racial boundaries when he has an affair with a white woman. Soon after the affair becomes public, the woman’s friend, Ralph Myers, accuses Walter of committing the unsolved murder of Ronda Morrison, which has outraged the community. Law enforcement, including a racist sheriff and the district attorney, eagerly pounces on this accusation, overlooking Walter’s alibi and a lack of evidence. Instead, they actively force Ralph to stick with his story even when he tries to recant. They coerce other false witness testimonies, and—as revealed years later—actively suppress evidence.
After Stevenson and the team at EJI unsuccessfully appeal Walter’s conviction, they launch their own investigation of the crime and uncover new evidence. They find witnesses who can prove the witnesses against Walter lied as well as financial records that indicate that one of these witnesses was paid to give false testimony. Stevenson and his team also petition for and receive all records from Walter’s trial. However, their big break comes when they receive a phone call from Ralph, who now wants to make amends. Ralph admits to lying about Walter and says he was threatened by law enforcement. Stevenson wins a hearing for Walter where he can present his new evidence: Ralph’s testimony, which is confirmed by health care workers and other inmates, as well as recordings of the law enforcement team threatening Ralph if he doesn’t frame Walter. 
While the judge refuses to grant Walter relief, Stevenson continues the appeal process through the Alabama courts. The district attorney asks outside agents to investigate the murder for which Walter was convicted, and the investigators determine that Walter had nothing to do with the crime. Six weeks later, the court invalidates Walter’s conviction. Stevenson and the State file a joint motion to dismiss the charges, and Walter is set free.
Throughout the process, Stevenson and Walter become close friends, and Stevenson helps Walter upon his release, including filing a civil suit on his behalf and offering him a place to stay. Walter works with Stevenson to share his story, giving interviews and speaking at legal conferences, and Walter is even featured in a documentary. Unfortunately, Walter is diagnosed with advancing dementia and is forced to rely on family and eventually a nursing facility for his care. He dies in 2013. Stevenson gives a eulogy at his funeral and shares all he learned from Walter, particularly that we must extend mercy to everyone, even those who have not earned it.
Interspersed with chapters chronicling Walter’s narrative are stories of Stevenson’s other clients and work. His closeness with these prisoners and their horrifying circumstances makes Stevenson more determined to help and causes him to reflect on abstract issues that nevertheless imbue the criminal justice system, like humanity and mercy. Stevenson focuses on several categories of vulnerable people who become trapped in the system, including mentally ill prisoners, disabled prisoners, and poor women who give birth to stillborn babies. 
Stevenson and his team at EJI also become increasingly focused on juvenile offenders who are sometimes tried as adults despite their young age. These offenders may be given de facto death sentences by being sentenced to life without parole and face perilous circumstances when they are housed in adult prisons. Stevenson illustrates how these prisoners retain their own humanity while being forced to live under inhumane conditions. He also discusses some of the qualities common among these types of prisoners: They are generally poor and disproportionately people of color, and most of them lack adequate legal counsel. The juveniles have horrific backgrounds of abuse and neglect.
Stevenson and his team at EJI also work to change the legal system to offer more protection to marginalized people. Several of his cases end up before the U.S. Supreme Court, and he succeeds in winning rulings that ban as unconstitutional the conviction of children to life without parole and the execution of people deemed incompetent from dementia or neurological disease. EJI works to raise public awareness of issues surrounding unfair incarceration, produces groundbreaking reports on racial issues, and sets up programs to help formerly incarcerated people adjust to life on the outside.
Stevenson also reflects on the issues that surround the criminal justice system. His time spent with prisoners awaiting their execution makes him realize how inhumane it is to prepare another human to die. After decades of work, when Stevenson fails to prevent the execution of a man who suffers from an intellectual disability, he momentarily feels unable to continue his work. However, he realizes that he cannot help but be broken by his experiences and comes to understand that it is his own brokenness that allows him to more fully understand the need for mercy and to bring compassion to others. The book ends with Stevenson’s renewed commitment to helping others."
Reviewed,"In Outliers: The Story of Success, Malcolm Gladwell considers the circumstances that lead to success. The first half of the book looks closely at how opportunities matter more in the lives of successful people than hard work or raw talent. The second half of the book focuses on cultural legacies: behavioral tendencies rooted in their ancestral past.
Part One examines the role of opportunity in the lives of extremely successful people. Gladwell’s first example is the Canadian Hockey League, the world’s most competitive youth hockey league. Since the cutoff date for the Canadian leagues that serve the youngest players is January 1, those born in the first part of the calendar year are much larger and more coordinated than their peers. The larger and more coordinated kids are given more playing time and better coaching, and thus become better players by the time they reach the top league. An overwhelming majority of Canadian professional hockey players have birthdays in January, February or March.
Gladwell proposes that 10,000 hours of practice is needed to master a skill, even for prodigies like Mozart. Bill Joy, Bill Gates, and the Beatles all worked hard to achieve success but benefited from opportunities they did not create. Joy, one of the founders of Sun Microsystems, happened to attend one of the first colleges in the world with a time-sharing terminal. In graduate school, he had a terminal in his room, where he spent all of his free time programming. Gates happened to attend a private high school with a time-sharing terminal connected to a mainframe in Seattle. He also was able to spend all of his free time programming. Early on, the Beatles were hired to play long shows day after day in Hamburg, Germany. 
Birth year or era is another form of opportunity. Gates and Joy (as well as other early programmers) all reached the end of their teen years just as personal computers became available to the public. In another example, fourteen of the top seventy-five richest people in the history of the world happened to be alive at the same time, in the same country: the United States in the mid-1800s.
Opportunity matters more than an individual’s IQ. Using a study conducted by Lewis Terman, the creator of the Stanford-Binet IQ test, Gladwell shows that “practical intelligence” is as important as “analytical intelligence.” He also contrasts Chris Langan, one of the world’s smartest living people, with Robert Oppenheimer. While both had difficulties in college, only Oppenheimer had a successful life, due to his practical intelligence.
The last portion of Part One looks at Joe Flom, a successful lawyer from New York City. While he was born into a poor family to Jewish immigrants (in a time when Jewish immigrants were not treated well), many of the disadvantages in his life were actually benefits and directly contributed to his success.
Part Two investigates cultural legacies. Using flight recorder transcripts from several plane crashes from the last few decades, Gladwell shows that cultural expectations and habits can be a severe hindrance to pilots. Copilots from countries that have a high “Power Distance Index” (those that show the most deference to authority) will often avoid telling pilots that they are making mistakes, even when the mistakes are potentially fatal. After recognizing the dangers of such cultural expectations, commercial aviation has instituted programs to change the way flight crews talk with one another. 
Gladwell next analyzes the disparity in public school math test scores between Eastern and Western countries. He suggests that the cultures in which rice paddy farming is historically important have a stronger work ethic. Using various examples, Gladwell shows that hard work has a greater impact on success in learning mathematics than intelligence. 
The final example is an examination of the KIPP school in the South Bronx and the “achievement gap” between socioeconomic groups. American students from middle-class and affluent households retain more information over summer vacation and are more likely to make additional gains than students from low-income households. The KIPP school uses longer school days and summer programming to eliminate the achievement gap for low-income children. While the work schedule is very rigorous, the school’s students go on to great academic success.
Gladwell demonstrates that if more opportunities were available, there would be far more successful people and the world would be richer for it."
Disciplined,"Lawyer Bryan Stevenson gives a first-person account of his decades helping marginalized Americans who have been unfairly and harshly punished by the U.S. criminal justice system, which disproportionately targets people of color and poor people. At the heart of Just Mercy is the story of Walter McMillian, a Black man who was framed for the murder of a girl named Ronda Morrison, convicted, and sent to death row. 
Stevenson alternates chapters about Walter with his personal reflections on our country’s history with racial disparity and issues around incarceration. Stevenson highlights other groups of vulnerable people who have been victimized by the criminal justice system and shares the stories of the prisoners he has helped over the years. The book also follows the growth of Stevenson’s nonprofit law project, the Alabama-based Equal Justice Initiative (EJI), through its expansion from focusing on death row prisoners to helping people sentenced to life without parole. Stevenson chronicles how EJI becomes a significant force in criminal justice reform.
In 1983 as a law student, Stevenson discovers his life’s passion when he interns with the Georgia-based Southern Prisoners Defense Committee and meets his first death row prisoner. After graduation Stevenson accepts a job with the organization to represent poor prisoners, including those in Alabama who lack any public defender. He meets Walter McMillian on Alabama’s death row. Walter owns a successful business but also transgresses racial boundaries when he has an affair with a white woman. Soon after the affair becomes public, the woman’s friend, Ralph Myers, accuses Walter of committing the unsolved murder of Ronda Morrison, which has outraged the community.

Awakened,"The Awakening opens in the late 1800s in Grand Isle, a summer holiday resort popular with the wealthy inhabitants of nearby New Orleans. Edna Pontellier is vacationing with her husband, Léonce, and their two sons at the cottages of Madame Lebrun, which house affluent Creoles from the French Quarter. Léonce is kind and loving but preoccupied with his work. His frequent business-related absences mar his domestic life with Edna. Consequently, Edna spends most of her time with her friend Adèle Ratignolle, a married Creole who epitomizes womanly elegance and charm. Through her relationship with Adèle, Edna learns a great deal about freedom of expression. Because Creole women were expected and assumed to be chaste, they could behave in a forthright and unreserved manner. Exposure to such openness liberates Edna from her previously prudish behavior and repressed emotions and desires.
Edna’s relationship with Adèle begins Edna’s process of “awakening” and self-discovery, which constitutes the focus of the book. The process accelerates as Edna comes to know Robert Lebrun, the elder, single son of Madame Lebrun. Robert is known among the Grand Isle vacationers as a man who chooses one woman each year—often a married woman—to whom he then plays “attendant” all summer long. This summer, he devotes himself to Edna, and the two spend their days together lounging and talking by the shore. Adèle Ratignolle often accompanies them.
At first, the relationship between Robert and Edna is innocent. They mostly bathe in the sea or engage in idle talk. As the summer progresses, however, Edna and Robert grow closer, and Robert’s affections and attention inspire in Edna several internal revelations. She feels more alive than ever before, and she starts to paint again as she did in her youth. She also learns to swim and becomes aware of her independence and sexuality. Edna and Robert never openly discuss their love for one another, but the time they spend alone together kindles memories in Edna of the dreams and desires of her youth. She becomes inexplicably depressed at night with her husband and profoundly joyful during her moments of freedom, whether alone or with Robert. Recognizing how intense the relationship between him and Edna has become, Robert honorably removes himself from Grand Isle to avoid consummating his forbidden love. Edna returns to New Orleans a changed woman.
Back in New Orleans, Edna actively pursues her painting and ignores all of her social responsibilities. Worried about the changing attitude and increasing disobedience of his wife, Léonce seeks the guidance of the family physician, Doctor Mandelet. A wise and enlightened man, Doctor Mandelet suspects that Edna’s transformation is the result of an affair, but he hides his suspicions from Léonce. Instead, Doctor Mandelet suggests that Léonce let Edna’s defiance run its course, since attempts to control her would only fuel her rebellion. Léonce heeds the doctor’s advice, allowing Edna to remain home alone while he is away on business. With her husband gone and her children away as well, Edna wholly rejects her former lifestyle. She moves into a home of her own and declares herself independent—the possession of no one. Her love for Robert still intense, Edna pursues an affair with the town seducer, Alcée Arobin, who is able to satisfy her sexual needs. Never emotionally attached to Arobin, Edna maintains control throughout their affair, satisfying her animalistic urges but retaining her freedom from male domination.
At this point, the self-sufficient and unconventional old pianist Mademoiselle Reisz adopts Edna as a sort of protégé, warning Edna of the sacrifices required of an artist. Edna is moved by Mademoiselle Reisz’s piano playing and visits her often. She is also eager to read the letters from abroad that Robert sends the woman. A woman who devotes her life entirely to her art, Mademoiselle serves as an inspiration and model to Edna, who continues her process of awakening and independence. Mademoiselle Reisz is the only person who knows of Robert and Edna’s secret love for one another and she encourages Edna to admit to, and act upon, her feelings.
Unable to stay away, Robert returns to New Orleans, finally expressing openly his feelings for Edna. He admits his love but reminds her that they cannot possibly be together, since she is the wife of another man. Edna explains to him her newly established independence, denying the rights of her husband over her and explaining how she and Robert can live together happily, ignoring everything extraneous to their relationship. But despite his love for Edna, Robert feels unable to enter into the adulterous affair.
When Adèle undergoes a difficult and dangerous childbirth, Edna leaves Robert’s arms to go to her friend. She pleads with him to wait for her return. From the time she spends with Edna, Adèle senses that Edna is becoming increasingly distant, and she understands that Edna’s relationship with Robert has intensified. She reminds Edna to think of her children and advocates the socially acceptable lifestyle Edna abandoned so long ago. Doctor Mandelet, while walking Edna home from Adèle’s, urges her to come see him because he is worried about the outcome of her passionate but confused actions. Already reeling under the weight of Adèle’s admonition, Edna begins to perceive herself as having acted selfishly.
Edna returns to her house to find Robert gone, a note of farewell left in his place. Robert’s inability to escape the ties of society now prompts Edna’s most devastating awakening. Haunted by thoughts of her children and realizing that she would have eventually found even Robert unable to fulfill her desires and dreams, Edna feels an overwhelming sense of solitude. Alone in a world in which she has found no feeling of belonging, she can find only one answer to the inescapable and heartbreaking limitations of society. She returns to Grand Isle, the site of her first moments of emotional, sexual, and intellectual awareness, and, in a final escape, gives herself to the sea. As she swims through the soft, embracing water, she thinks about her freedom from her husband and children, as well as Robert’s failure to understand her, Doctor Mandelet’s words of wisdom, and Mademoiselle Reisz’s courage. The text leaves open the question of whether the suicide constitutes a cowardly surrender or a liberating triumph."
Crime,"In Born a Crime: Stories from a South African Childhood, comedian and television personality Trevor Noah gives a heartfelt and funny recounting of his experiences growing up in South Africa as an oppressed person. Stories of Noah’s life are interspersed with insights into South Africa’s culture, systems, and history. Noah was born in 1984 to a single mother, Patricia, during the time of racial segregation known as apartheid. Patricia was a strong, driven woman who paid little heed to the racist laws that oppressed her. Noah’s father, Robert, agreed to give Patricia a child during a time when sexual relationships between black and white South Africans were illegal. Robert, a Swiss immigrant, never supported segregation and did what he could to undermine apartheid. Because it was dangerous for Patricia and Robert to be seen with their mixed-race child, Noah recalls sometimes being momentarily abandoned by his parents in public settings.
Dutch colonizers came to South Africa in the 1600s and used slave labor to run their farms on stolen land. The white South Africans called Afrikaners are descended from these colonizers. Black South Africans, from tribes including the Zulu, Xhosa, and Sotho tribes, were subjugated under apartheid law until the mid-1990s. A third racial group emerged from the intermingling of the Black and white South Africans: mixed-race or “colored.” Both during apartheid and after its dissolution, mixed-race South Africans were the most marginalized and disenfranchised people. Noah often felt defined by what he wasn’t: not light enough to be labeled as white and not dark enough to be fully accepted into Black culture.
Apartheid ended in 1994, but Noah’s struggles as a mixed-race child in South Africa continued. It was often hard for Noah to determine which groups would accept him. Patricia had always encouraged her son to read and think independently; she valued education and made sure that her son spoke multiple languages. Of the eleven official languages in South Africa, Noah could speak Zulu, Tsonga, English, and Afrikaans. This skill allowed him to move among different racial and cultural groups at school. Though Noah felt out of place in many social settings, his ability to talk and empathize with many different types of people served him well throughout his life. Even at a young age, Noah understood that the bullying he experienced from his mixed-race peers was likely a result of the self-hatred all mixed-race South Africans had been taught. Noah was a mischievous child, but Patricia believed in tempering her punishments with assurances to her son that she held him accountable because she loved him. Patricia knew that the world would not always be kind and generous to Noah, and she wanted to prepare him well.
During his high school years, Noah acquired a small bootleg CD business from a friend. Noah soon found that he could make more money working with his friend Sizwe, who was from the poorer, crowded Johannesburg township called Alexandra—known to most residents as Alex. After graduation Noah moved to Alex to expand his profits, with Sizwe’s help. Sizwe recognized that Noah had talent as a live DJ, and the pair formed a performance group. Noah and his group sold bootleg and mixed CDs, dealt in stolen goods, performed at parties and concerts, and did their best to avoid confrontations with local law enforcement. Noah was already familiar with the South African police. Patricia received no help from the local police when she tried to file charges against her abusive husband. Noah was arrested for shoplifting, on suspicion of carrying a weapon, and for driving an unregistered vehicle. One arrest kept Noah in jail for several days, and Patricia had to pay for his lawyer. Despite his dealings with law enforcement, Noah could see his own privilege in comparison to many of his peers. Patricia had worked hard to make sure her son had the ability to make a life for himself.
The men in Noah’s life taught him little about how to interact with women. Robert was a distant but generally pleasant presence. Patricia’s father, Temperance Noah, was an unpredictable figure. Later, Noah would learn that his grandfather had bipolar disorder and would often beat his wife, Frances. Patricia experienced abuse in her marriage as well. Noah’s stepfather, Abel, became acquainted with Patricia and her young son during their many visits to the automotive shop where Abel worked on their run-down car. After Abel and Patricia married, he bought the shop. Patricia was forced to sell her home to keep the business running, and the family spent a stressful year living in the shop warehouse. Abel often came home drunk, and he began beating his wife. Once Abel had sons of his own, Noah’s half-brothers Andrew and Isaac, Abel’s hostility toward Patricia’s oldest son grew. When Patricia learned that her violent husband had bought a gun, she helped Noah move out on his own. 
One day, Noah received a phone call from Andrew with news that Abel, now estranged from his family, had come to Patricia’s new house and shot her in the head as she was shielding Andrew and Isaac. Miraculously, Patricia survived. Noah was able to cover her medical bills, and Patricia thanked God for protecting her and giving her a son who could afford to help her."
Endeavors,"Walden opens with a simple announcement that Thoreau spent two years in Walden Pond, near Concord, Massachusetts, living a simple life supported by no one. He says that he now resides among the civilized again; the episode was clearly both experimental and temporary. The first chapter, “Economy,” is a manifesto of social thought and meditations on domestic management, and in it Thoreau sketches out his ideals as he describes his pond project. He devotes attention to the skepticism and wonderment with which townspeople had greeted news of his project, and he defends himself from their views that society is the only place to live. He recounts the circumstances of his move to Walden Pond, along with a detailed account of the steps he took to construct his rustic habitation and the methods by which he supported himself in the course of his wilderness experiment. It is a chapter full of facts, figures, and practical advice, but also offers big ideas about the claims of individualism versus social existence, all interspersed with evidence of scholarship and a propensity for humor.
Thoreau tells us that he completed his cabin in the spring of 1845 and moved in on July 4 of that year. Most of the materials and tools he used to build his home he borrowed or scrounged from previous sites. The land he squats on belongs to his friend Ralph Waldo Emerson; he details a cost-analysis of the entire construction project. In order to make a little money, Thoreau cultivates a modest bean-field, a job that tends to occupy his mornings. He reserves his afternoons and evenings for contemplation, reading, and walking about the countryside. Endorsing the values of austerity, simplicity, and solitude, Thoreau consistently emphasizes the minimalism of his lifestyle and the contentment to be derived from it. He repeatedly contrasts his own freedom with the imprisonment of others who devote their lives to material prosperity.
Despite his isolation, Thoreau feels the presence of society surrounding him. The Fitchburg Railroad rushes past Walden Pond, interrupting his reveries and forcing him to contemplate the power of technology. Thoreau also finds occasion to converse with a wide range of other people, such as the occasional peasant farmer, railroad worker, or the odd visitor to Walden. He describes in some detail his association with a Canadian-born woodcutter, Alex Therien, who is grand and sincere in his character, though modest in intellectual attainments. Thoreau makes frequent trips into Concord to seek the society of his longtime friends and to conduct what scattered business the season demands. On one such trip, Thoreau spends a night in jail for refusing to pay a poll tax because, he says, the government supports slavery. Released the next day, Thoreau returns to Walden.
Thoreau devotes great attention to nature, the passing of the seasons, and the creatures with which he shares the woods. He recounts the habits of a panoply of animals, from woodchucks to partridges. Some he endows with a larger meaning, often spiritual or psychological. The hooting loon that plays hide and seek with Thoreau, for instance, becomes a symbol of the playfulness of nature and its divine laughter at human endeavors. Another example of animal symbolism is the full-fledged ant war that Thoreau stumbles upon, prompting him to meditate on human warfare. Thoreau’s interest in animals is not exactly like the naturalist’s or zoologist’s. He does not observe and describe them neutrally and scientifically, but gives them a moral and philosophical significance, as if each has a distinctive lesson to teach him.
As autumn turns to winter, Thoreau begins preparations for the arrival of the cold. He listens to the squirrel, the rabbit, and the fox as they scuttle about gathering food. He watches the migrating birds, and welcomes the pests that infest his cabin as they escape the coming frosts. He prepares his walls with plaster to shut out the wind. By day he makes a study of the snow and ice, giving special attention to the mystic blue ice of Walden Pond, and by night he sits and listens to the wind as it whips and whistles outside his door. Thoreau occasionally sees ice-fishermen come to cut out huge blocks that are shipped off to cities, and contemplates how most of the ice will melt and flow back to Walden Pond. Occasionally Thoreau receives a visit from a friend like William Ellery Channing or Amos Bronson Alcott, but for the most part he is alone. In one chapter, he conjures up visions of earlier residents of Walden Pond long dead and largely forgotten, including poor tradesmen and former slaves. Thoreau prefers to see himself in their company, rather than amid the cultivated and wealthy classes.
As he becomes acquainted with Walden Pond and neighboring ponds, Thoreau wants to map their layout and measure their depths. Thoreau finds that Walden Pond is no more than a hundred feet deep, thereby refuting common folk wisdom that it is bottomless. He meditates on the pond as a symbol of infinity that people need in their lives. Eventually winter gives way to spring, and with a huge crash and roar the ice of Walden Pond begins to melt and hit the shore. In lyric imagery echoing the onset of Judgment Day, Thoreau describes the coming of spring as a vast transformation of the face of the world, a time when all sins are forgiven.
Thoreau announces that his project at the pond is over, and that he returned to civilized life on September 6, 1847. The revitalization of the landscape suggests the restoration of the full powers of the human soul, and Thoreau’s narrative observations give way, in the last chapter of Walden, to a more direct sermonizing about the untapped potential within humanity. In visionary language, Thoreau exhorts us to “meet” our lives and live fully."
Written,"Two migrant workers, George and Lennie, have been let off a bus miles away from the California farm where they are due to start work. George is a small, dark man with “sharp, strong features.” Lennie, his companion, is his opposite, a giant of a man with a “shapeless” face. Overcome with thirst, the two stop in a clearing by a pool and decide to camp for the night. As the two converse, it becomes clear that Lennie has an intellectual disability, and is deeply devoted to George and dependent upon him for protection and guidance. George finds that Lennie, who loves petting soft things but often accidentally kills them, has been carrying and stroking a dead mouse. George angrily throws it away, fearing that Lennie might catch a disease from the dead animal. George complains loudly that his life would be easier without having to care for Lennie, but the reader senses that their friendship and devotion is mutual. He and Lennie share a dream of buying their own piece of land, farming it, and, much to Lennie’s delight, keeping rabbits. George ends the night by treating Lennie to the story he often tells him about what life will be like in such an idyllic place.
The next day, the men report to the nearby ranch. George, fearing how the boss will react to Lennie, insists that he’ll do all the talking. He lies, explaining that they travel together because they are cousins and that a horse kicked Lennie in the head when he was a child. They are hired. They meet Candy, an old “swamper,” or handyman, with a missing hand and an ancient dog, and Curley, the boss’s mean-spirited son. Curley is newly married, possessive of his flirtatious wife, and full of jealous suspicion. Once George and Lennie are alone in the bunkhouse, Curley’s wife appears and flirts with them. Lennie thinks she is “purty,” but George, sensing the trouble that could come from tangling with this woman and her husband, warns Lennie to stay away from her. Soon, the ranch-hands return from the fields for lunch, and George and Lennie meet Slim, the skilled mule driver who wields great authority on the ranch. Slim comments on the rarity of friendship like that between George and Lennie. Carlson, another ranch-hand, suggests that since Slim’s dog has just given birth, they should offer a puppy to Candy and shoot Candy’s old, good-for-nothing dog.
The next day, George confides in Slim that he and Lennie are not cousins, but have been friends since childhood. He tells how Lennie has often gotten them into trouble. For instance, they were forced to flee their last job because Lennie tried to touch a woman’s dress and was accused of rape. Slim agrees to give Lennie one of his puppies, and Carlson continues to badger Candy to kill his old dog. When Slim agrees with Carlson, saying that death would be a welcome relief to the suffering animal, Candy gives in. Carlson, before leading the dog outside, promises to do the job painlessly.
Slim goes to the barn to do some work, and Curley, who is maniacally searching for his wife, heads to the barn to accost Slim. Candy overhears George and Lennie discussing their plans to buy land, and offers his life’s savings if they will let him live there too. The three make a pact to let no one else know of their plan. Slim returns to the bunkhouse, berating Curley for his suspicions. Curley, searching for an easy target for his anger, finds Lennie and picks a fight with him. Lennie crushes Curley’s hand in the altercation. Slim warns Curley that if he tries to get George and Lennie fired, he will be the laughingstock of the farm.
The next night, most of the men go to the local brothel. Lennie is left with Crooks, the lonely, Black stable-hand, and Candy. Curley’s wife flirts with them, refusing to leave until the other men come home. She notices the cuts on Lennie’s face and suspects that he, and not a piece of machinery as Curley claimed, is responsible for hurting her husband. This thought amuses her. The next day, Lennie accidentally kills his puppy in the barn. Curley’s wife enters and consoles him. She admits that life with Curley is a disappointment, and wishes that she had followed her dream of becoming a movie star. Lennie tells her that he loves petting soft things, and she offers to let him feel her hair. When he grabs too tightly, she cries out. In his attempt to silence her, he accidentally breaks her neck.
Lennie flees back to a pool of the Salinas River that George had designated as a meeting place should either of them get into trouble. As the men back at the ranch discover what has happened and gather together a lynch party, George joins Lennie. Much to Lennie’s surprise, George is not mad at him for doing “a bad thing.” George begins to tell Lennie the story of the farm they will have together. As he describes the rabbits that Lennie will tend, the sound of the approaching lynch party grows louder. George shoots his friend in the back of the head.
When the other men arrive, George lets them believe that Lennie had the gun, and George wrestled it away from him and shot him. Only Slim understands what has really happened, that George has killed his friend out of mercy. Slim consolingly leads him away, and the other men, completely puzzled, watch them leave."
L,"Meursault, the narrator, is a young man living in Algiers. After receiving a telegram informing him of his mother’s death, he takes a bus to Marengo, where his mother had been living in an old persons’ home. He sleeps for almost the entire trip. When he arrives, he speaks to the director of the home. The director allows Meursault to see his mother, but Meursault finds that her body has already been sealed in the coffin. He declines the caretaker’s offer to open the coffin.
That night, Meursault keeps vigil over his mother’s body. Much to his displeasure, the talkative caretaker stays with him the whole time. Meursault smokes a cigarette, drinks coffee, and dozes off. The next morning, before the funeral, he meets with the director again. The director informs him that Thomas Perez, an old man who had grown very close to Meursault’s mother, will be attending the funeral service. The funeral procession heads for the small local village, but Perez has difficulty keeping up and eventually faints from the heat. Meursault reports that he remembers little of the funeral. That night, he happily arrives back in Algiers.
The next day, Meursault goes to the public beach for a swim. There, he runs into Marie Cardona, his former co-worker. The two make a date to see a comedy at the movie theater that evening. After the movie they spend the night together. When Meursault wakes up, Marie is gone. He stays in bed until noon and then sits on his balcony until evening, watching the people pass on the street.
The following day, Monday, Meursault returns to work. He has lunch with his friend Emmanuel and then works all afternoon. While walking upstairs to his apartment that night, Meursault runs into Salamano, an old man who lives in his building and owns a mangy dog. Meursault also runs into his neighbor, Raymond Sintes, who is widely rumored to be a pimp. Raymond invites Meursault over for dinner. Over the meal, Raymond recounts how he beat up his mistress after he discovered that she had been cheating on him. As a result, he got into a fight with her brother. Raymond now wants to torment his mistress even more, but he needs Meursault to write a letter to lure his mistress back to him. Meursault agrees and writes the letter that night.
The following Saturday, Marie visits Meursault at his apartment. She asks Meursault if he loves her, and he replies that “it didn’t mean anything,” but probably not. The two then hear shouting coming from Raymond’s apartment. They go out into the hall and watch as a policeman arrives. The policeman slaps Raymond and says that he will be summoned to the police station for beating up his mistress. Later, Raymond asks Meursault to testify on his behalf, and Meursault agrees. That night, Raymond runs into Salamano, who laments that his dog has run away.
Marie asks Meursault if he wants to marry her. He replies indifferently but says that they can get married if she wants to, so they become engaged. The following Sunday, Meursault, Marie, and Raymond go to a beach house owned by Masson, one of Raymond’s friends. They swim happily in the ocean and then have lunch. That afternoon, Masson, Raymond, and Meursault run into two Arabs on the beach, one of whom is the brother of Raymond’s mistress. A fight breaks out and Raymond is stabbed. After tending to his wounds, Raymond returns to the beach with Meursault. They find the Arabs at a spring. Raymond considers shooting them with his gun, but Meursault talks him out of it and takes the gun away. Later, however, Meursault returns to the spring to cool off, and, for no apparent reason, he shoots Raymond’s mistress’s brother.
Meursault is arrested and thrown into jail. His lawyer seems disgusted at Meursault’s lack of remorse over his crime, and, in particular, at Meursault’s lack of grief at his mother’s funeral. Later, Meursault meets with the examining magistrate, who cannot understand Meursault’s actions. The magistrate brandishes a crucifix and demands that Meursault put his faith in God. Meursault refuses, insisting that he does not believe in God. The magistrate cannot accept Meursault’s lack of belief, and eventually dubs him “Monsieur Antichrist.”
One day, Marie visits Meursault in prison. She forces herself to smile during the visit, and she expresses hope that Meursault will be acquitted and that they will get married. As he awaits his trial, Meursault slowly adapts to prison life. His isolation from nature, women, and cigarettes torments him at first, but he eventually adjusts to living without them, and soon does not even notice their absence. He manages to keep his mind occupied, and he sleeps for most of each day.
Meursault is taken to the courthouse early on the morning of his trial. Spectators and members of the press fill the courtroom. The subject of the trial quickly shifts away from the murder to a general discussion of Meursault’s character, and of his reaction to his mother’s death in particular. The director and several other people who attended the vigil and the funeral are called to testify, and they all attest to Meursault’s lack of grief or tears. Marie reluctantly testifies that the day after his mother’s funeral she and Meursault went on a date and saw a comedic movie. During his summation the following day, the prosecutor calls Meursault a monster and says that his lack of moral feeling threatens all of society. Meursault is found guilty and is sentenced to death by beheading.
Meursault returns to prison to await his execution. He struggles to come to terms with his situation, and he has trouble accepting the certainty and inevitability of his fate. He imagines escaping and he dreams of filing a successful legal appeal. One day, the chaplain comes to visit against Meursault’s wishes. He urges Meursault to renounce his atheism and turn to God, but Meursault refuses. Like the magistrate, the chaplain cannot believe that Meursault does not long for faith and the afterlife. Meursault suddenly becomes enraged, grabs the chaplain, and begins shouting at him. He declares that he is correct in believing in a meaningless, purely physical world. For the first time, Meursault truly embraces the idea that human existence holds no greater meaning. He abandons all hope for the future and accepts the “gentle indifference of the world.” This acceptance makes Meursault feel happy."
Loath,"Starr Carter, a sixteen-year-old black girl, attends a party in her neighborhood, Garden Heights. Starr goes with Kenya, a friend with whom she shares an older half-brother, Seven. Ever since attending Williamson Prep, a primarily white school, Starr feels out of place in the Garden Heights social scene. When Kenya goes off with other friends, Starr runs into her childhood best friend, Khalil Harris, whom she hasn’t seen in a long time. Gunshots from a gang fight interrupt the party, and Khalil offers to take Starr home. While Khalil drives, he explains rapper Tupac Shakur’s idea that “Thug Life” stands for “The Hate U Give Little Infants F---- Everybody.” Soon after, a white police officer with the badge number one-fifteen pulls them over. Khalil questions the motivation for the stop, and One-Fifteen orders him out of the car and searches him. One-Fifteen commands Khalil not to move, and returns to his car. Khalil opens the door to check on Starr. One-Fifteen fatally shoots Khalil.
Starr has nightmares about the death of another childhood friend, Natasha, who died in the crossfire of a gang shooting. At school on Monday, Starr feels tense around Hailey and Chris, her white friend and boyfriend, as memories of Khalil’s death interrupt her thoughts and she realizes they don’t understand. At the urging of her uncle Carlos, a police officer, Starr goes into the police station after school with her mother, Lisa, to testify about Khalil’s shooting. Starr realizes that the officers are asking more questions about whether Khalil was a troublemaker than about the night of the shooting. She worries that justice for Khalil will not be served. At Khalil’s funeral, a lawyer and activist named April Ofrah confirms Starr’s fears when she announces that the police will not pursue legal action against One-Fifteen and invites the attendees to a rally in Khalil’s honor. Starr blames herself for the police’s inaction. King, the head of a local gang called the King Lords, also interrupts the funeral and places a gray bandana on Khalil’s casket, signifying Khalil’s membership in the King Lords. April Ofrah tells Starr to call her if she needs legal representation.
The news that the police won’t prosecute One-Fifteen leads to days of protests in Garden Heights. During this time, Maverick, Starr’s father, explains to her his interpretation of Tupac’s phrase “Thug Life.” He believes that Thug Life describes a system designed against black communities. Only by speaking out can black communities begin to break the cycle. At the Carter family’s grocery store, a teenage member of the King Lords named DeVante begs Maverick, a former King Lord, to help him leave the gang. Maverick agrees. Starr sees DeVante’s request as a chance to help someone in a similar situation as Khalil. A few days later, Maverick gets into an argument with the neighborhood barber, Mr. Lewis. Although the argument is peaceful, two police officers intervene, and when they see Maverick is Starr’s father, they push him to the ground and search him. Between this scary event and pressure from Kenya, Starr decides that she will no longer be silent.
The District Attorney calls Lisa to announce that a grand jury will hear the case against One-Fifteen and asks if Starr will testify. Starr agrees, and April Ofrah decides to represent Starr pro bono, and also find a way to get Starr a television interview. Meanwhile, DeVante tells Starr that Khalil had never been a member of the King Lords and only sold drugs for King to protect his mother, who had stolen money from King. During Starr’s television interview, she decides, against Ms. Ofrah’s advice, to talk about the truth behind Khalil’s drug dealing. Starr’s implication of King enrages him. The night before her grand jury testimony, someone throws a brick and fires a gun into the Carter household. Unsure if the culprits are the King Lords or the police, Starr almost backs out of testifying. However, she ultimately decides that Khalil needs her truth. She testifies before the grand jury.
Almost two months later, the grand jury announces their decision not to indict One-Fifteen. Starr and some of her friends get caught up in the resulting riots. As she tries to avoid the chaos, Starr stumbles upon a protest led by Ms. Ofrah. She offers Starr the megaphone, and Starr leads a chant in front of the protest. The police try to break up the protest with tear gas. Starr and her friends head to the Carter family store to get milk to help heal their eyes. A Molotov cocktail lands in the store, setting it ablaze and trapping them. Maverick arrives just in time to unlock the back door. King arrives to taunt them, proud about getting his revenge. The police arrive, and King, confident that no one will testify against him, claims ignorance. However, the neighbors rally around the Carter family and tell the police that they saw King throw the Molotov cocktail. The police arrest King. Although the grocery store is in ruins, Starr knows that the family will rebuild. She vows to continue fighting for justice on behalf of Khalil and all other black people killed at the hands of police."
Early,"Speak, by Laurie Halse Anderson, chronicles the struggles of thirteen-year-old Melinda Sordino after she is a raped by at a party the summer before her freshman year of high school by another student. Melinda tells her story in first person narrative. She describes events within the framework of the four marking periods of the school year.
In the opening part of Speak, “First Marking Period,” Melinda begins high school, and we learn that former friends now hate her. She experiences humiliation in the cafeteria and Mr. Neck, a social studies teacher, further embarrasses her by giving her demerits on the first day of school. Ostracized by her former friends, she befriends Heather, a new girl at the school. Heather seeks popularity, and she badgers Melinda to join various clubs. Rachel, Melinda’s ex-best friend, hasn’t tried to find out the truth about what really happened to Melinda that night at the party over the summer.
Melinda describes her classes, activities, and thoughts. Her project in Mr. Freeman’s art class is to create a work of art based on a “tree,” which is the object named on the piece of paper she randomly chooses. In biology, Melinda thinks that David Petrakis, her lab partner, might be cute without the braces. And in algebra, when Mr. Stetman has Rachel come to the board to help Melinda with a problem, Melinda is humiliated. 
Melinda often skips class using stolen late passes and doesn’t complete her homework. She finds refuge at school in a vacant janitor’s closet, which she turns into her “burrow.” At the Homecoming Rally, students bully her for being the one who called the cops that night at the party.
At home, Melinda and her parents communicate with each other by leaving notes on the refrigerator. In her bedroom, she no longer wants to look in the mirror and puts it in the back of her closet. Toward the end of the marking period, Melinda’s parents hear from the school about her missing work, and she remains silent while they berate her for failing. Through it all, Melinda sees “IT” everywhere, the nightmare from which she cannot awaken.
In “Second Marking Period,” school is a grind for Melinda. At her parents’ insistence, she stays after to finish her homework, but she goes to her burrow and naps instead. In social studies, David Petrakis stands up against Mr. Neck’s racist rant about immigration. In biology, she finds that a seed within the apple she has cut is already growing. Heather gives her an early Christmas present, and Melinda decides she’ll give Heather a friendship necklace. 
On Christmas, Melinda nearly tells her parents what happened that night last summer but can’t. Winter break is miserable. Her parents keep her busy working for them, and she is relieved when school starts again. 
In gym class, Melinda impresses the basketball coaches with skills but has no interest in being on the team. She reluctantly helps Heather in her attempts to become an initiated member of a do-good club. And in biology, when she and David dissect a frog, she faints when preparing to slice it open. 
Melinda’s parents receive another call from the guidance counselor about her grades. After their verbal assault, Melinda goes to her room and uses an open paper clip to scrape at her wrist. 
“IT”, who we learn is Andy Evans, harasses Melinda in the cafeteria, and she runs to the bathroom to vomit. She has yet to tell anyone, even the reader, about what happened that summer night.
In “Third Marking Period,” Melinda continues to skip school and avoid Andy Evans. Heather ends their friendship suddenly, and later returns the friendship necklace Melinda had given her for Christmas. No one, Melinda is sure, “would like the inside girl I think I am.” 
The school counselors hold another meeting with Melinda’s parents, who berate and threaten her. She refuses to talk or defend herself. She receives In-School Suspension, and IT is there. He sits next to her and blows in her ear when Mr. Neck isn’t looking. 
In art class, Mr. Freeman gives Melinda a book about Picasso to help her “paralyzed” imagination. Picasso’s art inspires her, and she begins to draw. Mr. Freeman recognizes that she has a lot to say.
Melinda works to meet the expectations set for her. Yet, with “no friends in the known universe,” Melinda sits alone at lunch, wondering if everyone is talking and laughing about her. 
One afternoon, after a basketball game, David Petrakis invites her to his house for pizza to celebrate the team’s one-point win. She declines, torn between getting a life, and the fact that the world is a dangerous place.
At last, Melinda reveals that she was attacked at a party last summer, though she does not use the word “rape.” At this point, we (the readers) are the only ones besides Melinda who know what happened.
In “Fourth Marking Period,” Melinda takes her ex-friend Ivy’s advice and tries drawing a tree instead of carving one from linoleum block. She also learns that Rachel is dating Andy Evans. Compelled to do something, she writes a note to Rachel warning her about Andy. In the note, she admits for the first time (but without divulging her identity), that she was raped. 
Springtime arrives, and Melinda finds solace working in the garden. She and David plan a protest in social studies class over an oral report she is supposed to present, and she stands up to Heather by refusing to help her decorate for the Senior Prom. She writes on a stall in the bathroom, “Guys to Stay Away From: Andy Evans.” Andy Evans continues to bully her. 
Melinda feels compelled to tell Rachel the truth about Andy and what happened that night. But, when Rachel learns that Andy Evans was Melinda’s attacker, she accuses Melinda of being jealous and calls her a “twisted little freak.” Later, Ivy brings Melinda into the bathroom stall. Other girls have added words like “creep” and “bastard” under Andy Evan’s name. Seeing that, Melinda feels like she can fly.
Melinda realizes she doesn’t need her burrow anymore. When she is clearing her items out of the closet, Andy Evans barges in, attacks Melinda, and tries to rape her again. She finds her voice and screams “NNNOOO!!” He does not back off, so Melinda breaks a mirror, takes a shard of glass, and holds it to his neck. “I said no,” she tells him. People who had heard her scream run for help.
With hours left in the school year, Melinda finds herself a sort of hero. She finishes her tree project, receiving an A+ from Mr. Freeman."
Restoring,"Regeneration begins with Siegfried Sassoon's open letter, dated July 1917, protesting the conduct and insincerities of the First World War. The letter has been published in the London Times and has received much attention in England, as many people are upset over the length and toll of the war thus far. The army is not sure what to do with Sassoon, as his letter clearly threatens to undermine the strength of the war effort at home.
With the string-pulling and guidance of Robert Graves, a fellow poet and friend of Sassoon, the Board agrees to send Sassoon to Craiglockhart War Hospital—a mental facility in Scotland—rather than court-marshaling him. Sassoon is at first hesitant to agree to this, since he (rightly) fears that being committed to a mental hospital will undermine his cause; however, convinced by Graves that there is no other option, Sassoon agrees.
At Craiglockhart, Sassoon meets with Dr. W.H.R. Rivers, a former anthropologist turned psychiatrist who encourages his patients to express their war memories so that they can heal their ""nerves."" Though Rivers can sympathize with the strong dislike of the horrors of war, he believes it is his duty to encourage Sassoon to return to France to fight.
There are many soldiers with various problems and ailments in the hospital. Burns, an emaciated man, has been unable to eat since a shell threw him into the gas-filled stomach of a German corpse. Anderson, a former war surgeon, is now terrified at the sight of blood, and is worried about resuming his civilian medical practice. Prior, a young, stubborn, and slightly difficult patient, enters the hospital suffering from mutism. Rivers meets with each of them in turn, helping them to recover from their problems.
One stormy night, Burns leaves the hospital, makes a trip far into the countryside, and comes across a tree with dead animals hanging from it. He is at first frightened, but he then starts removing the animals from the branches one by one and arranging them in a circle. Burns lies down in the middle of the circle, naked, and he feels soothed. Eventually, Burns returns to the hospital, but no one finds out about this episode.
Dr. Rivers is personally and emotionally tied to the welfare of his patients. One night, he has a nightmare about old nerve regeneration experiments he used to conduct with his old friend, Henry Head. At Cambridge, the two had severed a nerve in Head's hand with the purpose of charting its gradual regeneration. Rivers still feels guilty about the pain he inflicted on his friend, as well as the pain he inflicts on his patients by forcing them to talk about their war experiences.
Sassoon's letter is read in the House of Commons and is dismissed, as he is considered mentally unstable. Though Sassoon expected this result, he is still saddened and disappointed by the news. Slowly, he begins to become friends with another patient in the hospital, Wilfred Owen. Owen is also a poet and he greatly respects Sassoon's work; Sassoon agrees to help Owen with his poetry.
Prior, who has regained his voice, finds his way to a pub in Edinburgh where he meets a young munitions worker named Sarah Lumb. They strike up an acquaintance and agree to see each other again. When Prior returns to the hospital, Rivers tries hypnosis on Prior to see if it enables him to remember the tragic events that led to his breakdown. The hypnosis works, and Prior remembers in vivid detail having to shovel his men's remains after they were killed by a shell. Prior's memories anger and upset him. The next week, Prior takes Sarah to a seaside town where they see crowds of people walking on the beach. Prior envies and resents the way these people can just escape from the war. A storm comes, and Prior and Sarah make love under the shelter of a thornbush.
After a very busy day, Rivers wakes up in the middle of the night with chest pain; his doctor insists that he take three weeks vacation. During these three weeks, he visits his brother's house and reflects on his relationship with his deceased father. Rivers then visits his old friend Henry Head, who offers him a terrific job at a war hospital in London. Finally Rivers visits Burns's house in Suffolk for a few days. The Review Board has given Burns an unconditional discharge from the army. While at Suffolk, Burns has an episode and tries to commit suicide by hiding in a hole that floods at high tide. Rivers finds Burns, however, and saves him.
Back at Craiglockhart, the Board has granted Prior permanent home service; he will not have to return to the war. Prior sneaks into Sarah's room and tells her the news. Though they are both skeptical about love, they agree to give their relationship a try. Meanwhile, Sassoon has also come to a very important decision. Although he still disagrees with the brutality and suffering of the war, he decides to return to France in order to care for his men. Both Graves and Rivers are pleased with this decision.
Dr. Rivers decides to take the job in London, and leaves Craiglockhart in glory (Willard, one of his patients, has overcome his mental block and is now able to walk again). In London, Rivers is fascinated by his new work. Dr. Yealland, another psychiatrist specializing in war patients, invites Rivers to the National Hospital to come on his rounds. Rivers watches one of Yealland's horrific electro-shock therapy sessions on a patient named Callan. That night, Rivers has a nightmare that he is shoving a horse's bit into Sassoon's mouth, similar to the way Yealland shoved the electrode into the patient's mouth.
Rivers returns to Craiglockhart for a monthly Review Board meeting. The Board grants Anderson a desk position in the War Office and discharges Sassoon to duty, to return to France to fight. As Rivers says farewell to Sassoon, he realizes how much his own views about the war have changed."
Stanch,"The full title of Swift's pamphlet is ""A Modest Proposal for Preventing the Children of Poor People from Being a Burthen to their Parents, or the Country, and for Making them Beneficial to the Publick."" The tract is an ironically conceived attempt to ""find out a fair, cheap, and easy Method"" for converting the starving children of Ireland into ""sound and useful members of the Commonwealth."" Across the country poor children, predominantly Catholics, are living in squalor because their families are too poor to keep them fed and clothed.
The author argues, by hard-edged economic reasoning as well as from a self-righteous moral stance, for a way to turn this problem into its own solution. His proposal, in effect, is to fatten up these undernourished children and feed them to Ireland's rich land-owners. Children of the poor could be sold into a meat market at the age of one, he argues, thus combating overpopulation and unemployment, sparing families the expense of child-bearing while providing them with a little extra income, improving the culinary experience of the wealthy, and contributing to the overall economic well-being of the nation.
The author offers statistical support for his assertions and gives specific data about the number of children to be sold, their weight and price, and the projected consumption patterns. He suggests some recipes for preparing this delicious new meat, and he feels sure that innovative cooks will be quick to generate more. He also anticipates that the practice of selling and eating children will have positive effects on family morality: husbands will treat their wives with more respect, and parents will value their children in ways hitherto unknown. His conclusion is that the implementation of this project will do more to solve Ireland's complex social, political, and economic problems than any other measure that has been proposed."
Enforcement,"Lawyer Bryan Stevenson gives a first-person account of his decades helping marginalized Americans who have been unfairly and harshly punished by the U.S. criminal justice system, which disproportionately targets people of color and poor people. At the heart of Just Mercy is the story of Walter McMillian, a Black man who was framed for the murder of a girl named Ronda Morrison, convicted, and sent to death row. 
Stevenson alternates chapters about Walter with his personal reflections on our country’s history with racial disparity and issues around incarceration. Stevenson highlights other groups of vulnerable people who have been victimized by the criminal justice system and shares the stories of the prisoners he has helped over the years. The book also follows the growth of Stevenson’s nonprofit law project, the Alabama-based Equal Justice Initiative (EJI), through its expansion from focusing on death row prisoners to helping people sentenced to life without parole. Stevenson chronicles how EJI becomes a significant force in criminal justice reform.
In 1983 as a law student, Stevenson discovers his life’s passion when he interns with the Georgia-based Southern Prisoners Defense Committee and meets his first death row prisoner. After graduation Stevenson accepts a job with the organization to represent poor prisoners, including those in Alabama who lack any public defender. He meets Walter McMillian on Alabama’s death row. Walter owns a successful business but also transgresses racial boundaries when he has an affair with a white woman. Soon after the affair becomes public, the woman’s friend, Ralph Myers, accuses Walter of committing the unsolved murder of Ronda Morrison, which has outraged the community. Law enforcement, including a racist sheriff and the district attorney, eagerly pounces on this accusation, overlooking Walter’s alibi and a lack of evidence. Instead, they actively force Ralph to stick with his story even when he tries to recant. They coerce other false witness testimonies, and—as revealed years later—actively suppress evidence.
After Stevenson and the team at EJI unsuccessfully appeal Walter’s conviction, they launch their own investigation of the crime and uncover new evidence. They find witnesses who can prove the witnesses against Walter lied as well as financial records that indicate that one of these witnesses was paid to give false testimony. Stevenson and his team also petition for and receive all records from Walter’s trial. However, their big break comes when they receive a phone call from Ralph, who now wants to make amends. Ralph admits to lying about Walter and says he was threatened by law enforcement. Stevenson wins a hearing for Walter where he can present his new evidence: Ralph’s testimony, which is confirmed by health care workers and other inmates, as well as recordings of the law enforcement team threatening Ralph if he doesn’t frame Walter. 
While the judge refuses to grant Walter relief, Stevenson continues the appeal process through the Alabama courts. The district attorney asks outside agents to investigate the murder for which Walter was convicted, and the investigators determine that Walter had nothing to do with the crime. Six weeks later, the court invalidates Walter’s conviction. Stevenson and the State file a joint motion to dismiss the charges, and Walter is set free.
Throughout the process, Stevenson and Walter become close friends, and Stevenson helps Walter upon his release, including filing a civil suit on his behalf and offering him a place to stay. Walter works with Stevenson to share his story, giving interviews and speaking at legal conferences, and Walter is even featured in a documentary. Unfortunately, Walter is diagnosed with advancing dementia and is forced to rely on family and eventually a nursing facility for his care. He dies in 2013. Stevenson gives a eulogy at his funeral and shares all he learned from Walter, particularly that we must extend mercy to everyone, even those who have not earned it.
Interspersed with chapters chronicling Walter’s narrative are stories of Stevenson’s other clients and work. His closeness with these prisoners and their horrifying circumstances makes Stevenson more determined to help and causes him to reflect on abstract issues that nevertheless imbue the criminal justice system, like humanity and mercy. Stevenson focuses on several categories of vulnerable people who become trapped in the system, including mentally ill prisoners, disabled prisoners, and poor women who give birth to stillborn babies. 
Stevenson and his team at EJI also become increasingly focused on juvenile offenders who are sometimes tried as adults despite their young age. These offenders may be given de facto death sentences by being sentenced to life without parole and face perilous circumstances when they are housed in adult prisons. Stevenson illustrates how these prisoners retain their own humanity while being forced to live under inhumane conditions. He also discusses some of the qualities common among these types of prisoners: They are generally poor and disproportionately people of color, and most of them lack adequate legal counsel. The juveniles have horrific backgrounds of abuse and neglect.
Stevenson and his team at EJI also work to change the legal system to offer more protection to marginalized people. Several of his cases end up before the U.S. Supreme Court, and he succeeds in winning rulings that ban as unconstitutional the conviction of children to life without parole and the execution of people deemed incompetent from dementia or neurological disease. EJI works to raise public awareness of issues surrounding unfair incarceration, produces groundbreaking reports on racial issues, and sets up programs to help formerly incarcerated people adjust to life on the outside.
Stevenson also reflects on the issues that surround the criminal justice system. His time spent with prisoners awaiting their execution makes him realize how inhumane it is to prepare another human to die. After decades of work, when Stevenson fails to prevent the execution of a man who suffers from an intellectual disability, he momentarily feels unable to continue his work. However, he realizes that he cannot help but be broken by his experiences and comes to understand that it is his own brokenness that allows him to more fully understand the need for mercy and to bring compassion to others. The book ends with Stevenson’s renewed commitment to helping others."
Vibrations,"Joe Bonham lies injured in a hospital bed. While conscious, Joe thinks back over scenes from his past: the night of his father's death and the night before he left his girlfriend Kareen to go to World War I. Before his family moved to Los Angeles, Joe grew up in Shale City, a small town in Colorado. He remembers small-town memories and images, such as the food his mother would prepare, the first time an airplane came to Shale City, and the night he lost his girlfriend, Diane, to his best friend, Bill Harper.
The narrative shifts from the past to the present as Joe thinks regretfully about his decision to join a war that was not any of his business. Slowly, Joe begins to realize that he has been severely injured and treated in a hospital, which is where he currently lies. Joe gradually feels that his arms and legs have been amputated. Furthermore, he realizes that he cannot speak, see, hear, or smell because he no longer has a face—only a mask covering where his face used to be. Joe wonders bitterly abut the doctors' motivation for saving him at all.
Joe continues to live inside his head, reliving memories and terrorized by nightmares. He wonders how he can even tell whether he is awake or asleep. Joe thinks about his father kept beautiful gardens in a vacant city lot and fed his children well, although he was never officially a success because he never made any money. Joe continues to think bitterly about the foolishness of fighting and dying in a war that had nothing to do with him, and about the deceitfulness of abstract words like ""liberty,"" ""democracy,"" ""freedom,"" and ""decency.""
Time passes, and Joe tries to occupy his mind with stories, facts, and figures. One day, he realizes that he should use the skin he has left—the skin of his neck that is not covered by blankets—to try to sense the outside world. Joe develops a plan to wait for the feeling of sunrise so that he can tally the nurses' visits and count the passing of the days. A year later, Joe has accomplished his goal and counted up 365 days. He celebrates the New Year in his mind, just as he has celebrated each Sunday of his year with an imagined walk in the woods.
In Joe's fourth year, he is amazed to feel that the hospital staff is prepared him to be shown to visitors. When he feels the visitors lay something on his chest, he realizes he is being given a medal. Joe becomes angry and shudders in his bed, trying to remove his mask to show the visitors how much damage men like him sustained in the war while generals emerged unscathed. Joe feels the vibrations of the men leaving the room. An idea comes upon him that if he can sense the outside world through vibrations, perhaps he might also communicate to the outside world with vibrations. Joe begins tapping SOS in Morse code with his head, but his regular nurse assumes that he is having seizures and sedates him.
Joe awakens from his sedation to realize that he has a new day nurse. The new day nurse tries to communicate with Joe by spelling out ""MERRY CHRISTMAS"" on his chest. Joe signals with his head that he understands, and he begins trying to tap Morse code to her. After trying to appease his tapping by making him more comfortable in various ways, the nurse eventually realizes he is trying to communicate in words.
The nurse goes to get a man who understands Morse code. This man taps onto Joe's forehead the words ""WHAT DO YOU WANT?"" Joe spends some time thinking about the inappropriateness of the question and then tries to think about what in fact it is that he wants. Joe asks in Morse code to be taken around the outside world as an educational exhibit on the realities of war. The man listens to his response and returns a while later to tap into his head, ""WHAT YOU ASK IS AGAINST REGULATIONS.""
The man continues tapping other messages, but Joe is no longer paying attention. He is still trying to process this betrayal on the part of the people for whom he fought a war when he feels the hospital staff sedating him again. Joe taps the question ""why? why? why?""—wondering why they will not let him talk or acknowledge that there is still a person inside his mangled body. Joe suddenly realizes that they are afraid to let him out, to let other men see him as the ""new messiah of the battlefields."" If other men see Joe, they would no longer agree to fight in wars—especially wars ordered by the upper classes, but fought only by the lower classes of peaceful, working men."
Subdivision,"The Old Testament is a collection of thirty-nine books about the history and religion of the people of Israel. The authors of these books are unknown, and each book possesses a unique tone, style, and message. Individually, they include stories, laws, and sayings that are intended to function as models of religious and ethical conduct. Together—through hundreds of characters and detailed events—they represent a unified narrative about God and his attempt to relate to humankind by relating to a specific group of people.
The Old Testament contains four main sections: the Pentateuch, the Former Prophets (or Historical Books), the Writings, and the Latter Prophets. This study guide covers books from the first three sections.
The Pentateuch
The Pentateuch comprises the first five books of the Old Testament. It depicts a series of beginnings—the beginning of the world, of humankind, and of God’s promise to the Israelites.
Genesis, the first book, opens with God’s creation of the world. The perfect world falls into evil when humans disobey God, and the human population divides into separate nations and languages. After many generations, God speaks to a man named Abraham. God makes a promise, or covenant, with Abraham to make his descendants into a great nation and to give them a great land. Abraham shows strong faith in God, and God seals his promise with a number of signs and tests. This special covenant with God passes on to Abraham’s son, Isaac, and to his grandson, Jacob. Together, they represent the patriarchs, or fathers, of the Israelite people. Jacob’s twelve sons move to Egypt after the youngest brother, Joseph, miraculously becomes a high official in Egypt.
In the Book of Exodus, the descendants of Jacob’s children have become a vast people, but the Pharaoh of Egypt holds them in slavery. God chooses one man, Moses, to rescue the Israelites. God sends ten plagues to Egypt, and, with miraculous signs and wonders, Moses leads the people out of Egypt and across the Red Sea. They go to Mount Sinai, where God appears in a cloud of thunder over the mountain and affirms to the Israelites the promise he made to Abraham. God commands them to worship only himself, and he gives them various ethical and religious laws.
The books of Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy continue the explanation of God’s religious laws and his promises to the people. The people must keep these laws to enter and enjoy the promised land, toward which they are heading. Despite God’s presence, the Israelites complain and disobey incessantly, inciting God’s wrath. They wander the wilderness for forty years in search of the promised land. These books continue the period of Moses’s legendary leadership and miracles, until his death at the end of Deuteronomy.
The Former Prophets
The Former Prophets, or the Historical Books, cover the history of the Israelites from Moses’s death to the fall of the nation in 587 b.c. In the books of Joshua and Judges, the Israelites successfully conquer the land promised to them by God, but they disobey God by worshipping the deities of the surrounding peoples. Neighboring nations invade and oppress the Israelites. God saves the people of Israel by designating judges, or rulers, to lead the people in warding off their enemies.
The two books of Samuel (First Samuel and Second Samuel) cover the rise of the united kingdom of Israel. Israel’s religious leader, Samuel, appoints a king named Saul. Saul disobeys God, however, and God chooses another man, David, to be Israel’s king. King Saul attempts to kill the young David, but fails. Saul’s death closes the first book. In the second book, David establishes the great kingdom of Israel. He conquers Israel’s surrounding enemies and establishes Jerusalem as the religious and political center of Israel.
The books of Kings (called 1 Kings and 2 Kings) trace the decline of Israel’s success. God blesses David’s son, Solomon, with immense wisdom. As king, Solomon expands Israel into an empire and builds a great temple in Jerusalem. Solomon disobeys God by worshipping other deities, and, at his death, the kingdom splits into a northern kingdom, Israel, and a southern kingdom, Judah. A host of evil kings leads the two kingdoms away from worshipping God. Despite the attempts of the prophets Elijah and Elisha to halt Israel’s wrongdoing, the two kingdoms fall to the Assyrian and Babylonian Empires. Jerusalem is destroyed, and the people are sent into exile.
The Writings
The Writings are placed after the historical books in the Christian Bible. Some of these are narratives covering the time of Israel’s exile in other nations and its eventual return to the homeland. The Book of Esther, for example, tells the story of an unassuming Jewish girl who becomes the queen of Persia and boldly saves the Jewish people from genocide.
Many of the Writings are books of poetry and wisdom, among the most important literature in the Old Testament. The Book of Job is a lengthy dialogue investigating God’s justice and the problem of human suffering. The Psalms are lyrical poems and hymns—many attributed to King David—that express humankind’s longing for God. The books of Proverbs and Ecclesiastes—similarly attributed to the wise King Solomon—offer sayings and instructions about the meaning of life and ethical behavior. Lastly, the Song of Solomon (also attributed to Solomon) is a romantic, lyric dialogue between a young woman and her lover."

Defenseless,"A Clockwork Orange takes place in a futuristic city governed by a repressive, totalitarian super-State. In this society, ordinary citizens have fallen into a passive stupor of complacency, blind to the insidious growth of a rampant, violent youth culture. The protagonist of the story is Alex, a fifteen-year-old boy who narrates in a teenage slang called nadsat, which incorporates elements of Russian and Cockney English. Alex leads a small gang of teenage criminals—Dim, Pete, and Georgie—through the streets, robbing and beating men and raping women. Alex and his friends spend the rest of their time at the Korova Milkbar, an establishment that serves milk laced with drugs, and a bar called the Duke of New York.
Alex begins his narrative from the Korova, where the boys sit around drinking. When Alex and his gang leave the bar, they go on a crime spree that involves mugging, robbery, a gang fight, auto theft, breaking and entering, and rape. The last of these crimes is particularly brutal. The boys travel to the countryside with their stolen car, break into a cottage and beat up the man inside before raping his wife while making him watch. They then head back to the Korova, where they fight with each other. Alex, who loves classical music, becomes angry at Dim when Dim mocks an opera that Alex likes. Alex punches Dim in the face, which prompts the others to turn against their arrogant leader. The next time they go out, they break into an old woman’s house. She calls the police, and before Alex can get away, Dim hits him in the eye with a chain and runs away with the others. The police apprehend Alex and take him to the station, where he later learns that the woman he beat and raped during the earlier robbery has died. 
Alex is sentenced to fourteen years in prison. At first, prison is difficult for him. The guards are merciless and oppressive, and several of the other prisoners want to rape him. After a few years, though, prison life becomes easier. He befriends the prison chaplain, who notices Alex’s interest in the Bible. The chaplain lets Alex read in the chapel while listening to classical music, and Alex pores over the Old Testament, delighting in the sex, drinking, and fighting he finds in its pages. 
One day, after fighting with and killing a cellmate, Alex is selected as the first candidate for an experimental treatment called Ludovico’s Technique, a form of brainwashing that incorporates associative learning. After being injected with a substance that makes him dreadfully sick, the doctors force Alex to watch exceedingly violent movies. In this way, Alex comes to associate violence with the nausea and headaches he experiences from the shot. The process takes two weeks to complete, after which the mere thought of violence has the power to make Alex ill. As an unintended consequence of the treatment, Alex can no longer enjoy classical music, which he has always associated with violence. This side effect doesn’t bother the State, which considers Alex’s successful treatment a victory for law and order and plans to implement it on a large scale.
After two years in prison, Alex is released, a harmless human being incapable of vicious acts. Soon, however, Alex finds he’s not only harmless but also defenseless, as his earlier victims begin to take revenge on him. His old friend Dim and an old enemy named Billyboy are both police officers now, and they take the opportunity to settle old scores. They drive him to a field in the country, beat him, and leave him in the rain. Looking for charity, Alex wanders to a nearby cottage and knocks on the door, begging for help. The man living there lets him in and gives him food and a room for the night. Alex recognizes him from two years ago as the man whose wife he raped, but the man does not recognize Alex, who wore a mask that night. Alex learns later in the night that the man’s wife died of shock shortly after being raped. 
This man, F. Alexander, is a political dissident. When he hears Alex’s story, he thinks he can use Alex to incite public outrage against the State. He and three of his colleagues develop a plan for Alex to make several public appearances. Alex, however, is tired of being exploited for other people’s schemes. He berates the men in nadsat, which arouses the suspicion of F. Alexander, who still remembers the strange language spoken by the teenagers who raped his wife. Based on F. Alexander’s suspicion, the men change their plans. They lock Alex in an apartment and blast classical music through the wall, hoping to drive Alex to suicide so they can blame the government. 
Alex does, in fact, hurl himself out of an attic window, but the fall doesn’t kill him. While he lies in the hospital, unconscious, a political struggle ensues, but the current administration survives. State doctors undo Ludovico’s Technique and restore Alex’s old vicious self in exchange for Alex’s endorsement. Back to normal, Alex assembles a new gang and engages in the same behavior as he did before prison, but he soon begins to tire of a life of violence. After running into his old friend Pete, who is now married and living a normal life, Alex decides that such a life is what he wants for himself. His final thoughts are of his future son."
Opportunity,"In Outliers: The Story of Success, Malcolm Gladwell considers the circumstances that lead to success. The first half of the book looks closely at how opportunities matter more in the lives of successful people than hard work or raw talent. The second half of the book focuses on cultural legacies: behavioral tendencies rooted in their ancestral past.
Part One examines the role of opportunity in the lives of extremely successful people. Gladwell’s first example is the Canadian Hockey League, the world’s most competitive youth hockey league. Since the cutoff date for the Canadian leagues that serve the youngest players is January 1, those born in the first part of the calendar year are much larger and more coordinated than their peers. The larger and more coordinated kids are given more playing time and better coaching, and thus become better players by the time they reach the top league. An overwhelming majority of Canadian professional hockey players have birthdays in January, February or March.
Gladwell proposes that 10,000 hours of practice is needed to master a skill, even for prodigies like Mozart. Bill Joy, Bill Gates, and the Beatles all worked hard to achieve success but benefited from opportunities they did not create. Joy, one of the founders of Sun Microsystems, happened to attend one of the first colleges in the world with a time-sharing terminal. In graduate school, he had a terminal in his room, where he spent all of his free time programming. Gates happened to attend a private high school with a time-sharing terminal connected to a mainframe in Seattle. He also was able to spend all of his free time programming. Early on, the Beatles were hired to play long shows day after day in Hamburg, Germany. 
Birth year or era is another form of opportunity. Gates and Joy (as well as other early programmers) all reached the end of their teen years just as personal computers became available to the public. In another example, fourteen of the top seventy-five richest people in the history of the world happened to be alive at the same time, in the same country: the United States in the mid-1800s.
Opportunity matters more than an individual’s IQ. Using a study conducted by Lewis Terman, the creator of the Stanford-Binet IQ test, Gladwell shows that “practical intelligence” is as important as “analytical intelligence.” He also contrasts Chris Langan, one of the world’s smartest living people, with Robert Oppenheimer. While both had difficulties in college, only Oppenheimer had a successful life, due to his practical intelligence.
The last portion of Part One looks at Joe Flom, a successful lawyer from New York City. While he was born into a poor family to Jewish immigrants (in a time when Jewish immigrants were not treated well), many of the disadvantages in his life were actually benefits and directly contributed to his success.
Part Two investigates cultural legacies. Using flight recorder transcripts from several plane crashes from the last few decades, Gladwell shows that cultural expectations and habits can be a severe hindrance to pilots. Copilots from countries that have a high “Power Distance Index” (those that show the most deference to authority) will often avoid telling pilots that they are making mistakes, even when the mistakes are potentially fatal. After recognizing the dangers of such cultural expectations, commercial aviation has instituted programs to change the way flight crews talk with one another. 
Gladwell next analyzes the disparity in public school math test scores between Eastern and Western countries. He suggests that the cultures in which rice paddy farming is historically important have a stronger work ethic. Using various examples, Gladwell shows that hard work has a greater impact on success in learning mathematics than intelligence. 
The final example is an examination of the KIPP school in the South Bronx and the “achievement gap” between socioeconomic groups. American students from middle-class and affluent households retain more information over summer vacation and are more likely to make additional gains than students from low-income households. The KIPP school uses longer school days and summer programming to eliminate the achievement gap for low-income children. While the work schedule is very rigorous, the school’s students go on to great academic success.
Gladwell demonstrates that if more opportunities were available, there would be far more successful people and the world would be richer for it."
Insufficient,"Lawyer Bryan Stevenson gives a first-person account of his decades helping marginalized Americans who have been unfairly and harshly punished by the U.S. criminal justice system, which disproportionately targets people of color and poor people. At the heart of Just Mercy is the story of Walter McMillian, a Black man who was framed for the murder of a girl named Ronda Morrison, convicted, and sent to death row. 
Stevenson alternates chapters about Walter with his personal reflections on our country’s history with racial disparity and issues around incarceration. Stevenson highlights other groups of vulnerable people who have been victimized by the criminal justice system and shares the stories of the prisoners he has helped over the years. The book also follows the growth of Stevenson’s nonprofit law project, the Alabama-based Equal Justice Initiative (EJI), through its expansion from focusing on death row prisoners to helping people sentenced to life without parole. Stevenson chronicles how EJI becomes a significant force in criminal justice reform.
In 1983 as a law student, Stevenson discovers his life’s passion when he interns with the Georgia-based Southern Prisoners Defense Committee and meets his first death row prisoner. After graduation Stevenson accepts a job with the organization to represent poor prisoners, including those in Alabama who lack any public defender. He meets Walter McMillian on Alabama’s death row. Walter owns a successful business but also transgresses racial boundaries when he has an affair with a white woman. Soon after the affair becomes public, the woman’s friend, Ralph Myers, accuses Walter of committing the unsolved murder of Ronda Morrison, which has outraged the community. Law enforcement, including a racist sheriff and the district attorney, eagerly pounces on this accusation, overlooking Walter’s alibi and a lack of evidence. Instead, they actively force Ralph to stick with his story even when he tries to recant. They coerce other false witness testimonies, and—as revealed years later—actively suppress evidence.
After Stevenson and the team at EJI unsuccessfully appeal Walter’s conviction, they launch their own investigation of the crime and uncover new evidence. They find witnesses who can prove the witnesses against Walter lied as well as financial records that indicate that one of these witnesses was paid to give false testimony. Stevenson and his team also petition for and receive all records from Walter’s trial. However, their big break comes when they receive a phone call from Ralph, who now wants to make amends. Ralph admits to lying about Walter and says he was threatened by law enforcement. Stevenson wins a hearing for Walter where he can present his new evidence: Ralph’s testimony, which is confirmed by health care workers and other inmates, as well as recordings of the law enforcement team threatening Ralph if he doesn’t frame Walter. 
While the judge refuses to grant Walter relief, Stevenson continues the appeal process through the Alabama courts. The district attorney asks outside agents to investigate the murder for which Walter was convicted, and the investigators determine that Walter had nothing to do with the crime. Six weeks later, the court invalidates Walter’s conviction. Stevenson and the State file a joint motion to dismiss the charges, and Walter is set free.
Throughout the process, Stevenson and Walter become close friends, and Stevenson helps Walter upon his release, including filing a civil suit on his behalf and offering him a place to stay. Walter works with Stevenson to share his story, giving interviews and speaking at legal conferences, and Walter is even featured in a documentary. Unfortunately, Walter is diagnosed with advancing dementia and is forced to rely on family and eventually a nursing facility for his care. He dies in 2013. Stevenson gives a eulogy at his funeral and shares all he learned from Walter, particularly that we must extend mercy to everyone, even those who have not earned it.
Interspersed with chapters chronicling Walter’s narrative are stories of Stevenson’s other clients and work. His closeness with these prisoners and their horrifying circumstances makes Stevenson more determined to help and causes him to reflect on abstract issues that nevertheless imbue the criminal justice system, like humanity and mercy. Stevenson focuses on several categories of vulnerable people who become trapped in the system, including mentally ill prisoners, disabled prisoners, and poor women who give birth to stillborn babies. 
Stevenson and his team at EJI also become increasingly focused on juvenile offenders who are sometimes tried as adults despite their young age. These offenders may be given de facto death sentences by being sentenced to life without parole and face perilous circumstances when they are housed in adult prisons. Stevenson illustrates how these prisoners retain their own humanity while being forced to live under inhumane conditions. He also discusses some of the qualities common among these types of prisoners: They are generally poor and disproportionately people of color, and most of them lack adequate legal counsel. The juveniles have horrific backgrounds of abuse and neglect.
Stevenson and his team at EJI also work to change the legal system to offer more protection to marginalized people. Several of his cases end up before the U.S. Supreme Court, and he succeeds in winning rulings that ban as unconstitutional the conviction of children to life without parole and the execution of people deemed incompetent from dementia or neurological disease. EJI works to raise public awareness of issues surrounding unfair incarceration, produces groundbreaking reports on racial issues, and sets up programs to help formerly incarcerated people adjust to life on the outside.
Stevenson also reflects on the issues that surround the criminal justice system. His time spent with prisoners awaiting their execution makes him realize how inhumane it is to prepare another human to die. After decades of work, when Stevenson fails to prevent the execution of a man who suffers from an intellectual disability, he momentarily feels unable to continue his work. However, he realizes that he cannot help but be broken by his experiences and comes to understand that it is his own brokenness that allows him to more fully understand the need for mercy and to bring compassion to others. The book ends with Stevenson’s renewed commitment to helping others."
Grant,"Grant Wiggins has been teaching on a plantation outside Bayonne, Louisiana, for several years when a slow-witted man named Jefferson is convicted of murder and sentenced to death. Jefferson claims he is innocent of the crime. He says he was on his way to a bar, but changed his mind and decided to tag along with two men who were on their way to a liquor store. Upon arriving there, the two men began arguing with the storeowner, and a shootout ensued. The storeowner and the two men died, and Jefferson remained at the scene of the crime. He was arrested and tried for murder. Jefferson’s lawyer argues in court that Jefferson is nothing but a poor fool, hardly more worthwhile than a hog, and therefore incapable of plotting such a scheme. The jury quickly brings back a guilty verdict.
	Upon hearing the lawyer’s speech, Jefferson’s godmother, Miss Emma, resolves to help Jefferson die like a man, not a hog. She asks Grant to help her, knowing that he will resist. Grant left many years prior to attend college, and he returned an educated man. He deplores the injustices done to his fellow black men, but he does not want to get involved in Jefferson’s case. However, after considerable pressure from his aunt, Tante Lou, he agrees to try to help Jefferson. Grant, Miss Emma, and Grant’s aunt go to visit Jefferson in his cell, and they discover that he too heard the lawyer’s words and has taken them to heart. Silent and moody, Jefferson resists Grant’s feeble attempts to reach him. The three visitors spend an uncomfortable hour in the cell and then leave.
	During the next few visits, Jefferson continues to frustrate Grant’s attempts to communicate. When Grant attempts to teach Jefferson about dignity, Jefferson insists that dignity is for “youmans,” not hogs. He eats and snuffles in imitation of a hog and tries to anger Grant with stubbornness and malice, but Grant maintains his patience. Each hour-long visit ends in failure, but Grant continues to try to reach Jefferson. On his fourth visit, Grant sparks a conversation with Jefferson about his final meal. Jefferson admits that he wants a gallon of vanilla ice cream because, although he loves ice cream, he has never had more than a thimbleful at a time. This admission begins to break down the barrier between the two men. Grant borrows money from some townspeople and buys Jefferson a small radio. On his next visit, he brings Jefferson a notebook and asks him to write down whatever thoughts come to his mind. Jefferson promises to do so, and by Grant’s next visit, Jefferson has filled most of a page with thoughts concerning the difference between hogs and men.
	Grant’s relationships with his girlfriend Vivian and with Reverend Ambrose begin to intensify. Despite her love for Grant, Vivian dislikes his tendency to think only of himself, showing little regard for her needs. Grant uses Vivian to escape the troubles of his life, and he continually suggests that they run away from their hometown and their past in the South. The Reverend Ambrose, himself unable to reach Jefferson, urges Grant to put aside his atheistic beliefs and help save not just Jefferson’s character, but his soul. The Reverend declares that Grant must learn to tell lies for the good of others.
	Grant focuses his energy on Jefferson and tries to explain the importance of Jefferson’s death. Jefferson asks Grant if he believes in heaven and Grant replies that he does not, although he qualifies this remark by saying that his atheism does not make him a good man. In fact, Grant says, Jefferson will save even Grant’s atheistic soul if he carries the cross for the sinners on earth. Grant explains that the black community in the quarter has spent centuries enslaved to white men, and that when Jefferson’s attorney called him a hog, he attacked the will and intelligence of the entire black society. In consequence, Jefferson now has the opportunity to stand up for his community. He has become a symbol to his people, and the manner in which he faces his death will bear on their self--confidence and potential.
	Over the next few weeks, Jefferson continues to write in his journal. In March, the governor of Louisiana sets the execution date for two weeks after Easter. As news of Jefferson’s impending death spreads through the town, more and more people begin to visit him. Young children and old men, strangers and friends, all come to -Jefferson’s cell to speak to him. The onslaught of attention makes Jefferson begin to understand the enormity of the task that Grant has given him. He realizes that he has become much more than an ordinary man and that his death will represent much more than an ordinary death. Elated by Jefferson’s progress, Grant nevertheless dreads the execution day, when that progress will be tested.
	Grant cannot bring himself to attend the execution, for he has grown very close to Jefferson. At the time the execution is scheduled to take place, he orders his students to kneel by their desks in honor of Jefferson. He steps outside the classroom, distressed and bewildered. He knows he should have attended the execution. A few minutes later, a deputy comes down from the courthouse and informs Grant that the execution is over. He assures Grant that Jefferson was the bravest man in the room that morning. Grant looks out over the town, numb and heavyhearted, and discovers that he is crying."
Action,"A Raisin in the Sun portrays a few weeks in the life of the Youngers, a Black family living on the South Side of Chicago in the 1950s. When the play opens, the Youngers are about to receive an insurance check for $10,000. This money comes from the deceased Mr. Younger’s life insurance policy. Each of the adult members of the family has an idea as to what he or she would like to do with this money. The matriarch of the family, Mama, wants to buy a house to fulfill a dream she shared with her husband. Mama’s son, Walter Lee, would rather use the money to invest in a liquor store with his friends. He believes that the investment will solve the family’s financial problems forever. Walter’s wife, Ruth, agrees with Mama, however, and hopes that she and Walter can provide more space and opportunity for their son, Travis. Finally, Beneatha, Walter’s sister and Mama’s daughter, wants to use the money for her medical school tuition. She also wishes that her family members were not so interested in assimilating into the white world. Beneatha instead tries to find her identity by looking back to the past and to Africa.
As the play progresses, the Youngers clash over their competing dreams. Ruth discovers that she is pregnant but fears that if she has the child, she will put more financial pressure on her family members. When Walter says nothing to Ruth’s admission that she is considering abortion, Mama puts a down payment on a house for the whole family. She believes that a bigger, brighter dwelling will help them all. This house is in Clybourne Park, an entirely white neighborhood. When the Youngers’ future neighbors find out that the Youngers are moving in, they send Mr. Lindner, from the Clybourne Park Improvement Association, to offer the Youngers money in return for staying away. The Youngers refuse the deal, even after Walter loses the rest of the money ($6,500) to his friend Willy Harris, who persuades Walter to invest in the liquor store and then runs off with his cash.
In the meantime, Beneatha rejects her suitor, George Murchison, whom she believes to be shallow and blind to the problems of race. Subsequently, she receives a marriage proposal from her Nigerian boyfriend, Joseph Asagai, who wants Beneatha to get a medical degree and move to Africa with him (Beneatha does not make her choice before the end of the play). The Youngers eventually move out of the apartment, fulfilling the family’s long-held dream. Their future seems uncertain and slightly dangerous, but they are optimistic and determined to live a better life. They believe that they can succeed if they stick together as a family and resolve to defer their dreams no longer."
Openly,"Marjane “Marji” Satrapi is an intelligent, spirited, and very modern girl living with her parents in Iran’s capital of Tehran during the eventful period of Iranian history from the late 1970s into the early 1980s. In Persepolis: The Story of a Childhood, Marji’s remembers her life during those years, mostly from when she was about ten to age fourteen. This account includes how Marji and her family lived through and were affected by turbulent events that included the overthrow of the autocratic Shah of Iran by the Islamic revolution, the oppressive fundamentalist regime that replaced the Shah, and the devasting Iran-Iraq war.
The nation’s wealth has long made it a target of outside invaders, but Islamic revolution of 1979 has pushed out the Western-backed government of the Shah.  The revolution has ushered in a new Islamic regime that is bringing massive societal changes impacting how people are supposed to behave--including Marji and her family. Marji struggles to adjust to the changes at her liberal French bilingual school, which has become increasingly stricter. Girls are required to wear veils and female and male students are now separated. Marji’s wealthy and modern parents—her father, Ebi, and her mother, Taji—take part in the massive protests against the new regime’s strict rules on behavior (just as they had previously protested against the Shah’s regime). Marji’s parents worry when a photo of Marji’s mother a protest appears in newspapers magazines. Later, after a demonstration they are at turns violent, the Satrapis decide that openly protesting is too dangerous to continue to do.
Marji feels conflict between her own deeply spiritual feelings and the stark modernism of her parents. She talks to God at night and has believed she will become a prophet one day since she was six years old, Marji. But the revolution leads to Marji setting aside these ambitions while she studies and imitates protestors and revolutionaries. She mimics protestors in the garden of her house and studies books about famous revolutionaries and philosophers given to her by her parents. She fantasizes about becoming a hero and wants her parents to become heroes too. Marji’s relationship with God becomes strained, as she finds that she and God have less to talk about—although God does still come by to see her from time to time.
Marji thrills when she learns that rebels fill her family history. She learns that her grandfather was a prince and later a communist whom the Shah removed from power and that her uncle Anoosh, also a communist, spent nine years in prison during the Shah’s regime. Marji spends a short time with Anoosh, learning about his life. After the Shah fell from power in 1979, Anoosh was released from prison, but when Islamic fundamentalists consolidate their grip on power, they hunt Anoosh down, imprison him, and later execute him. Her new idol killed, Marji feels crushed. She completely abandons her faith in God and increasingly questions the pro-regime propaganda she hears—especially at school.
Marji deeply loves and identifies with of her parents, even if she does sometimes feel that their actions and behavior (as wealthy and privileged individuals) do not always live up to their pro-democratic and liberal rhetoric. Marji also has a special connection with her grandmother, who remains stoic and inspiring to Marji in spite of the turmoil and numerous tragedies stemming from political actions that impact her and the family. Marji’s uncle Anoosh is not Marji’s only direct experience with the cruel consequences of the government’s actions. Throughout the book, death and devastation occurs among Marji’s extended family and friends as direct results of the brutality and fanaticism of the Iranian regimes and the war with Iraq.
People had rejoiced when the Shah was forced out, but as Islamic fundamentalists retain power, Marji and her family watch as their neighbors’ behavior shifts back and forth to coincide with the current political winds. The neighbors go from wearing short skirts and drinking alcohol to covering themselves and denouncing the use of alcohol. Marji’s parents ask her to tell everyone that she prays every day, a lie they hope will keep Marji safe, but acknowledge that the rules seem foolish. Marji grows more rebellious, as she increasingly views the rules at school and elsewhere as hypocritical and difficult to follow. Armed with more knowledge and personal experience, Marji begins to act out in ways that put her safety at risk. In fact, she even (accidentally) hits her principal during an argument, which results in her expulsion from school. Fearing her rebellious behavior will get her killed, Marji’s mother tries to reason with Marji by telling her that it is not her responsibility to serve justice and that the bad guys eventually pay for their sins in the end.
The war with Iraq had originally inspired Marji to vocal patriotism in protection her country against another invasion, but Marji begins to realize there are greater forces behind the war. She sees how the Islamic regime needs the war to continue survive and keep power. The war promotes a sense of nationalism and pride in the public, and those who die in the war are hailed as “martyrs.” Marji sees thousands of poor boys lured into war without proper training. She becomes increasingly uncomfortable and aware of class differences within society. Poor young boys are lured into the army with gold-painted keys to the “kingdom of heaven” to help them enter paradise after dying on the battlefield, while children in her wealthy neighborhood are left alone.
More and more people try to escape Iran as the borders tighten and Iraqi forces bomb Tehran and other Iranian cities. Realizing that Marji’s chances of escaping Iran are narrowing, her parents make the difficult decision to send her abroad alone to finish school in Vienna, explaining that only a good education will free her of Iran. Marji feels heartbroken. She spends one last night with her grandmother, who gives her warm advice and inspires her to be compassionate and understanding while in Vienna. Marji gives away all of her prized contraband to her friends, including a Kim Wilde poster. At the airport, as Marji turns to say goodbye to her parents one last time to see that her mother, devasted by her only child’s departure, has fainted."
Reasons,"Clay Jensen is a diligent high school student. He is close to being class valedictorian and almost always chooses to study on weekends instead of going to parties. Clay’s classmate, Hannah Baker, has recently taken her own life. After Hannah’s suicide, Clay receives a package in the mail with no return address. When he opens it, he a shoebox containing seven two-sided audio cassettes with the A and B sides numbered in sequential order.
We learn that the tapes were recorded by Hannah just prior taking her own life, and that on thirteen of the fourteen sides she described troubling events leading up to her suicide. Thirteen Reasons Why follows Clay as he travels around town, with the aid of a map that Hannah created, listening to Hannah’s voiceover as she describes the events (one per tape side) and the key individuals involved in them—all of whom Hannah holds culpable in some way for her decision to take her own life. Clay, who was not close friends with Hannah, is initially puzzled about why he was sent the tapes, but as he listens to more and more of her disturbing stories, he belatedly begins to understand that he had an important place in Hannah’s world and psyche. 
Clay listens to the first tape on an old stereo his family’s garage. He hears Hannah say that she will explain why she took her own life, but that anyone listening to the tapes is one of the reasons she did so. Hannah says that whoever receives the tapes should listen to them and then send them on to the next person listed. She warns that if anyone either tries to avoid listening to the tapes or doesn’t pass them on, a backup set of the tapes will be released. In addition to the tapes, each recipient has received a map with different places marked, so that they can travel around town to each location mentioned in Hannah’s story.
On Cassette 1, Side A, Hannah tells of dating Justin Foley, who was her first kiss. They dated for a month, but when rumors started to circulate (some of them originating with Justin), Hannah gained a reputation for being promiscuous. Hannah addresses this on the tape with the statement, “Hannah Baker is not, and never was, a slut.” Realizing he’ll need way to listen to the rest of the tapes as he travels around town, Clay goes to his friend Tony’s house to get a Walkman. 
After leaving Tony’s, Clay listens to Cassette 1, Side B. On it, Hannah discusses Alex Standall. Hannah, Alex and a girl named Jessica Davis became friends and started spending time at Monet’s, a local coffee shop. After Jessica and Alex had an unpleasant breakup, Alex made a “Who’s Hot / Who’s Not” list and passed it around school. Trying to make Jessica angry, Alex listed Hannah as “Best Ass in the Freshman Class” and listed Jessica as the worst. Shortly afterwards, a student came up behind Hannah and spanked as she was standing in line at a store. With the promiscuity rumors already circulating, Hannah believes that Alex’s list gave the student an excuse for his behavior.
Clay sits on the curb outside the store where the incident occurred and plays the next tape, Cassette 2, Side A. Hannah describes her friendship with Jessica Davis. After the “Who’s Hot / Who’s Not” list started to circulate through school, Jessica confronted Hannah, stating that the promiscuity rumors must be true, and that Hannah had been involved with Alex. Hannah tried to explain that Alex put their names on his list just to make Jessica jealous, but Jessica became angry and struck Hannah, leaving a small scar above her eyebrow. Clay takes a city bus to Monet’s and orders a coffee.
At Monet’s, Clay listens to Cassette 2, Side B. Hannah talks about a yearbook photographer, Tyler Down, who secretly took pictures of her from outside her bedroom window. Hannah asked a fellow classmate, Courtney Crimsen, to help her catch this Peeping Tom in the act. In Hannah’s room, she and Courtney talk loudly and provocatively to entice the photographer, and then run to the window and see someone who Hannah later confirms is Tyler. Hannah has recorded this tape while standing outside Tyler’s window, and she marks his address on the map so others can invade his privacy, just like he invaded hers.
While taking another bus to get to Tyler’s house, Clay sees that a fellow student, Skye Miller, is also aboard. He had a crush on her in eighth grade, but Clay says that at some point Skye stopped talking to other students. Exiting the bus, Clay sees that Tyler’s window has been broken. On Cassette 3, Side A, Hannah talks about Courtney Crimsen, who everyone assumes is a good person. Hannah gives examples of how Courtney manipulates people and is quite fake. After giving Courtney a ride to a party, she even tried to start new rumors about Hannah.
On Cassette 3, Side B, Hannah describes going on a date with Marcus Cooley at Rosie’s, a local diner. While sitting in a booth, Marcus put his hand on Hannah’s thigh. After he refused to remove his hand, Hannah shoved him out of the booth. He loudly called her a “tease” and left. 
Clay thinks about how he and Hannah used to work at the local movie theater together. He had feelings for her but couldn’t bring himself to tell her because he was worried what people would think about him given Hannah’s reputation. 
Clay walks to Rosie’s Diner. On Cassette 4, Side A, Hannah tells how Zach Dempsey interfered with her life. In Mrs. Baker’s Peer Communications class, each student had a paper bag in which other students could leave anonymous compliments. After realizing that she was no longer receiving compliments, Hannah caught Zach stealing them. Hannah understood that Zach’s actions were childish, but says that this was a time in her life when she needed encouragement. Hannah then left a note in Mrs. Baker’s paper bag requesting a class discussion topic. On the note, Hannah said that she was contemplating suicide. Hannah was hurt when many students voiced annoyance over the topic and the anonymous student who’d suggested it.
Still at Rosie’s, Clay listens to Cassette 4, Side B. Hannah talks about Ryan Shaver, the editor of a school publication called the Lost-N-Found Gazette. She and Ryan met at a poetry group and got along. Ryan published one of Hannah’s poems in the Lost-N-Found Gazette without her permission. While he did not put her name on it, some students guessed who wrote it and made fun of her. Hannah felt as though her thoughts and feelings were offered up for ridicule.
When Clay leaves the diner, Tony is waiting and tells Clay to get in his car. Tony explains that he has the second set of tapes and that he’s been making sure that everyone on the list listens to them and passes them on. 
Clay listens to Cassette 5, Side A—the tape about him. Hannah talks about the time she and Clay connected at a party, eventually kissing in an unoccupied bedroom. But Hannah, exhausted from the stress of her life, freaked out and told Clay to leave, which he did.
Tony drives through different neighborhoods while Clay listens to Cassette 5, Side B. Hannah continues her story of the party, from the moment after Clay left. While hiding in a closet, she heard Bryce Walker sexually assault Jessica Davis, who was passed out on the nearby bed. The tape is actually dedicated to Justin Foley, though, because he left Jessica in the room and let Bryce in, knowing what Bryce would do.
Disgusted by what he’s heard, Clay leaves Tony’s car and starts walking. On Cassette 6, Side A, Hannah tells of leaving the party where the assault occurred with Jenny Kurtz. While driving Hannah home, Jenny ran over a stop sign. Hannah thought that they should tell the police, but Jenny didn’t want to get in trouble, so she drove off, leaving Hannah to walk home. Later that night, there was an accident at that intersection in which a student from Hannah and Clay’s school was killed. 
Clay listens to Cassette 6, Side B, in which Hannah tells a story about giving up on herself. Late at night, Hannah walked past a house where a party was winding down. Bryce Walker asked Hannah to join him in a hot tub. Hannah knew that it was a terrible idea but stripped down to her underwear and got in anyway. Bryce put his hands in Hannah’s underwear, despite Hannah turning away from him and crying. On the tape, she states that she never told him “no,” and that she was just using him to let go of life completely. 
On Cassette 7, Side A, Clay listens to a conversation that Hannah had recorded between herself and her school guidance counselor, Mr. Porter. She tells Mr. Porter that she is considering suicide, and he tries to help her, but the conversation only angers Hannah. When she leaves his office, he doesn’t pursue her. 
The next morning, Clay mails the tapes to Jenny Kurtz, who is next on the list. When he goes to school, he sees Skye Miller, the girl from the bus who stopped talking to other people. Clay runs after her and talks to her."
Dedicated,"Kidnapped tells the story of David Balfour, a young man of the Lowlands, the southern part of Scotland. David's father, Alexander Balfour, has recently died, and his mother died some time before, so he is now an orphan. Since he is now seventeen years old, he has decided it is time to go and seek his fortune. Before he leaves for the city of Edinburgh, he meets with his guardian, Mr. Campbell. Campbell reveals that David has an uncle, Ebenezer Balfour, of the House of Shaws—meaning that David is, to his surprise, from a wealthy family. David decides to go to Cramond, where his uncle lives, and meet his wealthy relatives.
David walks two days to Edinburgh, and soon finds his way to Cramond. As he begins to ask about the House of Shaws, he finds it is an unpopular place. His Uncle Ebenezer seems particularly ill regarded by the community, and is in fact the only occupant of the house. Nevertheless, David continues on to the House of Shaws. Ebenezer gives him a cold welcome, and seems very interested in the death of David's father. Ebenezer treats David badly, almost as if David were a thief, but he wins some of David's respect by giving the lad nearly forty pounds. But when Ebenezer nearly sends David to his death in the tower adjacent to the house, David demands to know why his uncle hates him and, if he does, why he wants him to stay at the House of Shaws.
A cabin boy, Ransome, arrives at the House of Shaws. He has been sent by Captain Hoseason of the Covenant, a ship that deals with some of Ebenezer's financial ventures. Hoseason has requested to see Ebenezer, so the old man decides to go to the port of Queensferry with Ransome and David. David is interested in seeing the ships at the port, so he willingly goes along. At first, Hoseason seems very pleasant. He even warns David that Ebenezer means mischief toward him. Hoseason then asks to speak to David on the boat, and David agrees, being interested in seeing more of the boat. Once he is on, however, the boat swiftly departs, and as he screams at the dock for help, the sailors knock David unconscious.
He awakes in the dark storage deck of the Covenant. As he drifts in and out of sleep, he quickly becomes ill, and soon he is lingering near death. The ship's mate, Riach, demands that the boy be allowed to sleep in the healthier forecastle of the ship with the other sailors. Hoseason reluctantly agrees, and as David recovers he becomes friends with Riach and a few of the other sailors. Then, Ransome is accidentally killed by Mr. Shuan, and David becomes the new cabin boy.
After a few days at this new job, the Covenant strikes and sinks another boat. One man survives, a strange Highland man dressed in the clothing of a French soldier. The stranger tells the captain that he is carrying the rent money for his disenfranchised chieftain. The two men make an agreement that Hoseason will drop the stranger off in Linnhe Loch, but no sooner is the captain gone from the Round-House—the officers' lounge where the visiting stranger is kept—when David overhears the officers plotting to murder the stranger and take his belt. David tells this to the stranger, and agrees to fight by his side. The stranger says his name is Alan Breck Stewart. Alan and David successfully defend the Round-House from the sailors, Alan killing several men and even David taking two himself. Alan, impressed with David's courage, gives David a silver button from his coat. The captain and Alan negotiate, and the captain agrees to drop Alan and David off near Linnhe Loch.
On the way, however, the ship strikes the Torran Rocks and goes down. David escapes and finds himself on an island. The island is separated from a larger main island only by a river, but he can find no way to cross the river. After a few days, a fisherman comes in a boat and reveals to him that the river gets very low at high tide, and David crosses easily.
David then stays at a house, and discovers that Alan himself passed through, having survived the wreck. Alan left instructions that David should follow him to Torosay, and from there go to Alan's homeland of Appin. David heads this way, meeting several disreputable people along the way, including a notorious blind robber; but the young man manages to avoid any great dangers. He meets a pleasant old religious instructor, Henderland, who helps David secure a boat to take him to Appin.
As soon as David arrives in Appin, he comes across a group of four men on horseback. One of the men is Colin Campbell, the King's Regent for that area, whose clan, the Campbells, are hated by Alan and his Stewart clan. As David speaks with Campbell, he is suddenly shot and killed by an unknown assailant. One of the people in Campbell's party accuses David of distracting Campbell so that he could be shot, and just as soldiers are about to apprehend David he is pulled away by Alan, who has been fishing nearby.
Alan and David, now major suspects in the murder, flee to the woods. Alan swears he had nothing to do with the murder, but he must now draw attention away from the real killer. David believes Alan, and they escape to the home of James Stewart, or James of the Glens. James gives them a change of clothes and some little money, but he tells them that he will have to blame them for the murder and put our warrants for their arrest once they are safely gone, so that he will not be blamed for the murder. If James is killed, it will mean great difficulties for the Stewart clan. David and Alan agree to be the scapegoats, and Alan and David are soon fleeing through the wilderness once more.
They hide for a whole day on top of a large rock while English soldiers roam around below, searching for them. They escape and go to a mountain where they rest for several days and send word to James, hoping to get a little more money so that Alan can escape to France. The messenger returns with a note from James' wife; James has been arrested for the murder. She also sends a little more money for David and Alan.
The two continue on their flight, soon reaching the broad, flat region known as the moors. They take some time out to rest, but David oversleeps on his watch, and a troop of English soldiers nearly takes them by surprise. They must run through the wide, flat land on their hands and knees, hiding in small brush and behind rocks. They manage to escape and are ambushed by Highland men who, fortunately, turn out to be men of Cluny Macpherson, another disenfranchised Highland leader. Cluny takes them in his hideout in the mountain of Ben Alder, and while David sleeps for nearly three days, Alan and Cluny play cards. Alan gambles away all their money, including David's. Cluny agrees to give them their money back, plus more, but Cluny is mortified that they thought he would keep the money, David is angry that Alan gambled it away and he has to swallow his pride and ask for it back, and Alan feels guilty for having gambled it all away.
Alan and David continue on their journey toward the Lowlands, but David is now angry and bitter toward Alan. Alan feels remorseful for some time, but when David refuses to warm up at all, Alan thinks that he has personally suffered enough, and soon becomes his usual happy self, taunting David for being a Whig. Alan is a Jacobite, someone who believed the Stuarts, a Highland clan, should be on the throne, whereas Whigs were supporters of the current English monarchy, following the line of William and Mary. David's patience wears thin, and he viciously attacks Alan's honor. Realizing he cannot be forgiven for what he said, David pretends that he is about to die of exhaustion, and Alan becomes very worried and takes David to a house.
Over the course of a month, David recovers. There is some brief trouble when Alan meets Robin Oig, one of the sons of the well-known Highlander Rob Roy Macgregor, who was also a Campbell. But instead of using guns, they duel by playing the bagpipes, and the two men quickly respect one another and a crisis is averted.
David and Alan finally move on and, after some difficulties, reach Queensferry once more. They cross over and David meets with his family's lawyer, Mr. Rankeillor. Rankeillor believes his story, but David's uncle Ebenezer must be dealt with somehow. It turns out that Ebenezer and David's father had had a dispute over a woman, David's mother. They had finally come to an agreement—David's father married his mother, and Ebenezer took the estate and the Balfour fortune, although he was not the elder brother. Rankeillor says the agreement is not legally binding, and that David is the true heir of the estate. But David does not want the House of Shaws, just a pension from its yearly earnings.
To rectify the situation, David plays a trick on Ebenezer. Rankeillor, David, and Alan go to the House of Shaws. Alan walks up to the door alone, and pretends that he is from a bunch of Highlanders who found David alive shortly after the shipwreck on the Torran Rocks. He asks for money to return to the boy, but Ebenezer refuses to pay anything. Alan then says that they'll kill him unless Ebenezer pays to have him kept alive. Ebenezer does not want the boy dead, and as he haggles over how much he will pay he admits that the plan had been for Hoseason to sell the boy into slavery in the Carolinas. At that point, David and Rankeillor reveal themselves, having caught Ebenezer in the confession. Ebenezer and Rankeillor then work out an agreement that David would get two-thirds of the yearly income of the House of Shaws.
David receives a note from Rankeillor that will allow him to collect his money. David then speaks to Alan, and arranges to send him money so that Alan can get passage to France. The two men part, and David wanders into town to claim his fortune."
Guided,"Scout Finch lives with her brother, Jem, and their widowed father, Atticus, in the sleepy Alabama town of Maycomb. Maycomb is suffering through the Great Depression, but Atticus is a prominent lawyer and the Finch family is reasonably well off in comparison to the rest of society. One summer, Jem and Scout befriend a boy named Dill, who has come to live in their neighborhood for the summer, and the trio acts out stories together. Eventually, Dill becomes fascinated with the spooky house on their street called the Radley Place. The house is owned by Mr. Nathan Radley, whose brother, Arthur (nicknamed Boo), has lived there for years without venturing outside.
Scout goes to school for the first time that fall and detests it. She and Jem find gifts apparently left for them in a knothole of a tree on the Radley property. Dill returns the following summer, and he, Scout, and Jem begin to act out the story of Boo Radley. Atticus puts a stop to their antics, urging the children to try to see life from another person’s perspective before making judgments. But, on Dill’s last night in Maycomb for the summer, the three sneak onto the Radley property, where Nathan Radley shoots at them. Jem loses his pants in the ensuing escape. When he returns for them, he finds them mended and hung over the fence.
The next winter, Jem and Scout find more presents in the tree, presumably left by the mysterious Boo. Nathan Radley eventually plugs the knothole with cement. Shortly thereafter, a fire breaks out in another neighbor’s house, and during the fire someone slips a blanket on Scout’s shoulders as she watches the blaze. Convinced that Boo did it, Jem tells Atticus about the mended pants and the presents.
To the consternation of Maycomb’s racist white community, Atticus agrees to defend a Black man named Tom Robinson, who has been accused of raping a white woman. Because of Atticus’s decision, Jem and Scout are subjected to abuse from other children, even when they celebrate Christmas at the family compound on Finch’s Landing. Calpurnia, the Finches’ Black cook, takes them to the local Black church, where the warm and close-knit community largely embraces the children.
Atticus’s sister, Alexandra, comes to live with the Finches the next summer. Dill, who is supposed to live with his “new father” in another town, runs away and comes to Maycomb. Tom Robinson’s trial begins, and when the accused man is placed in the local jail, a mob gathers to lynch him. Atticus faces the mob down the night before the trial. Jem and Scout, who have sneaked out of the house, soon join him. Scout recognizes one of the men, and her polite questioning about his son shames him into dispersing the mob.
At the trial itself, the children sit in the “colored balcony” with the town’s Black citizens. Atticus provides clear evidence that the accusers, Mayella Ewell and her father, Bob, are lying: in fact, Mayella propositioned Tom Robinson, was caught by her father, and then accused Tom of rape to cover her shame and guilt. Atticus provides impressive evidence that the marks on Mayella’s face are from wounds that her father inflicted; upon discovering her with Tom, he called her a whore and beat her. Yet, despite the significant evidence pointing to Tom’s innocence, the all-white jury convicts him. The innocent Tom later tries to escape from prison and is shot to death. In the aftermath of the trial, Jem’s faith in justice is badly shaken, and he lapses into despondency and doubt.
Despite the verdict, Bob Ewell feels that Atticus and the judge have made a fool out of him, and he vows revenge. He menaces Tom Robinson’s widow, tries to break into the judge’s house, and finally attacks Jem and Scout as they walk home from a Halloween party. Boo Radley intervenes, however, saving the children and stabbing Ewell fatally during the struggle. Boo carries the wounded Jem back to Atticus’s house, where the sheriff, in order to protect Boo, insists that Ewell tripped over a tree root and fell on his own knife. After sitting with Scout for a while, Boo disappears once more into the Radley house.  
Later, Scout feels as though she can finally imagine what life is like for Boo. He has become a human being to her at last. With this realization, Scout embraces her father’s advice to practice sympathy and understanding and demonstrates that her experiences with hatred and prejudice will not sully her faith in human goodness."
On,"Bri Jackson, the narrator of the novel, is a 16-year-old girl from Garden Heights, a predominantly Black inner-city neighborhood. Bri has her sights set on rap stardom, hoping to follow in the footsteps of her late father, the underground rap star Lawless. As the novel opens, Bri is nervously awaiting the phone call that could be her big break: an invitation to perform in the Ring, a local club where up-and-coming rappers face off in “battles.” But first, she must endure her ACT prep class at Midtown School of the Arts so she can get her confiscated phone back from her teacher. Bri’s two best friends from Garden Heights, Sonny and Malik, are in the class with her. Like many of the other students of color at Midtown Academy, they are bused in from less affluent neighborhoods. 
By the time Bri finally gets the call to battle at the Ring, both her teacher and her mother, Jay, have reminded her that school, not rap, is the key to her future. But Bri remains fixated on rap stardom as the solution to her family’s financial problems, especially after she learns that Jay, a recovering drug addict, has lost her job. Bri’s Aunt Pooh, a gang member and a drug dealer, escorts Bri to the battle at the Ring, where she squares off with Milez, another teen rapper. In the first round of the battle, Milez raps about Lawless’s murder, shocking Bri and causing her to freeze up when it is her turn to rap. But she soon recovers and outperforms Milez in the next two rounds, winning the battle decisively. By the following morning, a video of the battle is on YouTube and all Bri’s classmates are praising her for her skills.  
Bri’s celebration is short-lived, however. Tate and Long, two school security guards who have a reputation for targeting Black and Latinx students, single Bri out to have her bag searched. When Bri objects, they violently throw her to the ground and cuff her. Bri is suspended for having candy—which her principal refers to as ""contraband—in her backpack. The security guards are suspended too, pending an investigation, but rumors circulate around the school that Bri is a drug dealer.   
Angry about the assault and people’s racist assumptions about her, Bri writes and records a defiant song called “On the Come Up.” In the song, Bri rails against racist police and other authority figures. She also boasts about having a gun and being ready to use it—because that’s what people expect anyway—even though she barely knows anything about guns. Bri shares the recording with Supreme, her father’s old manager, who promises to make her famous. Supreme releases “On the Come Up” online, where it gets picked up by a Black gossip blog and goes viral. Many of Bri’s friends love the song, but Aunt Pooh, Malik, and Trey all chastise Bri for misrepresenting herself and rapping about gang violence that she has never taken part in.  
Real violence breaks out when Tate and Long are reinstated as the school security guards. Students of color protest outside the school while chanting some of the violent lyrics from “On the Come Up.” When Tate and Long warn them to stop, some students attack the security guards, and a riot ensues. A local news station reports that Bri’s song incited the violence. Jay sees the newscast, learns about Bri’s song for the first time, and insists that Bri stop rapping, lay low, and focus on school. Instead, Bri takes to Instagram and is interviewed by a local radio show, defiantly claiming on both platforms that she won’t be silenced. During the radio interview, Bri has to be restrained after DJ Hype insults her with sexist taunts. Bri begins to feel as though she’s becoming the violent person that others assume she is.  
Meanwhile, Bri’s family continues to struggle, falling behind on bills and rent. The electric company shuts off the power and the landlord threatens eviction. Jay quits school, setting aside her dreams so she can become eligible for food stamps. To make matters worse, the Crowns, a rival gang, rob Bri and Malik at gunpoint, taking her father’s gold chain. Aunt Pooh vows to get revenge on the Crowns and disappears for ten days. When she returns, Aunt Pooh is arrested in a drug bust and taken to jail while Bri looks on.  
With her family’s struggles in mind, Bri goes to a recording studio again, this time with Supreme. Supreme encourages Bri to embrace the persona of a “hoodlum” in her music because that is what people expect of Black rappers. He has another rapper write a song for Bri to record. Even though Bri does not agree with the lyrics, she reluctantly agrees to record the song, hoping to impress a white record executive.  
Bri returns to the Ring once more, where she is supposed to perform the song she recorded. Instead, Bri freestyles her own lyrics about refusing to be what people think she should be. The record executive angrily walks out, but the crowd goes wild. Later, an unnamed celebrity retweets the video of Bri’s freestyle and calls her the future of hip-hop. Bri decides that she will pursue a rap career, but only if she can do it on her own terms."
Sorrow,"Werther is a young, educated, middle-class gentleman setting out to earn a living and make his mark on the world. His family expects him to get a job, and his friend, Wilhelm, networks with his contacts to find opportunities in government service. Werther nurtures a desire to be an artist, a pastime that doesn't pay the bills but suits his keen powers of observation and imagination. Werther leaves home in the spring of 1771 and writes letters to Wilhelm over a twenty-month period as he travels.
As Werther intersects with the world, he paints a picture of the monotony of daily existence relieved by the lofty beauty of the natural world. In nature’s vistas, he finds relief from his own introspective, melancholy thoughts. At an estate his family manages, Werther befriends the local townspeople and feels especially drawn to children. The people there lead simple lives, however, and he misses the intellectual stimulation he enjoys from the educated classes. 
After Werther relocates to Walheim, he meets Charlotte, the beautiful daughter of a local district judge. Charlotte’s mother has recently died, leaving behind nine children. On her deathbed, the mother entrusted the children to Charlotte’s care and gave her blessing to Charlotte’s engagement to Albert, a successful businessman. Albert is traveling on business when Werther and Charlotte dance the night away at a ball. Werther finds a kindred spirit in Charlotte and falls madly in love with her. He visits daily and develops a close relationship with Charlotte’s siblings, who enjoy his roughhousing and storytelling. Charlotte doesn’t reconsider her commitment to marrying Albert, and Werther respects the boundaries of their friendship. However, due to Werther’s frustrated longing for a closer relationship and a recognition that he has no future with her, his infatuation with Charlotte slowly becomes an obsession. When Werther begins having suicidal thoughts, he realizes he must break from the vicious cycle.
In the fall, Werther relocates from the country to the court when he takes a position as an attaché to an ambassador. Werther invests himself in his work, but he finds himself at odds with court culture. The emphasis on class rank among the people who surround the count disgusts Werther, who judges the worth of people, whether peasant or noble, based on their accomplishments. Soon, Werther’s promising start in government service begins to unravel. His dismissive criticism of petty social climbing blows back on him. When Werther fails to observe strict class protocols at the count’s home, the resulting ostracism among his friends and associates causes him to resign his commission. A nobleman sponsors Werther with a stipend to stay awhile with him while he considers his future. He counsels Werther against joining the army, and Werther abandons that career path and passes his time improving his drawing skills.
Werther’s melancholic thoughts turn once again to Charlotte, whom he still loves despite the news he received in February of 1772 that Charlotte and Albert married. He returns to Walheim hoping to recapture some of the optimism and energy he felt there. Instead, life’s difficulties press in on him. A child whom he once drew and cared about has died. The beautiful old walnut trees in the square have been cut down. Werther often visits Charlotte, but their platonic relationship drives him increasingly into a suicidal depression. 
Werther’s behavior becomes increasingly unstable. When he mounts a manic defense of a confessed murderer, Albert wants no more to do with him. Albert’s request that Charlotte terminate all contact with Werther forces her to confront her complex feelings for Werther. On December 20, she tells Werther that he may only visit when invited, trying to set boundaries that would allow the friendship she values so much to continue while still showing solidarity with Albert. She invites Werther to join their family’s Christmas Eve celebration, and she assumes he will abide by her wishes. Charlotte tells Albert she has the situation under control, and he leaves on an overnight business trip the next morning.
Werther, however, has already planned to take his life, and he disregards Charlotte’s instructions, arriving unannounced the next evening during Albert’s absence. Charlotte hastily tries to summon friends to join them, but in the meantime, she suggests that he read to her from his translation of Ossian, an epic poem that describes a hero’s death. Charlotte understands that Werther intends to end his life. The tragic events depicted in the poetry create an emotionally charged picture of their doomed love affair, and they exchange a passionate kiss for the first time. Overcome with grief for Werther and horror at her betrayal of Albert, Charlotte locks herself in an adjoining room until Werther leaves.
Werther’s joy at realizing Charlotte does love him only confirms his plan to end his life rather than live without her. He embraces death as a sacrifice for their marriage. Werther calmly wraps up his affairs and writes letters to Wilhelm and Charlotte, and the next day he shoots himself with a pistol he borrowed from Albert. He survives the head wound for twelve hours before succumbing to the brain injury from the bullet entering his skull. Local field hands inter his body in a grave that Werther had specified, unattended by any mourners or clergy."
Already,"The novel begins where It Ends with Us left off, after the novel’s protagonists Lily Kincaid and Atlas Corrigan run into each other on the street, and Lily tells Atlas she and Ryle are now divorced. Told in chapters that alternate between Atlas’s and Lily’s perspectives, the novel begins with Atlas nervously hoping Lily will text him soon like she said she would. This hope keeps him uplifted as he handles the reality that someone broke into his restaurant, Bib’s, and vandalized it with a misspelled profanity. Meanwhile, Lily is incredibly busy at Lily Bloom’s, her flower shop, and is confused about what to do about Atlas, knowing a romance with Atlas will infuriate her jealous and abusive ex-husband, Ryle, with whom she shares jointed custody of their infant daughter Emerson.   
Atlas visits the flower shop wanting to talk to Lily and ask her if they can speak on the phone that evening. Ryle comes in unexpectedly, and a panicked Lily hides Atlas in the office supply closet. Lily and Atlas do talk on FaceTime that evening, catching up on each other’s lives, flirting, and testing the waters of their relationship. Hearing that Ryle responded in rage after reading Lily’s teenage journals about Atlas, Atlas asks Lily to read to him from the journals. 
On their first date, Lily gifts Atlas one of her journals. Exhausted after staying up all night with a sick Emerson, Lily falls asleep during the ride to the restaurant. Atlas lets Lily sleep, content to read her journal, reliving their first kiss. Inspired, Atlas writes Lily a letter about his life before her. Atlas recounts how his mother rejected and abused him as a teenager, choosing herself and her abusive husband Tim over Atlas. He says that Lily changed his life and taught him what love was. When Lily wakes up, she reads Atlas’s letter and is moved by it. They want to kiss goodnight but decide to continue taking it slow. 
After his date with Lily, Atlas encounters his mother, Sutton, who is at his restaurant to ask Atlas if he knows where his twelve-year-old brother Josh is. Atlas tells Sutton he didn’t know Josh existed until their conversation. Atlas realizes that Josh is likely the vandal targeting his restaurants. As Atlas deals with Sutton, Lily returns from their date to an angry Ryle, who has just watched Finding Nemo for the first time. Ryle is furious that his daughter’s middle name, Dory, is associated with Atlas, as he is aware that Lily and Atlas often talked about Dory as teenagers. Ryle’s rage-fueled confrontation shakes Lily, and after getting away from Atlas, she is comforted when Marshall, Ryle’s best friend and brother-in-law, tells her she was right to leave Ryle. After their respective rough nights, Atlas drives to Lily’s house to give her a hug. Afterward, Atlas stakes out Bib’s and reads Lily’s journal entry about the first time he and Lily made love, after which Lily’s father almost beat him to death. Atlas catches Josh attempting to vandalize his restaurant. He convinces Josh to come stay with him. Atlas doesn’t want Josh to return to live with Sutton, who he feels is still abusive and only cares about herself. The following day, Sutton demands that Atlas bring Josh to her, and when he does, Atlas sees Sutton strike Josh. He immediately gets Josh back in the car and then takes him to the hospital, vowing to fight for custody.  
Lily invites Atlas to be her date for her coworker Lucy’s wedding. While Lily is getting ready, Atlas sees Lily’s collarbone, the spot where Ryle once bit Lily, and notices the heart tattoo that Lily got as a teenager. Atlas feels upset upon realizing Ryle bit Lily’s collarbone out of jealousy. Lily realizes Atlas’s anger is protective, and she isn’t afraid of him. Atlas and Lily kiss. After making a brief appearance at Lucy’s wedding, they return to Lily’s and make love for the first time since they were teenagers. Afterward, they talk about Atlas fighting for custody of Josh and about the aftermath of Lily’s father’s violent outburst the last time they made love. Atlas returns home to Josh.  
The next morning, Lily is woken to the sound of Ryle pounding her door. Ryle notices evidence of the previous evening and quickly figures out that Lily was with Atlas. He flies into a rage, pinning her to the wall by her throat. Lily, afraid that he’s going to come for Emerson, tells her mother, who watched Emerson the previous night, to take her to a park. Unsure where to go after she picks Emerson up, Lily takes Emerson to Atlas’s and hides out. Josh is working on a homework assignment about his family tree that he struggles to finish because he doesn’t know his family. Atlas thinks if he and Lily were together, he’d raise Emerson as his own daughter. 
Lily wakes up the next morning to a series of angry, threatening texts from Ryle, who also comes to the flower shop to try to make nice after his drunken, menacing texts. Lily tells Ryle she’s sent the messages to her lawyer. Ryle leaves in a rage, and Lily warns Atlas that Ryle may be coming for him, and before Atlas hangs up, Ryle is there. Ryle punches Atlas, blaming him for his problems with Lily. Atlas nonconfrontationally points out to Ryle that his marriage ended because of his temper. Atlas tries to convince Ryle that they need to be a team, since Emerson is impacted by all of their behavior. Ryle leaves, somewhat less angry. Atlas tells Lily about the conversation, and she is pleased that he diffused the situation with words and not violence. 
Atlas and Lily are having a peaceful morning together when Sutton arrives at Atlas’s, demanding Josh back. Josh returns from Theo’s and is afraid of his mother. He insists he wants to live with his father, Tim. Sutton leaves and Lily connects with Josh while Atlas calms down. Atlas takes Josh to see his father in Vermont. Josh realizes he wants to stay with Atlas and says his family tree can be a seedling with two branches—one for him and one for Atlas. Later, Allysa, Marshall, and Lily confront Ryle, telling him that he needs to go to anger management and that he’ll only have supervised visits with Emerson and Rylee until further notice. Ryle is upset but agrees to get help. Meanwhile, Atlas tells Sutton that he wants custody of Josh but encourages her to meet them once a week for dinner, so she can still have a relationship with both her sons. Six months after they began dating, Atlas and Lily move in together. A few years later, they get married. In his vows, Atlas says that no matter what happens, he’s grateful to have gotten to love Lily and even to have her break his heart. He is hopeful for the future."
Inaugural,"Michelle Obama grows up in a two-story bungalow on Chicago’s South Side. Her parents, Fraser and Marian Robinson, rent an upstairs apartment from Marian’s aunt and uncle, who live downstairs. Michelle’s father has multiple sclerosis, but he does not let his disability limit him. He works at a water filtration plant and is also a local precinct captain for the Democratic party. Michelle is a smart, determined girl with little tolerance for disorder. She is less sociable than her older brother, Craig, a gifted basketball player who has many friends. Over time, however, Michelle learns to be more outgoing.
Michelle’s parents believe in education. Her mother does volunteer work on behalf of their neighborhood school, which struggles to maintain quality as the neighborhood declines. Fraser and Marian send Craig to a predominantly white Catholic school with a strong basketball program and a rigorous curriculum. When Michelle is ready for high school, she gains admission to Whitney Young, a new magnet school for gifted students. At Whitney Young, her friendship with a daughter of civil rights leader the Reverend Jesse Jackson gives Michelle a chance to observe what life is like for people active in politics.
Michelle follows her brother to Princeton, where she does well. One of her closest friends at Princeton is a Jamaican student named Suzanne; that friendship helps Michelle see that not everyone has to be as organized and driven as she is. Michelle graduates, studies law at Harvard, and goes to work at a high-end law firm in Chicago. By then, however, she realizes that she hates being a lawyer. Her life takes a turn when she is asked to help mentor a male summer associate named Barack Obama. The son of a Black Kenyan father and a white American mother, he is older than Michelle but started law school later, after some years doing other things, including community organizing in Chicago. Barack’s brilliance is quickly apparent to everyone at the firm, and he and Michelle are immediately attracted to each other.
As Michelle and Barack get acquainted, she sees that he has a higher tolerance for turmoil and uncertainty than she does. She also sees his dedication to making the world a better place. However, Michelle faces crushing loss: her friend Suzanne dies of cancer, and her father dies from MS after decades of fighting to live a normal life. Realizing that life is short, Michelle looks for opportunities to transition out of her legal career. Some personal connections lead to a job at city hall, working for Valerie Jarrett, who will become a lifelong friend and ally. Barack, meanwhile, works in the Chicago area for a national get-out-the vote organization. By now, he and Michelle are engaged. They marry in 1992.
Barack is working for a public interest law firm when the opportunity arises for him to run for a seat in the Illinois state senate. By now, Michelle has run a nonprofit organization and is serving as a university dean. Michelle does not like politics and predicts that Barack will not like it, either; but after he wins his race, he turns out to have the right kind of temperament and skills to be a politician. Then Barack loses his mother to cancer, and Michelle suffers a miscarriage. After failed attempts to conceive again, the Obamas turn to in vitro fertilization (IVF) and their first daughter, Malia, is born Michelle becomes director of community outreach at a hospital. 
After a failed campaign for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, daughter Sasha is born. Their burgeoning family and careers but strains on Michelle and Barack, but couples therapy helps them make some useful adjustments. Barack runs for the U.S. Senate and unexpectedly builds a commanding lead even before his speech at the Democratic National Convention boosts his national profile. He wins the Senate race easily.
When Barack moves to Washington, Michelle and the girls stay in Chicago. To her consternation, Barack and a team of advisers are already discussing a 2008 presidential run. She agrees to be part of the campaign but privately thinks that as a Black man, Barack cannot win. During the campaign, there are absurd rumors, circulated by his opponents, about Barack having Muslim ties. Michelle is an asset on the campaign trail, although she is discouraged when a video of one of her speeches is edited down to suggests that she carries a grudge against America. After the August convention, where Michelle gives a well-received speech, Barack and his running mate, Joe Biden, achieve a decisive win. Michelle believes that Barack is the right person to lead the country out of the ongoing economic recession.
The transition between the Bush and Obama administrations is smooth and welcoming. The White House staff is kind and efficient. Michelle and Barack learn to get used to being accompanied by Secret Service agents whenever they go out, but they do their best to keep the girls’ lives as normal as possible. Michelle’s mother, whom Barack and Michelle persuaded to move in with them, declines Secret Service protection altogether.
As First Lady, Michelle must be engaged and productive without overstepping her bounds. Her early work focuses on childhood obesity, through the Let’s Move! initiative to promote exercise and healthy eating. Michelle plants a vegetable garden on the South Lawn. She also promotes post-high school education through her Reach Higher initiative, and education for girls around the world through the Let Girls Learn initiative. Finally, she teams up with the Second Lady, Jill Biden, to improve support for military families through the Joining Forces initiative. 
During Barack’s successful reelection campaign in 2012, Michelle discovers the power of social media. Like the rest of the country, the Obamas are shocked by mass shootings at Sandy Hook School in Newtown, Connecticut and at a Black church in Charleston. The death of a Chicago girl in a drive-by shooting has personal meaning for Michelle: the girl lived not far from Michelle’s old neighborhood and had recently participated in the second inaugural celebration. 
During the 2016 presidential contest, Michelle is appalled by Donald Trump’s past and present behavior and is shocked when he achieves a come-from-behind win over Hillary Clinton. She takes comfort in all the things she and Barack have accomplished over the last eight years and reminds herself that there is much to be optimistic about."
Turned,"As far as teenager Isabel Conklin is concerned, summer is the only season that matters. For Isabel, nicknamed “Belly,” winter and spring are merely waiting periods. Not only is her birthday in August, but each June, she, her mother, Laurel, and her brother, Steven, travel to Cousins Beach to spend three months with the Fisher family, at their beach house on the Atlantic Coast.  
  Laurel Conklin and Susannah Fisher have been best friends since childhood, and now spend summers together with their children. Susannah has two teenage sons: Conrad, the eldest, is about to attend his freshman year of college, and Jeremiah is still in high school. The Fisher boys have been a source of friendship and fascination for Belly for as long as she can remember, and she’s been harboring a crush on Conrad for years. Both families have faced challenges; Susannah had cancer, and the Conklins recently divorced. 
The summer that Belly turns sixteen, major changes impact everyone staying at the Fisher’s beach house. After the Conklins arrive, the two families begin to settle in for what at first seems like a typical vacation—but it soon becomes clear that this summer won’t be the same as those before. Belly has blossomed into a beautiful young woman, and both boys notice the change in her appearance. However, Conrad’s moodiness makes Belly feel more distant from him than ever before. She learns that Conrad has quit the football team, broken up with his girlfriend, and started smoking. Initially, the cause of Conrad’s sullen mood is unclear. As the story progresses, the reader learns more about the difficulties facing the Fisher family. 
Fearing that Conrad will never reciprocate her feelings, Belly tries to ignore her crush on him. Soon after her brother Steven leaves to tour colleges with their father, Belly begins to pursue a relationship with a boy named Cam. They meet at a beach party and realize they had met once before when they were thirteen, at a convention for Latin students in Washington, D.C. Cam and Belly begin to date, and she likes that he is different from both Jeremiah and Conrad. Cam is “straight edge,” which means that he does not drink alcohol, do drugs, or practice other risky behavior. Although she appreciates this, Belly also becomes frustrated with the lack of physical intimacy between the two of them. She wishes that he would kiss her without asking first and take part in more risqué activities like skinny-dipping. 
Flashbacks throughout the novel show moments from different summers from the years that Belly was age ten through fourteen. Several chapters focus on the previous summer, when Belly’s best friend Taylor comes to Cousins Beach to visit for a week. In the past, Belly was something of a non-threatening sidekick for her pretty friend. However, during the visit, Taylor notices that Belly is becoming attractive in her own right and begins to see her as competition for male attention. On the other hand, Belly unfavorably compares her own appearance to that of her friend, who wears makeup and flattering clothing. Belly has her first kiss with Jeremiah during a game of truth or dare, and is mortified that Conrad and Steven watch it happen. By the end of Taylor’s visit, the two girls are still friends, but are not as close as they used to be. 
Although Belly and Cam date throughout the summer, romantic tension between Belly and Conrad grows. At a house party, Conrad becomes aggressive with a young man in his twenties. To prevent them from coming to blows, Belly steps between them to break up the argument. Later, as she sits alone with Conrad in a car, he gently strokes her hair. He is on the verge of saying something to her, but the moment passes. 
Toward the end of the novel, Belly’s attraction to Cam wanes, and after Jeremiah reveals his interest in her, she can no longer deny her crush on Conrad. Unwilling to let her affection remain unspoken, Belly confronts Conrad and tells him that she loves him. He rejects her, which leads to a physical altercation between the Fisher brothers. After Laurel breaks up the fight, Belly discovers the secret behind underlying tension in the house; Susannah’s cancer has returned, and she does not have long to live. Belly switches her attention from romance to supporting the Fisher family through their painful time. She comforts Jeremiah, promises Susannah that she’ll look after Conrad when she’s gone, and listens to Conrad express his devastation. Belly and Conrad share a kiss, but Conrad explains he is too distraught about his mother to start a relationship now. 
At the end of the summer, the Fishers and Conklins clean up the house and spend one last day at Cousins Beach. Several months later, Conrad drives from Boston to see Belly in the middle of winter. After her mother goes to sleep, Belly sneaks out of her house to meet him, suggesting the start of a relationship between the two teenagers."
Homage,"A Gathering of Old Men takes place on the Marshall Plantation in Bayonne Louisiana. The plantation's Cajun work boss, Beau Baton, has been murdered just before the novel begins. Candy Marshall, the partial owner and general overseer of the plantation, discovers Beau's dead body outside of Mathu's house. Candy believes that Mathu killed Beau, but as Mathu is virtually her foster father she wants to make every effort to protect him. Candy immediately gathers everyone in the plantation to Mathu's house. When Miss Merle, the mistress of a local plantation arrives, Candy promptly confesses to the murder. Miss Merle does not believe her, but agrees to help. Candy decides that the best course of action would be to bring all the local men to Mathu's house with as many twelve gauge shotguns and empty shells as possible. With numerous men and guns at the crime scene, Candy believes that the local Sheriff will not be able to solve the crime. Miss Merle spreads Candy's plan through the community. Within a few hours, eighteen men have gathered at Mathu's house. All of these men are in their seventies and their eighties, but they have all brought their shotguns and are ready to confess.
In addition to the arrival of the Sheriff, most people at the plantation await the arrival of local Cajun named Fix. Historically, Fix led many lynch mobs against the local blacks. Everyone at the plantation believes that he will soon arrive once again to seek revenge, especially since the murdered man, Beau, is his son. Before anything else happens though, two other men arrive: Lou Dimes, Candy's boyfriend, and Sheriff Mapes. After the Sheriff sees Beau's dead body, he instructs his deputy to find Fix and keep him off the plantation as to avoid a lynching. Candy promptly tells the Sheriff that she committed the murder, but he does not believe her. The Sheriff eyes the old men and decides to question them about the crime.
The first two men that the Sheriff Mapes questions, Billy Washington and Gable, both confess to the murder. When their answers displease him, the Sheriff strikes them each twice. Next, the Sheriff queries the Reverend Jameson to find out what is happening. When the Reverend tells him nothing, the Sheriff punches him so forcibly that the Reverend falls to the ground. The watching men respond by all physically lining up so that the Sheriff can easily hit them all. Their willingness to confess and their indifference to being struck startle the Sheriff. He stops his questioning and thinks about the murder. The Sheriff knows that Charlie, who is not present, works most closely with Beau, but believes that Charlie is too weak to have committed the act. The Sheriff decides that the only culprit could be Mathu because Mathu is the only black man who has ever demonstrated the strength to stand up to local whites. For the Sheriff, Mathu is the only man who is man enough to murder.
Although the Sheriff has a suspect, he cannot arrest anyone because everyone confesses. As the afternoon goes on, many other black men confess to Beau's murder. They explain that they killed Beau because of what they have suffered— a sister raped; a son executed for crime he did not commit; and a brother killed for beating a tractor in a race. Beau died, they explain, for their past sufferings. The Sheriff still believes that Mathu murdered Beau, but can do nothing so everyone just waits to see if Fix Bauton and a lynch mob will show up.
Beau Bauton's brother, Gil, is a star football player on the Louisiana State University team who plays closely with a black halfback named Cal. The two players rely upon one another for their success. Due to their racial combination the press has dubbed them ""Salt and Pepper."" When Gil learns of his brother's murder, he treats Cal coldly. He visits the Marshall Plantation where he sees the gathering of old black men with guns. This sight, and Candy's immediate confession, combined with his brother's death grieves him greatly. Eventually, Gil makes it to home to where his father, Fix Bauton, and others are waiting. Fix, old family friends, and some local racist whites want to revenge Beau's death. Gil begs his father to let justice take its course and argues that the days of lynching are over. Gil refuses to assist his family in violence, citing his desire become an All-American football player. Luke Will, a local ruffian, criticizes Gil's perspective, and so too does Gil's father. Still, Fix will not revenge Beau's death without all of his sons. Without Gil, Fix decides to stay home. Luke Will, on the other hand, is up for the job and gathers some men to help him. They stop first at a local bar to drink some whisky in order to be prepared for the lynching.
Back at the plantation, Sheriff Mapes has found out that Fix is not coming. Mathu peacefully agrees to go to jail. Before they leave however, Charlie returns. Charlie confesses that he killed Beau after Beau threatened him. Charlie then asked Mathu to take the blame and fled. Charlie has spent the day hiding in the swamps, but felt called back to confess and show that he is truly a man.
Before Sheriff Mapes can take Charlie in, Luke Will and his crew arrive. They demand that Mapes hand Charlie over. When Mapes refuses, Luke Will shoots Mapes in the arm. The old black men grab live shotgun shells that they have been hiding in their pockets and start shooting at the whites. Sheriff Mapes remains fallen and injured in Mathu's front yard. The shooting surprises the whites and one of them, Leroy, is lightly injured. As the battle continues, Charlie and Luke Will become the primary fighters, dead set on eliminating the other. Eventually, Charlie rises from his hiding spot and manages to shoot Luke Will before he himself is shot to death. Everyone in the community pays homage to Charlie's dead body.
A trial for all blacks and whites involved in the shooting takes place a week after the event. The judge places everyone on probation for five years. At the trial's end, Mathu disappears with the other black men in a car, while Candy lingers on the courthouse steps with Lou. She grips his hand tightly as the novel closes in a gesture that reaffirms her commitment to their relationship."
Powers,"At the beginning of the novel, the priest is waiting for a boat that will take him out of the capital city. He is on the run from the police because religion has been outlawed in his state and he is the last remaining clergyman. While talking to a man named Mr. Tench, he is summoned to a dying woman's house and misses his boat. He hides out in a barn on the estate of a plantation owner, befriending the owner's daughter. Forced to move on, he heads to a village in which he used to live and work as pastor. There he meets Maria, a woman with whom he has had a brief affair, and Brigida, his illegitimate daughter. He spends the night in the town and wakes before dawn to say mass for the villagers. The lieutenant—a sworn enemy of all r eligion—arrives at the end of mass, leading a group of policemen in search of the priest, and the priest goes out to the town square to face his enemy. No one in the village turns him in, however, and the lieutenant does not realize that he has foun d the man he is looking for. Instead, the lieutenant takes a hostage, whom he says he will execute if he finds that the villagers have been lying to him about the whereabouts of the wanted man.
The priest heads to the town of Carmen, and on the way he meets a man known simply as the mestizo. Uninvited, the mestizo accompanies the priest on his journey, and it very soon becomes clear that he is an untrustworthy figure, and most likely interes ted in following the priest so that he can turn him in and collect the reward money. The priest finally admits that he is, indeed, a priest. But the mestizo, who has become feverish by the second day of their journey together, does not have the strength t o follow the priest when he veers off course. The priest knows that if he enters Carmen he will surely be captured, and he lets the mestizo ride on towards the town by himself.
The priest then backtracks to the capital city. He is in disguise, wearing a drill suit, and he tries to procure a bottle of wine so he can say mass. He meets a beggar who takes him to a hotel and introduces him to a man who says he can supply him with th e wine. The man arrives and sells the priest a bottle of wine and a bottle of brandy. But, taking advantage of the priest's offer to share a drink with him, the man proceeds to drink the entire bottle of wine, thwarting the priest's plan. The priest then leaves the hotel but is caught with the bottle of brandy by a state official. After a lengthy chase through the streets of the town, during which the priest unsuccessfully attempts to take refuge at the house of Padre Jose, he is caught and taken to j ail. In jail he speaks with the prisoners, admitting to them that he is a priest. A pious woman, in jail for having religious articles in her home, argues with the priest. The next day, the priest is ordered to clean out the cells and, while doing so, meets the mestizo again. But the mestizo decides not to turn the priest in to the authorities. The priest has another face-to-face encounter with the lieutenant, but again goes unrecognized, and is allowed to go free.
The priest spends a night at the abandoned estate of the Fellows and then moves on to an abandoned village. He meets an Indian woman whose son has been shot and killed by the gringo, an American outlaw who is also on the run from police. He accompanie s the woman to a burial ground and then leaves her there. Fatigued, and almost completely drained of the will to live, the priest staggers on, eventually coming upon a man named Mr. Lehr who informs him that he is out of danger, having crossed the bor der into a neighboring state where religion is not outlawed.
After spending a few days at the home of Mr. Lehr, the priest prepares to leave for Las Casas. But before he can depart, the mestizo arrives, informing him that the gringo has been mortally wounded by the police and is asking for someone to come and hear his confession. The priest, aware that he is walking into a trap, finally agrees to accompany the mestizo back across the border. There he meets the gringo, who refuses to repent for his sins and then dies. Then, as expected, the lieutenant arrives and ta kes the priest into custody. The two men have a long conversation about their beliefs and then, when the storm front clears, the lieutenant takes the priest back to the capital city for his trial.
On the night before the priest is to be executed, the lieutenant goes to the home of Padre Jose to see if he will come and hear the confession of the captured priest. Padre Jose refuses and the lieutenant returns to the police station with a bottle of bra ndy for the priest. That night, the priest tries to repent for his sins, but finds he cannot. He wakes up the next morning afraid of the impending execution.
The next day, Mr. Tench watches the execution from the window of the jefe's office. Later that night the boy hears about what happened to the priest and realizes that the man is a martyr and a hero. He dreams about him that night, and wakes up to the sound of knocking at the door. Opening the door, he finds a man seeking shelter, and when the boy learns that the man is a priest, he swings the door wide open to let him in."
Drought,"Returning home to the Laguna Pueblo reservation from World War II, via a Veteran's Hospital, Tayo must find a way to cure himself of his mental anguish, and to bring the rain back to his community. Combining prose and poetry, Ceremony interweaves the individual story of Tayo and the collective story of his people. As Tayo's journey unfolds, it is paralleled by poems telling old stories.
The trauma of thinking he saw his uncle Josiah's face among a crowd of Japanese soldiers he was ordered to shoot, and then of watching his cousin Rocky die, drove Tayo out of his mind. A period of time in a Veterans' Hospital gets him well enough to return to his home, with his Grandmother, his Auntie, and her husband Robert. This is the family unit that raised him after his mother, who had conceived him with an unknown white man, left him for good at the age of four. In his family's home Tayo faces not only their disappointment at the loss of Rocky, but also his continued grieving over his favorite uncle Josiah's death. He also contends with his guilt over a prayer against the rain he uttered in the forests of the Philippines, which he thinks is responsible for the six-year drought on the reservation.
As he slowly recuperates, Tayo realizes that he is not alone. His childhood friends Harley, Leroy, Emo, and Pinkie who also fought in the war contend with similar post-traumatic stress, self-medicating with alcohol. The company is little comfort. His old friends spend their drunken hours reminiscing about how great the war was and how much respect they got while they were in uniform. These stories only make Tayo think about the tremendous discrimination the Native Americans face at the hands of the whites, whom they nonetheless seem to admire, and he is even more saddened and infuriated. Just as Tayo begins to give up hope and to wish he could return to the VA hospital, his grandmother calls in the medicine man, Ku'oosh. Ku'oosh performs for Tayo a ceremony for warriors who have killed in battle, but both Ku'oosh and Tayo fear that the ancient ceremonies are not applicable to this new situation.
Tayo is helped but not cured by Ku'oosh's ceremony. It prompts him to consider his childhood, especially the summer before he left for the army. Although Auntie did her best to keep the two boys separate, Tayo and Rocky became close friends, and the summer after they graduated from high school, they enlisted in the army together. That summer, Josiah fell in love with Night Swan, a Mexican woman who lived just outside the reservation. At her urging, he invested in a herd of Mexican cattle, which Tayo helped him to care for. As so often happens, there is a drought that summer. Having heard the old stories of how droughts are ended, Tayo goes to a spring and invents a rain ceremony. The following day it rains. In addition to helping the crops and the cattle, the rain keeps Josiah from visiting Night Swan. He asks Tayo to bring her a note. Tayo delivers the note, and in the process is seduced by Night Swan.
Realizing that his ceremony has not been enough for Tayo, Ku'oosh sends him to the nearby town of Gallup to see another medicine man, Betonie, who knows more about the problems incurred by the contact between Native American and white cultures. Although he is skeptical of Betonie's strange ways and especially high connection with the white world, Tayo tells him of his what is troubling him. Betonie listens and explains that they must invent and complete a new ceremony. Tayo accepts. Betonie tells Tayo stores of the old ceremonies as he performs them. Then Betonie tells Tayo stories of his grandfather, Descheeny, and the beginning of the creation of a new ceremony to stop the destruction the whites, an invention of Native American witchery, are wreaking on the world.
Betonie sends Tayo back home, reminding him that the ceremony is still far from complete. When he meets Harley and Leroy on the way home, Tayo slips back into their lifestyle for a moment, but soon moves on, heeding the signs Betonie told him of as he searches for Josiah's cattle. Tayo follows the stars to a woman's house. After spending a night with the woman, Ts'eh, Tayo heads up into the mountains. He finds Josiah's cattle fenced into a white man's pasture. While Tayo breaks into the pasture, the cattle run off to its far reaches, and Tayo spends all night looking for them. As dawn approaches, Tayo is about to give up when a mountain lion comes up to him. Tayo honors the mountain lion, and follows its tracks to the cattle. Just as he herds the cattle out of the pasture, two white patrolmen find Tayo. Not realizing that the cattle are missing, but knowing Tayo has trespassed, the patrolmen arrest Tayo. Before they can bring him to town, however, they notice the mountain lion tracks and let Tayo go in order to hunt it. As Tayo heads out, it begins to snow. Tayo knows this will cover the tracks of his cattle and of the mountain lion, making the patrolmens' efforts fruitless. On the way down the mountain, Tayo meets a hunter, who lives with Ts'eh. When they arrive back at her house, she has corralled Tayo's cattle, which she keeps until Tayo and Robert return with a cattle truck to gather them up.
Returning home with Josiah's cattle, Tayo feels cured. However, the drought persists, and Tayo knows the ceremony is not complete. He goes to the family's ranch with the cattle, where he finds Ts'eh . They spend the summer together, but as it draws to an end Robert visits and warns Tayo that Emo has been spreading rumors about him. Shortly thereafter, Ts'eh tells Tayo that Emo and the white police are coming after him. Before she leaves, she tells Tayo how to avoid capture.
Following Ts'eh's instructions, Tayo easily evades the white police. Still running from Emo, he meets Harley and Leroy. Almost too late, Tayo realizes that Harley and Leroy have joined forces with Emo. Running again, Tayo finds himself in an abandoned uranium mine. As he looks at the gaping hole left in the earth, Tayo realizes that this is the last station of his ceremony, the one where he incorporates an element of white culture, the mine. All he has to do is to spend the night there and the ceremony will be complete. Soon Emo and Pinkie arrive. From a hiding place, Tayo must watch them torture Harley to death, and restrain himself from killing Emo in order to save Harley. With the help of the wind, Tayo survives the night. He returns home and goes back to Ku'oosh. After hearing all about Tayo's ceremony, Ku'oosh pronounces that Ts'eh was in fact A'moo'ooh, who has given her blessings to Tayo and his ceremony; the drought is ended and the destruction of the whites is stopped. Tayo spends one last night in Ku'oosh's house to finish off the ceremony, and then he returns home."
Security,"The Giver is written from the point of view of Jonas, an eleven-year-old boy living in a futuristic society that has eliminated all pain, fear, war, and hatred. There is no prejudice, since everyone looks and acts basically the same, and there is very little competition. Everyone is unfailingly polite. The society has also eliminated choice: at age twelve every member of the community is assigned a job based on his or her abilities and interests. Citizens can apply for and be assigned compatible spouses, and each couple is assigned exactly two children each. The children are born to Birthmothers, who never see them, and spend their first year in a Nurturing Center with other babies, or “newchildren,” born that year. When their children are grown, family units dissolve and adults live together with Childless Adults until they are too old to function in the society. Then they spend their last years being cared for in the House of the Old until they are finally “released” from the society. In the community, release is death, but it is never described that way; most people think that after release, flawed newchildren and joyful elderly people are welcomed into the vast expanse of Elsewhere that surrounds the communities. Citizens who break rules or fail to adapt properly to the society’s codes of behavior are also released, though in their cases it is an occasion of great shame. Everything is planned and organized so that life is as convenient and pleasant as possible.
Jonas lives with his father, a Nurturer of new children, his mother, who works at the Department of Justice, and his seven-year-old sister Lily. At the beginning of the novel, he is apprehensive about the upcoming Ceremony of Twelve, when he will be given his official Assignment as a new adult member of the community. He does not have a distinct career preference, although he enjoys volunteering at a variety of different jobs. Though he is a well-behaved citizen and a good student, Jonas is different: he has pale eyes, while most people in his community have dark eyes, and he has unusual powers of perception. Sometimes objects “change” when he looks at them. He does not know it yet, but he alone in his community can perceive flashes of color; for everyone else, the world is as devoid of color as it is of pain, hunger, and inconvenience.
At the Ceremony of Twelve, Jonas is given the highly honored Assignment of Receiver of Memory. The Receiver is the sole keeper of the community’s collective memory. When the community went over to Sameness—its painless, warless, and mostly emotionless state of tranquility and harmony—it abandoned all memories of pain, war, and emotion, but the memories cannot disappear totally. Someone must keep them so that the community can avoid making the mistakes of the past, even though no one but the Receiver can bear the pain. Jonas receives the memories of the past, good and bad, from the current Receiver, a wise old man who tells Jonas to call him the Giver.
The Giver transmits memories by placing his hands on Jonas’s bare back. The first memory he receives is of an exhilarating sled ride. As Jonas receives memories from the Giver—memories of pleasure and pain, of bright colors and extreme cold and warm sun, of excitement and terror and hunger and love—he realizes how bland and empty life in his community really is. The memories make Jonas’s life richer and more meaningful, and he wishes that he could give that richness and meaning to the people he loves. But in exchange for their peaceful existence, the people of Jonas’s community have lost the capacity to love him back or to feel deep passion about anything. Since they have never experienced real suffering, they also cannot appreciate the real joy of life, and the life of individual people seems less precious to them. In addition, no one in Jonas’s community has ever made a choice of his or her own. Jonas grows more and more frustrated with the members of his community, and the Giver, who has felt the same way for many years, encourages him. The two grow very close, like a grandfather and a grandchild might have in the days before Sameness, when family members stayed in contact long after their children were grown.
Meanwhile, Jonas is helping his family take care of a problem newchild, Gabriel, who has trouble sleeping through the night at the Nurturing Center. Jonas helps the child to sleep by transmitting soothing memories to him every night, and he begins to develop a relationship with Gabriel that mirrors the family relationships he has experienced through the memories. When Gabriel is in danger of being released, the Giver reveals to Jonas that release is the same as death. Jonas’s rage and horror at this revelation inspire the Giver to help Jonas devise a plan to change things in the community forever. The Giver tells Jonas about the girl who had been designated the new Receiver ten years before. She had been the Giver’s own daughter, but the sadness of some of the memories had been too much for her and she had asked to be released. When she died, all of the memories she had accumulated were released into the community, and the community members could not handle the sudden influx of emotion and sensation. The Giver and Jonas plan for Jonas to escape the community and to actually enter Elsewhere. Once he has done that, his larger supply of memories will disperse, and the Giver will help the community to come to terms with the new feelings and thoughts, changing the society forever.
However, Jonas is forced to leave earlier than planned when his father tells him that Gabriel will be released the next day. Desperate to save Gabriel, Jonas steals his father’s bicycle and a supply of food and sets off for Elsewhere. Gradually, he enters a landscape full of color, animals, and changing weather, but also hunger, danger, and exhaustion. Avoiding search planes, Jonas and Gabriel travel for a long time until heavy snow makes bike travel impossible. Half-frozen, but comforting Gabriel with memories of sunshine and friendship, Jonas mounts a high hill. There he finds a sled—the sled from his first transmitted memory—waiting for him at the top. Jonas and Gabriel experience a glorious downhill ride on the sled. Ahead of them, they see—or think they see—the twinkling lights of a friendly village at Christmas, and they hear music. Jonas is sure that someone is waiting for them there."
Died,"Around midnight one September night in New York City, eighteen-year-old Mateo Torrez gets a phone call from the mysterious organization Death-Cast. Death-Cast’s employees notify people known as Deckers that they will die within twenty-four hours, but no one knows exactly when or how their deaths will occur. Mateo is alone when he gets the news. Mateo is often home alone because he struggles with anxiety. His mother died in childbirth, and his father has been in a coma for two weeks. Not long after, seventeen-year-old Rufus Emeterio also gets a phone call from Death-Cast notifying him of his impending death. Rufus is in the middle of beating up his ex-girlfriend’s new boyfriend, Peck, while his foster brothers, Malcom and Tagoe, look on. Rufus, Malcolm, and Tagoe are best friends who call themselves the Plutos. Rufus’s parents and older sister died four months earlier when their car crashed into the Hudson River. 
After struggling to leave his apartment for a couple of hours, Mateo signs up on the Last Friend app. Last Friend connects Deckers with someone to spend their last day alive, called an End Day. Meanwhile, Rufus coordinates his own funeral with The Plutos, his foster parents, and his ex-girlfriend, Aimee. Aimee used to be a part of the Plutos until she was adopted by her aunt. Aimee brings Peck to the funeral. While Aimee and Rufus argue, Peck gets a friend to call the police on Rufus for beating him up. When the police show up, the Plutos help Rufus escape, but Tagoe and Malcolm are arrested. Now alone on his End Day, Rufus signs up on the Last Friend app where he connects with Mateo. After chatting for a little while, Rufus goes to Mateo’s apartment. They decide to spend their End Day together. First, they visit the hospital so Mateo can say goodbye to his father. Then, they spend time at Rufus’s favorite diner before Mateo visits his best friend, a single mother named Lidia. Mateo spends some time alone with Lidia and her daughter, Penny, but does not tell her it’s his End Day. After, Rufus shows Mateo his Instagram account. All his photos since his parents and sister died are in black and white. Mateo convinces Rufus to document his End Day using color photos instead. 
Rufus takes a phone call from Aimee and finds out that Malcolm and Tagoe were arrested for helping him beat up Peck. Mateo overhears part of the conversation and takes off, scared that Rufus is dangerous. Rufus catches up to Mateo and explains why the police are after him. He opens up about his complicated relationship with Aimee and the tragic day he witnessed the deaths of his parents and sister. Mateo realizes Rufus is not dangerous and promises not to leave again. The boys decide to visit Make-a-Moment, a virtual reality company meant to provide Deckers with bucket list experiences before they die. Rufus and Mateo choose to try skydiving but find it disappointing. While wandering the city after, they discover some old payphones in a ditch and Rufus takes pictures to post to his Instagram account. After, they take the subway to the cemetery where Mateo’s mother is buried. The boys stumble upon cemetery workers already digging Mateo’s grave. Despite the upsetting scene, Mateo finds a sense of closure and resolves to live his life to the fullest on his End Day. Mateo convinces Rufus to visit a pier over the Hudson River to mourn his family so that Rufus may find the same sense of peace with his own grief. Afterward, they narrowly survive a bombing at a bookstore, and the experience makes Rufus realize how scared he is of dying.  
Mateo realizes it’s important to spend your End Day with loved ones. He calls Lidia, and he and Rufus meet her at the World Travel Arena, an interactive experience where Deckers can visit places they’ll never get to see in real life. Rufus holds Mateo’s hand, and Mateo realizes that he has feelings for Rufus. After, Rufus, Mateo, and Lidia decide to go to a Decker club. At the club, Mateo lets loose and sings in public for the first time, then kisses Rufus. The Plutos show up, and they’re all having a great time until Peck and his gang arrive. Peck has been stalking Rufus’s Instagram account to discover his location. He wants to kill Rufus as payback for the beating Rufus gave him. Peck threatens Rufus with a gun, but Mateo punches Peck, saving Rufus. All the boys begin to fight, and Rufus wrestles the gun away, shooting all the bullets into a wall. Everyone scatters, Peck and his gang are arrested, and Mateo and Rufus decide to go to Mateo’s apartment. 
At Mateo’s home, Rufus and Mateo talk about all the things they would have liked to have done together if they had more time. Mateo sings for Rufus and tells him he loves him. Rufus says he loves Mateo too, and they decide not to leave Mateo’s room and curl up together in the bed to nap. When Mateo wakes up, he decides to make them both tea, but when he turns on the stove, it explodes and kills him. Rufus wakes up to the smoke and searches for Mateo. Rufus drags Mateo’s body out of the apartment, but it is too late. Rufus is taken to the hospital, but he leaves after visiting Mateo’s father and leaving him a note. On his way to the park where he and Mateo spent time earlier, Rufus plays a video of Mateo singing. Distracted, he steps into the street. He doesn’t see the car speeding toward him."
Forebears,"N. Scott Momaday, a poet and novelist of Kiowa descent, learns that his grandmother, Aho, has died. She is buried near Rainy Mountain, Oklahoma, and Momaday wants to visit her grave. He decides to make the journey the long way—by following the ancient migration route of the Kiowas, from their original homeland near the headwaters of the Yellowstone River east to the Black Hills and then south to Oklahoma. During this migration, the Kiowas had acquired horses and the Sun Dance religion. Their warrior society once dominated the southern Great Plains. 
As Momaday follows his ancestors’ journey, he recounts oral histories passed on to him by his parents and grandparents. He collects pieces of historical information, records his own impressions and memories, and composes poems. He arranges these diverse materials to form a narrative wheel, in which the voice of Kiowa oral tradition, the voice of historical commentary, and the personal voice of the author take turns telling stories of multiple journeys that form a single journey of the human spirit. Paintings by Al Momaday, the author’s father, illustrate key scenes from the Kiowas’ oral history.
The voice of oral tradition begins with the myth of how Kiowas enter the world through a hollow log. Although they must leave many of their people behind, they are happy with what they see. Sometime later, two of their chiefs argue over the udders of an antelope. One chief gets so angry that he takes his followers and leaves, never to be seen again. A talking dog agrees to help a man escape his enemies, and in return the man cares for her puppies.
A Kiowa woman hangs a little girl’s cradle in a tree. A redbird lures the child out of her cradle. As the girl climbs after the bird, the tree grows and carries her to the sky. There the sun is waiting to make her his wife. The girl weds the sun and has a child. Later, after arguing with her husband, the woman lowers a rope and climbs down, trying to reach her people. The angry sun throws a ring and kills his wife, leaving the child alone. A grandmother spider ensnares the sun’s child, a little boy, and raises him as her own son. The sun’s child keeps the ring that killed his mother. He tosses the ring toward the sky. The ring falls on him and splits him in two. Now grandmother spider must raise twins. She teaches them a sacred word that helps them escape evil giants. Then the twins kill a snake without realizing he is their grandfather. Heartbroken, the grandmother spider dies, but the twins live on for a long time.
The Kiowas suffer hard times, when food is scarce. A man is out looking for food when Tai-me (the sacred Sun Dance doll) appears, covered with feathers. She promises to give the Kiowas whatever they want. From this time on she will belong to the Kiowas. Another legend tells of two brothers who receive a mysterious gift of meat during a hungry winter. While one brother feels afraid of the meat, the other brother eats it and is transformed into a water beast.
Kiowa storytellers recite newer legends about their forebears and their life on the plains. They tell of a woman who saves her family by throwing hot grease at her enemies and of a skilled arrow maker who shoots his enemy right in the heart. They speak of how horses came to be and of terrible winds and storms. The elders relive the love story of the great warrior Quoetotai and one of the wives of Many Bears. They celebrate a buffalo with horns of steel—and the hunter who kills him with one last perfect shot. One tale relates what happens to a wife who abandons her husband. Another tale tells of some young men who ride south to find the homeland of the sun and of the spooky events that made them return to their homes and their life of hunting buffalo.
The Kiowas also tell of two brothers who are captured by the Utes. The Ute chief offers freedom if one brother can carry the other over a path of greased buffalo heads. The Kiowa hero accomplishes the task. The elders also tell how a great horse dies of shame after its hunter shows fear.
The Kiowas recite stories about Mammedaty, the grandson of Guipahgo. Mammedaty has visions, such as his vision of a child in the grass. He also has a bad temper—he shoots a horse in anger. Aho, Momaday’s grandmother, joins the voices of the elders. She tells of the time the Tai-me bundle fell to the floor with a great noise. Momaday, the author, adds the tale of a beautifully dressed woman buried somewhere near the house of Mammedaty, his grandfather.
Momaday adds historical comments after each story in the Kiowas’ oral history. He explains that the name Kiowa contains the meaning of two different halves. Momaday describes Kiowa traditional dress, their hunting practices, their “dog societies” of skilled warriors, their skill with horses, their Sun Dance ceremony, which was centered on the sacred doll Tai-me, and their later peyote rituals. He also records key events in the decline and destruction of the Kiowas and their culture.
Momaday also adds comments in his own voice after each Kiowa story and historical comment. He describes the land and its living things—wildflowers, insects, and spiders—in intimate detail and records how places make him feel. Momaday adds memories of his grandmother, Aho; of his grandfather, Mammedaty; and of Mammedaty’s grandmother and other elders. He shares a final oral memory from Ko-sahn, a one-hundred-year-old woman. Ko-sahn remembers how, in her childhood, she helped get the lodge ready for the Sun Dance, how an old woman sprinkled special earth on the lodge floor, and how beautiful it was to watch the Sun Dance, which was all for Tai-me."
Surveying,"Laura Thatcher Ulrich begins each chapter of A Midwife’s Tale by transcribing a few entries from Martha Ballard’s diary, from the month and year listed in the chapter title. Ulrich follows these entries with an essay that further explains the entries’ details and relates the entries to what happened to Martha in the surrounding few years. Ulrich explains and builds on the entries with her own analysis, and she provides a wider historical context by drawing from documents such as town records and the diaries of Martha’s New England contemporaries.
Martha Moore was born in 1735 in the small town of Oxford, Massachusetts, to a well-educated family. She married Ephraim Ballard in 1754 and had her first child, Cyrus, two years later. She quickly had five more children—four daughters and one more son—but lost three of the girls to a diphtheria epidemic in 1769. That same year, she gave birth to her fifth daughter, and her sixth followed two years later. In 1773, Ephraim traveled to Maine to find a new home for the family, finally settling in Hallowell and taking management of the mill and property owned by a British sympathizer who had fled to Canada. Martha and the children joined Ephraim there in October of 1777, and Martha officially delivered her first child as a midwife in July of 1778. Martha’s oldest daughter, Lucy, married her cousin Ephraim Towne that same year, and in 1799, Martha gave birth to her youngest son. She begins writing in her diary on January 1, 1785.
In August of 1787, Martha describes several events that give an overview of the many medically related tasks she is called on to perform, including delivering babies, answering false alarms, preparing bodies for burial, making medical calls, dispensing pills, and harvesting and preparing healing herbs. Ulrich then gives an overview of homeopathic remedies of the time and the relationship between local healers and physicians. In September of 1788, Martha talks about the goods she and her daughters trade with local women and the help her daughters give her with the housework, particularly the weaving. Ulrich then discusses the gender-based division of duties, the female economic subsystem of the time period, and the importance of household help in a midwife’s career. In October of the following year, Martha’s family is forced to relocate when the mill’s original owner returns, and she discusses the difficulties of living so much closer to her neighbors. She also talks about being questioned when one of these new neighbors accuses a public official of rape. Ulrich offers a fuller historical account of the case and its participants.
In November of 1792, Martha’s niece, Parthenia Barton, who had been living with the family for some time, marries Shubael Pitts. Martha’s daughter Hannah marries Moses Pollard, the son of an old friend, Merriam Pollard, who often worked as a town nurse. Ulrich then describes traditional marriage practices in those days, including simple, work-intensive weddings and the fact that couples lived apart until they were able to set up a household. Martha also talks about being summoned to Sally Pierce’s delivery. Sally identified Martha’s son Jonathan as the father of her illegitimate baby and sued him for support, which he fulfilled by marrying her. Ulrich then discusses the histories and results of other paternity suits from that time period. In November and December of 1793, Martha describes several complication-free deliveries she performs in the quiet period following the weddings. Ulrich expands upon this by explaining in more detail how these deliveries might have gone and comparing Martha’s success rate to other historical rates.
Martha’s youngest daughter, Dolly, marries Barnabas Lambard in May of 1795, and in Martha’s entries for January of the following year, the problem of housework has become dramatically larger now that she has no one at home to help her with it. In November of that year, Martha recounts that a band of armed men had attacked her husband while he attempted to complete a survey job. Ulrich adds further explanation, saying that poor settlers often saw surveyors as agents of richer men who were trying to take away the land that the settlers felt they had won for themselves. Even in these more difficult times, Martha’s medical involvement in the community still continues, and in February of 1801, Martha talks about tending to the death of her daughter-in-law’s nephew and being asked by the doctor to be an attendant at his dissection. Ulrich follows this with a more detailed look at the little boy’s history and offers a look at the changing relationship between doctors and midwives.
By March of 1804, Martha had grown weary, troubled by untrustworthy hired help, Jonathan’s often alcohol-induced temper, and Ephraim’s imprisonment for debt related to his job as a tax collector. Ulrich gives a more detailed picture of what Ephraim’s imprisonment would have been like, after which Martha describes the difficulties of being a woman on her own. Jonathan and his family move in with her, but due to her strained relationship with Jonathan, and Sally’s insistence on being mistress of the house, the move only adds to Martha’s troubles. In 1806, however, Martha’s neighborhood faces even greater obstacles when they discover that a neighbor, Captain Purrinton, had slaughtered almost his entire family before committing suicide. Ulrich describes the entirety of the case and gives a few theories offered at the time as to Captain Purrinton’s motives. Eight months later, another tragedy hits Martha’s family when the husband of her niece, Betsy Barton, commits suicide.
By May of 1809, Martha’s focus is mainly on her garden, the preparation that went into it, and what happened to the produce that came from it. Grandchildren are now old enough to help her with the housework, and the number of deliveries she attends has increased dramatically. Ulrich offers details on gardens of the time period but also describes the larger political turmoil of the area that is only offered in brief, family-related details in Martha’s diary. Martha attends several deliveries early in 1812, but the stress makes her ill, and her last entry describes the family and preacher gathering at her house on May 7. She dies a few weeks later.
Martha’s diary is passed down through Dolly’s descendents until it reaches Martha’s great-great-granddaughter, Mary Hobart, one of the country’s early female physicians. Mary treasures the diary but gives it to the Maine State Library in 1930 so that it might be more accessible to historians."
Forced,"NOTE: Although Night is not necessarily a memoir, this SparkNotes guide often refers to it as one, since the work’s mixture of testimony, deposition, and emotional truth-telling renders it similar to works in the memoir genre. It is clear that Eliezer is meant to serve, to a great extent, as author Elie Wiesel’s stand-in and representative. Minor details have been altered, but what happens to Eliezer is what happened to Wiesel himself during the Holocaust. It is important to remember, however, that there is a difference between the persona of narrator of Night, Eliezer, and that of its author, Elie Wiesel.
Night is narrated by Eliezer, a Jewish teenager who, when the memoir begins, lives in his hometown of Sighet, in Hungarian Transylvania. Eliezer studies the Torah (the first five books of the Old Testament) and the Kabbalah (a doctrine of Jewish mysticism). His instruction is cut short, however, when his teacher, Moishe the Beadle, is deported. In a few months, Moishe returns, telling a horrifying tale: the Gestapo (the German secret police force) took charge of his train, led everyone into the woods, and systematically butchered them. Nobody believes Moishe, who is taken for a lunatic.
In the spring of 1944, the Nazis occupy Hungary. Not long afterward, a series of increasingly repressive measures are passed, and the Jews of Eliezer’s town are forced into small ghettos within Sighet. Soon they are herded onto cattle cars, and a nightmarish journey ensues. After days and nights crammed into the car, exhausted and near starvation, the passengers arrive at Birkenau, the gateway to Auschwitz.
Upon his arrival in Birkenau, Eliezer and his father are separated from his mother and sisters, whom they never see again. In the first of many “selections” that Eliezer describes in the memoir, the Jews are evaluated to determine whether they should be killed immediately or put to work. Eliezer and his father seem to pass the evaluation, but before they are brought to the prisoners’ barracks, they stumble upon the open-pit furnaces where the Nazis are burning babies by the truckload.
The Jewish arrivals are stripped, shaved, disinfected, and treated with almost unimaginable cruelty. Eventually, their captors march them from Birkenau to the main camp, Auschwitz. They eventually arrive in Buna, a work camp, where Eliezer is put to work in an electrical-fittings factory. Under slave-labor conditions, severely malnourished and decimated by the frequent “selections,” the Jews take solace in caring for each other, in religion, and in Zionism, a movement favoring the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine, considered the holy land. In the camp, the Jews are subject to beatings and repeated humiliations. A vicious foreman forces Eliezer to give him his gold tooth, which is pried out of his mouth with a rusty spoon.
The prisoners are forced to watch the hanging of fellow prisoners in the camp courtyard. On one occasion, the Gestapo even hang a small child who had been associated with some rebels within Buna. Because of the horrific conditions in the camps and the ever-present danger of death, many of the prisoners themselves begin to slide into cruelty, concerned only with personal survival. Sons begin to abandon and abuse their fathers. Eliezer himself begins to lose his humanity and his faith, both in God and in the people around him.
After months in the camp, Eliezer undergoes an operation for a foot injury. While he is in the infirmary, however, the Nazis decide to evacuate the camp because the Russians are advancing and are on the verge of liberating Buna. In the middle of a snowstorm, the prisoners begin a death march: they are forced to run for more than fifty miles to the Gleiwitz concentration camp. Many die of exposure to the harsh weather and exhaustion. At Gleiwitz, the prisoners are herded into cattle cars once again. They begin another deadly journey: one hundred Jews board the car, but only twelve remain alive when the train reaches the concentration camp Buchenwald. Throughout the ordeal, Eliezer and his father help each other to survive by means of mutual support and concern. In Buchenwald, however, Eliezer’s father dies of dysentery and physical abuse. Eliezer survives, an empty shell of a man until April 11, 1945, the day that the American army liberates the camp."
Serving,"In 1998, Barbara Ehrenreich, a journalist and activist then in her late 50s, sets out to document the daily struggles of America’s working poor. Having trained as a biologist, she decides to do fieldwork: in three different U.S. cities, she takes minimum-wage jobs and looks for affordable places to live. She leaves her Ph.D. and most of her skills off of her applications, to ensure that she is given the lowest-level positions available to a white, native-English speaking woman. However, she will use outside cash, if necessary, to ensure that she will never be without a car, she will not have to skip meals to save money, and she will never be homeless.
Ehrenreich’s first experiences are in Key West, Florida. Her most affordable living option, cheaper than a trailer in town, is a shabby efficiency apartment thirty miles away. Although she expects to earn $7 per hour, the first job she lands, as a diner waitress, pays much less, because she will also earn tips. The job requires not only serving tables but also additional work, like cleaning and restocking. Although Ehrenreich gets along well with her coworkers, she struggles as a waitress, because of her lack of experience. Realizing that she will not be able to stay in her apartment on what she is earning, she tries takes a second waitressing job, at another diner. She quickly realizes she will be physically unable to work both jobs, quits the first job, and takes a hotel housekeeping job next door to the second diner, instead. However, when her supervisor at the second diner yells at her, Ehrenreich has had enough and walks out.
Ehrenreich’s next location is Portland, Maine. There, after much searching, she finds a small apartment she will be able to afford. She takes two jobs. The first is with a maid service that cleans the homes of affluent clients where she works on a cleaning team with several other women. The work is back-breaking, and Ehrenreich develops a skin rash of unknown origin. She sees the other women continue to work even when they are injured or feeling sick. She notices that the cleaning techniques the team is taught to use are more about making homes look cleaner than about actually cleaning them. She learns that her employer charges customers $25 per person-hour, while she will earn $6.65 an hour. Ehrenreich’s other job is at a nursing home, where she helps serve food to residents with Alzheimer’s. The interactions with the residents are pleasant, but the cleanup work after meals is overwhelming, partly because one of the automatic dishwashers is broken.
In Minneapolis, Minnesota, finally, Ehrenreich has a very hard time finding safe, sanitary housing she can afford. A charity worker suggests that she check into a shelter while saving up first month’s rent. She has two job applications accepted, but backs out of one job, at a hardware store, when her very first shift is scheduled to last eleven hours without overtime pay. The other job is in women’s clothing at Wal-Mart. The day-long orientation for new employees includes criticism of labor unions, while the pay is less than typical for the area. The store layout is constantly changing, and customers make extra work for her by leaving unbought merchandise in other departments. The job makes Ehrenreich, by her own account, callous and spiteful. Meanwhile, she has been unable to secure a long-term rental situation. Fed up, at one of the employee meetings she starts talking about the need for a union. By now, she has already decided to quit.
Reviewing her experiences in light of the data from many different studies, Ehrenreich comes to several conclusions. She finds that workers cannot support themselves on minimum wage in America unless they work multiple jobs, and only so long as there are no unexpected expenses, such as for medical care. Ehrenreich also finds that employers try to keep information about the wages they pay from becoming general knowledge among workers. Additionally, she finds that the ways in which workers are supervised, including random urine tests for drug use, encourage the workers to accept being dehumanized. Ehrenreich adds that the attitudes found in managers of low-wage employees are based on class or racial prejudice. Finally, she states that medical benefits and child care are too expensive even for middle-class workers, let alone ones on minimum wage. She notes that perhaps someday the working poor will refuse to stop accepting their situation and will demand that things change—and concludes that the country will be a better place when they do."
Born,"In Born a Crime: Stories from a South African Childhood, comedian and television personality Trevor Noah gives a heartfelt and funny recounting of his experiences growing up in South Africa as an oppressed person. Stories of Noah’s life are interspersed with insights into South Africa’s culture, systems, and history. Noah was born in 1984 to a single mother, Patricia, during the time of racial segregation known as apartheid. Patricia was a strong, driven woman who paid little heed to the racist laws that oppressed her. Noah’s father, Robert, agreed to give Patricia a child during a time when sexual relationships between black and white South Africans were illegal. Robert, a Swiss immigrant, never supported segregation and did what he could to undermine apartheid. Because it was dangerous for Patricia and Robert to be seen with their mixed-race child, Noah recalls sometimes being momentarily abandoned by his parents in public settings.
Dutch colonizers came to South Africa in the 1600s and used slave labor to run their farms on stolen land. The white South Africans called Afrikaners are descended from these colonizers. Black South Africans, from tribes including the Zulu, Xhosa, and Sotho tribes, were subjugated under apartheid law until the mid-1990s. A third racial group emerged from the intermingling of the Black and white South Africans: mixed-race or “colored.” Both during apartheid and after its dissolution, mixed-race South Africans were the most marginalized and disenfranchised people. Noah often felt defined by what he wasn’t: not light enough to be labeled as white and not dark enough to be fully accepted into Black culture.
Apartheid ended in 1994, but Noah’s struggles as a mixed-race child in South Africa continued. It was often hard for Noah to determine which groups would accept him. Patricia had always encouraged her son to read and think independently; she valued education and made sure that her son spoke multiple languages. Of the eleven official languages in South Africa, Noah could speak Zulu, Tsonga, English, and Afrikaans. This skill allowed him to move among different racial and cultural groups at school. Though Noah felt out of place in many social settings, his ability to talk and empathize with many different types of people served him well throughout his life. Even at a young age, Noah understood that the bullying he experienced from his mixed-race peers was likely a result of the self-hatred all mixed-race South Africans had been taught. Noah was a mischievous child, but Patricia believed in tempering her punishments with assurances to her son that she held him accountable because she loved him. Patricia knew that the world would not always be kind and generous to Noah, and she wanted to prepare him well.
During his high school years, Noah acquired a small bootleg CD business from a friend. Noah soon found that he could make more money working with his friend Sizwe, who was from the poorer, crowded Johannesburg township called Alexandra—known to most residents as Alex. After graduation Noah moved to Alex to expand his profits, with Sizwe’s help. Sizwe recognized that Noah had talent as a live DJ, and the pair formed a performance group. Noah and his group sold bootleg and mixed CDs, dealt in stolen goods, performed at parties and concerts, and did their best to avoid confrontations with local law enforcement. Noah was already familiar with the South African police. Patricia received no help from the local police when she tried to file charges against her abusive husband. Noah was arrested for shoplifting, on suspicion of carrying a weapon, and for driving an unregistered vehicle. One arrest kept Noah in jail for several days, and Patricia had to pay for his lawyer. Despite his dealings with law enforcement, Noah could see his own privilege in comparison to many of his peers. Patricia had worked hard to make sure her son had the ability to make a life for himself.
The men in Noah’s life taught him little about how to interact with women. Robert was a distant but generally pleasant presence. Patricia’s father, Temperance Noah, was an unpredictable figure. Later, Noah would learn that his grandfather had bipolar disorder and would often beat his wife, Frances. Patricia experienced abuse in her marriage as well. Noah’s stepfather, Abel, became acquainted with Patricia and her young son during their many visits to the automotive shop where Abel worked on their run-down car. After Abel and Patricia married, he bought the shop. Patricia was forced to sell her home to keep the business running, and the family spent a stressful year living in the shop warehouse. Abel often came home drunk, and he began beating his wife. Once Abel had sons of his own, Noah’s half-brothers Andrew and Isaac, Abel’s hostility toward Patricia’s oldest son grew. When Patricia learned that her violent husband had bought a gun, she helped Noah move out on his own. 
One day, Noah received a phone call from Andrew with news that Abel, now estranged from his family, had come to Patricia’s new house and shot her in the head as she was shielding Andrew and Isaac. Miraculously, Patricia survived. Noah was able to cover her medical bills, and Patricia thanked God for protecting her and giving her a son who could afford to help her."
Moneys,"A Raisin in the Sun portrays a few weeks in the life of the Youngers, a Black family living on the South Side of Chicago in the 1950s. When the play opens, the Youngers are about to receive an insurance check for $10,000. This money comes from the deceased Mr. Younger’s life insurance policy. Each of the adult members of the family has an idea as to what he or she would like to do with this money. The matriarch of the family, Mama, wants to buy a house to fulfill a dream she shared with her husband. Mama’s son, Walter Lee, would rather use the money to invest in a liquor store with his friends. He believes that the investment will solve the family’s financial problems forever. Walter’s wife, Ruth, agrees with Mama, however, and hopes that she and Walter can provide more space and opportunity for their son, Travis. Finally, Beneatha, Walter’s sister and Mama’s daughter, wants to use the money for her medical school tuition. She also wishes that her family members were not so interested in assimilating into the white world. Beneatha instead tries to find her identity by looking back to the past and to Africa.
As the play progresses, the Youngers clash over their competing dreams. Ruth discovers that she is pregnant but fears that if she has the child, she will put more financial pressure on her family members. When Walter says nothing to Ruth’s admission that she is considering abortion, Mama puts a down payment on a house for the whole family. She believes that a bigger, brighter dwelling will help them all. This house is in Clybourne Park, an entirely white neighborhood. When the Youngers’ future neighbors find out that the Youngers are moving in, they send Mr. Lindner, from the Clybourne Park Improvement Association, to offer the Youngers money in return for staying away. The Youngers refuse the deal, even after Walter loses the rest of the money ($6,500) to his friend Willy Harris, who persuades Walter to invest in the liquor store and then runs off with his cash.
In the meantime, Beneatha rejects her suitor, George Murchison, whom she believes to be shallow and blind to the problems of race. Subsequently, she receives a marriage proposal from her Nigerian boyfriend, Joseph Asagai, who wants Beneatha to get a medical degree and move to Africa with him (Beneatha does not make her choice before the end of the play). The Youngers eventually move out of the apartment, fulfilling the family’s long-held dream. Their future seems uncertain and slightly dangerous, but they are optimistic and determined to live a better life. They believe that they can succeed if they stick together as a family and resolve to defer their dreams no longer."
Sovereignties,"On the morning of February 10, 1675, the British settlement of Lancaster, in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, is besieged by Native Americans. The attackers burn down houses and open fire on the settlers, wounding and killing several of them, and take a number of the survivors captive. Mary Rowlandson is one of the wounded, as is her youngest child, Sarah. Other members of Rowlandson’s family are killed outright. As the melee dies down, the Native Americans begin to lead their captives, including Rowlandson and her three children, from the settlement into the surrounding wilderness. At this point, Rowlandson and her two elder children are separated, but she and the youngest are allowed to remain together.
After a night spent in an abandoned town nearby, from which colonists had fled in fear of Indian attack, the captors and their captives begin to trek westward, farther into the forest. As Rowlandson and her daughter are both wounded, the journey is difficult and painful. After another day of travel, they reach an Indian settlement called Wenimesset. Here, Rowlandson meets another British captive, Robert Pepper, who wants to offer the new captives comfort. The Indians and their captives remain in Wenimesset for over a week, and during this time, Rowlandson’s wounded child becomes more ill, finally dying on February 18. By this time, Rowlandson’s original captor has sold her to a Saggamore Indian named Quannopin, who is related by marriage to King Philip. Quannopin oversees the burial of Rowlandson’s dead child, and a grieving Rowlandson visits her elder daughter (also named Mary), who she learns is also being held in Wenimesset. As she despairs over the fate of her family, her son visits her—he has been allowed to come from the nearby Indian settlement where he is being held in captivity. Meanwhile, the Indians continue to attack British towns, including Medfield, killing and looting as they go. Her captors give Rowlandson a Bible, part of the spoils of Medfield, and in it she finds comfort and hope.
After the fighting at Medfield, the Indians decide again to “remove” westward, now heading north as well. Rowlandson is again separated from her family and acquaintances. After a four-day rest in the forest, the band of Indians with whom Rowlandson is traveling begins to travel more swiftly. Rowlandson suspects that the British army must be close. They reach the Baquaug River and cross it, and the English arrive close behind. The British soldiers, however, are unable to ford the river, and the Indians and Rowlandson continue to the northwest. Rowlandson and her captors soon reach the Connecticut River, which they plan to cross in order to meet with King Philip. Here, however, are English scouts, and the Indians and Rowlandson are forced to scatter in the forest to remain undetected. Rowlandson again meets up with her son and his captors, though they must soon part ways.
After this detour, Rowlandson and the Indians cross the river, and on the other side, she meets with King Philip as planned. For some time, she remains at this settlement, sewing clothes for the Indians in return for food. The Indians, meanwhile, raid Northampton and return with spoils, including horses. Rowlandson asks to be taken to Albany on horseback, hoping that there she will be “sold” in exchange for gunpowder, but instead, the Indians prepare to take her northward and over the river once more.
After a brief sojourn at a settlement five miles north of King Philip’s abode, Rowlandson’s captors once again bring her north but then turn south again. Rowlandson hopes she’ll be returned home, but the Indians delay the journey, continuing south down the Connecticut River rather than turning east toward civilization. Indian attacks on British towns continue, and another captive, Thomas Read, joins Rowlandson’s group. From Read, Rowlandson learns that her husband is alive and well, which heartens her. Rowlandson also sees her son again, briefly. Rowlandson and her captors finally begin to move east.
They again cross the Baquaug River. Messengers meet them and report that Rowlandson must go to Wachuset, where the Indians will meet to discuss her possible return to freedom. More hopeful than she has been in some time, Rowlandson eagerly sets off toward the council’s meeting place. But the journey tires her, and she is disheartened by the sight of an injured colonist, wounded in still another Indian attack. At Wachuset, she speaks with King Philip, who promises her she’ll be free in two weeks. Nonetheless, the council continues to deliberate, asking Rowlandson how much her husband would be willing to pay them as ransom. The Indians then send a letter to Boston, stating that Rowlandson can be redeemed for twenty pounds. Meanwhile, attacks on British settlements continue, including an attack on Sudbury, after which Rowlandson must travel with her captors back into the forest.
As the Indians celebrate their victories, messengers arrive from the council, along with an Englishman named John Hoar. Rowlandson hopes she’ll be allowed to leave with Hoar, but negotiations continue for several more days. Rowlandson is finally allowed to travel back to now-abandoned Lancaster, then on to Concord, and finally to Boston. After nearly twelve weeks in the wilderness, Rowlandson is reunited with her husband. The two stay with a friend in Concord for eleven weeks, during which time Rowlandson’s sister is also released from her captivity. Rowlandson’s son and daughter are eventually returned as well. The family, together again at last, sets up a new household in Boston, where they continue to live until 1677."
Beneficent,"Beloved begins in 1873 in Cincinnati, Ohio, where Sethe, a former slave, has been living with her eighteen-year-old daughter Denver. Sethe’s mother-in-law, Baby Suggs, lived with them until her death eight years earlier. Just before Baby Suggs’s death, Sethe’s two sons, Howard and Buglar, ran away. Sethe believes they fled because of the malevolent presence of an abusive ghost that has haunted their house at 124 Bluestone Road for years. Denver, however, likes the ghost, which everyone believes to be the spirit of her dead sister.
On the day the novel begins, Paul D, whom Sethe has not seen since they worked together on Mr. Garner’s Sweet Home plantation in Kentucky approximately twenty years earlier, stops by Sethe’s house. His presence resurrects memories that have lain buried in Sethe’s mind for almost two decades. From this point on, the story will unfold on two temporal planes. The present in Cincinnati constitutes one plane, while a series of events that took place around twenty years earlier, mostly in Kentucky, constitutes the other. This latter plane is accessed and described through the fragmented flashbacks of the major characters. Accordingly, we frequently read these flashbacks several times, sometimes from varying perspectives, with each successive narration of an event adding a little more information to the previous ones.
From these fragmented memories, the following story begins to emerge: Sethe, the protagonist, was born in the South to an African mother she never knew. When she is thirteen, she is sold to the Garners, who own Sweet Home and practice a comparatively benevolent kind of slavery. There, the other slaves, who are all men, lust after her but never touch her. Their names are Sixo, Paul D, Paul A, Paul F, and Halle. Sethe chooses to marry Halle, apparently in part because he has proven generous enough to buy his mother’s freedom by hiring himself out on the weekends. Together, Sethe and Halle have two sons, Howard and Buglar, as well as a baby daughter whose name we never learn. When she leaves Sweet Home, Sethe is also pregnant with a fourth child. After the eventual death of the proprietor, Mr. Garner, the widowed Mrs. Garner asks her sadistic, vehemently racist brother-in-law to help her run the farm. He is known to the slaves as schoolteacher, and his oppressive presence makes life on the plantation even more unbearable than it had been before. The slaves decide to run.
Schoolteacher and his nephews anticipate the slaves’ escape, however, and capture Paul D and Sixo. Schoolteacher kills Sixo and brings Paul D back to Sweet Home, where Paul D sees Sethe for what he believes will be the last time. She is still intent on running, having already sent her children ahead to her mother-in-law Baby Suggs’s house in Cincinnati. Invigorated by the recent capture, schoolteacher’s nephews seize Sethe in the barn and violate her, stealing the milk her body is storing for her infant daughter. Unbeknownst to Sethe, Halle is watching the event from a loft above her, where he lies frozen with horror. Afterward, Halle goes mad: Paul D sees him sitting by a churn with butter slathered all over his face. Paul D, meanwhile, is forced to suffer the indignity of wearing an iron bit in his mouth.
When schoolteacher finds out that Sethe has reported his and his nephews’ misdeeds to Mrs. Garner, he has her whipped severely, despite the fact that she is pregnant. Swollen and scarred, Sethe nevertheless runs away, but along the way she collapses from exhaustion in a forest. A white girl, Amy Denver, finds her and nurses her back to health. When Amy later helps Sethe deliver her baby in a boat, Sethe names this second daughter Denver after the girl who helped her. Sethe receives further help from Stamp Paid, who rows her across the Ohio River to Baby Suggs’s house. Baby Suggs cleans Sethe up before allowing her to see her three older children.
Sethe spends twenty-eight wonderful days in Cincinnati, where Baby Suggs serves as an unofficial preacher to the black community. On the last day, however, schoolteacher comes for Sethe to take her and her children back to Sweet Home. Rather than surrender her children to a life of dehumanizing slavery, she flees with them to the woodshed and tries to kill them. Only the third child, her older daughter, dies, her throat having been cut with a handsaw by Sethe. Sethe later arranges for the baby’s headstone to be carved with the word “Beloved.” The sheriff takes Sethe and Denver to jail, but a group of white abolitionists, led by the Bodwins, fights for her release. Sethe returns to the house at 124, where Baby Suggs has sunk into a deep depression. The community shuns the house, and the family continues to live in isolation.
Meanwhile, Paul D has endured torturous experiences in a chain gang in Georgia, where he was sent after trying to kill Brandywine, a slave owner to whom he was sold by schoolteacher. His traumatic experiences have caused him to lock away his memories, emotions, and ability to love in the “tin tobacco box” of his heart. One day, a fortuitous rainstorm allows Paul D and the other chain gang members to escape. He travels northward by following the blossoming spring flowers. Years later, he ends up on Sethe’s porch in Cincinnati.
Paul D’s arrival at 124 commences the series of events taking place in the present time frame. Prior to moving in, Paul D chases the house’s resident ghost away, which makes the already lonely Denver resent him from the start. Sethe and Paul D look forward to a promising future together, until one day, on their way home from a carnival, they encounter a strange young woman sleeping near the steps of 124. Most of the characters believe that the woman—who calls herself Beloved—is the embodied spirit of Sethe’s dead daughter, and the novel provides a wealth of evidence supporting this interpretation. Denver develops an obsessive attachment to Beloved, and Beloved’s attachment to Sethe is equally if not more intense. Paul D and Beloved hate each other, and Beloved controls Paul D by moving him around the house like a rag doll and by seducing him against his will.
When Paul D learns the story of Sethe’s “rough choice”—her infanticide—he leaves 124 and begins sleeping in the basement of the local church. In his absence, Sethe and Beloved’s relationship becomes more intense and exclusive. Beloved grows increasingly abusive, manipulative, and parasitic, and Sethe is obsessed with satisfying Beloved’s demands and making her understand why she murdered her. Worried by the way her mother is wasting away, Denver leaves the premises of 124 for the first time in twelve years in order to seek help from Lady Jones, her former teacher. The community provides the family with food and eventually organizes under the leadership of Ella, a woman who had worked on the Underground Railroad and helped with Sethe’s escape, in order to exorcise Beloved from 124. When they arrive at Sethe’s house, they see Sethe on the porch with Beloved, who stands smiling at them, naked and pregnant. Mr. Bodwin, who has come to 124 to take Denver to her new job, arrives at the house. Mistaking him for schoolteacher, Sethe runs at Mr. Bodwin with an ice pick. She is restrained, but in the confusion Beloved disappears, never to return.
Afterward, Paul D comes back to Sethe, who has retreated to Baby Suggs’s bed to die. Mourning Beloved, Sethe laments, “She was my best thing.” But Paul D replies, “You your best thing, Sethe.” The novel then ends with a warning that “[t]his is not a story to pass on.” The town, and even the residents of 124, have forgotten Beloved “[l]ike an unpleasant dream during a troubling sleep.”"
Beneficial,"Wang Lung is a poor young farmer in rural, turn-of-the-century China. During the time in which the novel takes place, Chinese society is showing signs of modernization while remaining deeply connected to ancient traditions and customs. When Wang Lung reaches a marriageable age, his father approaches the powerful local Hwang family to ask if they have a spare slave who could marry his son. The Hwangs agree to sell Wang a 20-year-old slave named O-lan, who becomes his wife. O-lan and Wang Lung are pleased with each other, although they exchange few words and although Wang is initially disappointed that O-lan does not have bound feet.
Together, Wang Lung and O-lan cultivate a bountiful and profitable harvest from their land. O-lan becomes pregnant, and Wang Lung is overjoyed when O-lan’s first child is a son. Meanwhile, the powerful Hwang family lives decadently—the husband is obsessed with women, and the wife is an opium addict. Because of their costly habits, the Hwangs fall on hard times, and Wang Lung is able to purchase a piece of their fertile rice land. He enjoys another profitable harvest, and O-lan gives birth to another son. Wang Lung’s new wealth catches the attention of his greedy, lazy uncle. Custom dictates that Wang Lung must show the utmost respect to members of the older generation, especially relatives, so he is forced to loan his uncle money despite knowing that the money will be wasted on drinking and gambling. The Hwang family’s finances continue to falter, and the Hwangs sell another tract of land to Wang Lung.
After O-lan gives birth to a daughter, a terrible famine settles on the land. In the midst of this crisis, O-lan gives birth to another daughter. She strangles the second girl because there is not enough food to feed the baby and the rest of the family. Wang Lung is forced to take his family to a southern city for the winter. There, O-lan and the children beg while Wang Lung earns money by transporting people in a rented rickshaw. They earn just enough money to eat. Wang Lung begins to despair of ever making enough money to return to his land. He and O-lan briefly consider selling their surviving daughter as a slave. Eventually, a group of poor and desperate people ransacks a rich man’s home, and Wang Lung and O-lan join them. Wang Lung steals a pile of gold coins. With this new wealth, he moves the family back home and purchases a new ox and some seeds. O-lan had stolen some jewels during the looting. Wang Lung allows her to keep two small pearls, but he takes the rest and hurries to buy three hundred acres of Old Master Hwang’s land. O-lan gives birth to twins shortly thereafter. The couple realizes that their oldest daughter has severe intellectual disabilities, but Wang Lung loves the child dearly.
Wang Lung hires laborers to plant and harvest his land. He enjoys several years of profitable harvests and becomes a rich man. When a flood forces him to be idle, he begins to feel restless and bored. He finds fault with O-lan’s appearance and cruelly criticizes her for having big feet. He becomes obsessed with Lotus, a beautiful, delicate prostitute with bound feet. Eventually, he purchases Lotus to be his concubine. When O-lan becomes terminally ill, Wang Lung regrets his cruel words and comes to appreciate everything his wife has done for him. Meanwhile, to lessen the demands of his uncle and his uncle’s wife, who have moved their family into his house and continued to exploit his wealth, he tricks them into becoming opium addicts. Eventually, Wang Lung rents the Hwangs’ house and moves into it with his family, leaving his own house to his uncle’s family.
After O-lan’s death, Wang Lung’s sons begin to rebel against his plans for their life. They do not want to work as farmers and do not have his devotion to the land. Furthermore, his first and second sons often argue over money, and their wives develop an intense animosity toward one another. In his old age, Wang Lung takes a young slave, Pear Blossom, as a concubine. She promises to care for his disabled daughter after his death. In time, Wang Lung is surrounded by grandchildren, but he is also surrounded by petty family disagreements. By the end of the novel, despite Wang’s passionate dissent, his sons plan to sell the family land and divide the money among themselves, signaling their final break with the land that made them wealthy."
Unfair,"Lawyer Bryan Stevenson gives a first-person account of his decades helping marginalized Americans who have been unfairly and harshly punished by the U.S. criminal justice system, which disproportionately targets people of color and poor people. At the heart of Just Mercy is the story of Walter McMillian, a Black man who was framed for the murder of a girl named Ronda Morrison, convicted, and sent to death row. 
Stevenson alternates chapters about Walter with his personal reflections on our country’s history with racial disparity and issues around incarceration. Stevenson highlights other groups of vulnerable people who have been victimized by the criminal justice system and shares the stories of the prisoners he has helped over the years. The book also follows the growth of Stevenson’s nonprofit law project, the Alabama-based Equal Justice Initiative (EJI), through its expansion from focusing on death row prisoners to helping people sentenced to life without parole. Stevenson chronicles how EJI becomes a significant force in criminal justice reform.
In 1983 as a law student, Stevenson discovers his life’s passion when he interns with the Georgia-based Southern Prisoners Defense Committee and meets his first death row prisoner. After graduation Stevenson accepts a job with the organization to represent poor prisoners, including those in Alabama who lack any public defender. He meets Walter McMillian on Alabama’s death row. Walter owns a successful business but also transgresses racial boundaries when he has an affair with a white woman. Soon after the affair becomes public, the woman’s friend, Ralph Myers, accuses Walter of committing the unsolved murder of Ronda Morrison, which has outraged the community. Law enforcement, including a racist sheriff and the district attorney, eagerly pounces on this accusation, overlooking Walter’s alibi and a lack of evidence. Instead, they actively force Ralph to stick with his story even when he tries to recant. They coerce other false witness testimonies, and—as revealed years later—actively suppress evidence.
After Stevenson and the team at EJI unsuccessfully appeal Walter’s conviction, they launch their own investigation of the crime and uncover new evidence. They find witnesses who can prove the witnesses against Walter lied as well as financial records that indicate that one of these witnesses was paid to give false testimony. Stevenson and his team also petition for and receive all records from Walter’s trial. However, their big break comes when they receive a phone call from Ralph, who now wants to make amends. Ralph admits to lying about Walter and says he was threatened by law enforcement. Stevenson wins a hearing for Walter where he can present his new evidence: Ralph’s testimony, which is confirmed by health care workers and other inmates, as well as recordings of the law enforcement team threatening Ralph if he doesn’t frame Walter. 
While the judge refuses to grant Walter relief, Stevenson continues the appeal process through the Alabama courts. The district attorney asks outside agents to investigate the murder for which Walter was convicted, and the investigators determine that Walter had nothing to do with the crime. Six weeks later, the court invalidates Walter’s conviction. Stevenson and the State file a joint motion to dismiss the charges, and Walter is set free.
Throughout the process, Stevenson and Walter become close friends, and Stevenson helps Walter upon his release, including filing a civil suit on his behalf and offering him a place to stay. Walter works with Stevenson to share his story, giving interviews and speaking at legal conferences, and Walter is even featured in a documentary. Unfortunately, Walter is diagnosed with advancing dementia and is forced to rely on family and eventually a nursing facility for his care. He dies in 2013. Stevenson gives a eulogy at his funeral and shares all he learned from Walter, particularly that we must extend mercy to everyone, even those who have not earned it.
Interspersed with chapters chronicling Walter’s narrative are stories of Stevenson’s other clients and work. His closeness with these prisoners and their horrifying circumstances makes Stevenson more determined to help and causes him to reflect on abstract issues that nevertheless imbue the criminal justice system, like humanity and mercy. Stevenson focuses on several categories of vulnerable people who become trapped in the system, including mentally ill prisoners, disabled prisoners, and poor women who give birth to stillborn babies. 
Stevenson and his team at EJI also become increasingly focused on juvenile offenders who are sometimes tried as adults despite their young age. These offenders may be given de facto death sentences by being sentenced to life without parole and face perilous circumstances when they are housed in adult prisons. Stevenson illustrates how these prisoners retain their own humanity while being forced to live under inhumane conditions. He also discusses some of the qualities common among these types of prisoners: They are generally poor and disproportionately people of color, and most of them lack adequate legal counsel. The juveniles have horrific backgrounds of abuse and neglect.
Stevenson and his team at EJI also work to change the legal system to offer more protection to marginalized people. Several of his cases end up before the U.S. Supreme Court, and he succeeds in winning rulings that ban as unconstitutional the conviction of children to life without parole and the execution of people deemed incompetent from dementia or neurological disease. EJI works to raise public awareness of issues surrounding unfair incarceration, produces groundbreaking reports on racial issues, and sets up programs to help formerly incarcerated people adjust to life on the outside.
Stevenson also reflects on the issues that surround the criminal justice system. His time spent with prisoners awaiting their execution makes him realize how inhumane it is to prepare another human to die. After decades of work, when Stevenson fails to prevent the execution of a man who suffers from an intellectual disability, he momentarily feels unable to continue his work. However, he realizes that he cannot help but be broken by his experiences and comes to understand that it is his own brokenness that allows him to more fully understand the need for mercy and to bring compassion to others. The book ends with Stevenson’s renewed commitment to helping others."
Capital,"Guy Montag is a fireman who burns books in a futuristic American city. In Montag’s world, firemen start fires rather than putting them out. The people in this society do not read books, enjoy nature, spend time by themselves, think independently, or have meaningful conversations. Instead, they drive very fast, watch excessive amounts of television on wall-size sets, and listen to the radio on “Seashell Radio” sets attached to their ears.
Montag encounters a gentle seventeen-year-old girl named Clarisse McClellan, who opens his eyes to the emptiness of his life with her innocently penetrating questions and her unusual love of people and nature. Over the next few days, Montag experiences a series of disturbing events. First, his wife, Mildred, attempts suicide by swallowing a bottle of sleeping pills. Then, when he responds to an alarm that an old woman has a stash of hidden literature, the woman shocks him by choosing to be burned alive along with her books. A few days later, he hears that Clarisse has been killed by a speeding car. Montag’s dissatisfaction with his life increases, and he begins to search for a solution in a stash of books that he has stolen from his own fires and hidden inside an air-conditioning vent.
When Montag fails to show up for work, his fire chief, Beatty, pays a visit to his house. Beatty explains that it’s normal for a fireman to go through a phase of wondering what books have to offer, and he delivers a dizzying monologue explaining how books came to be banned in the first place. According to Beatty, special-interest groups and other “minorities” objected to books that offended them. Soon, books all began to look the same, as writers tried to avoid offending anybody. This was not enough, however, and society as a whole decided to simply burn books rather than permit conflicting opinions. Beatty tells Montag to take twenty-four hours or so to see if his stolen books contain anything worthwhile and then turn them in for incineration. Montag begins a long and frenzied night of reading.
Overwhelmed by the task of reading, Montag looks to his wife for help and support, but she prefers television to her husband’s company and cannot understand why he would want to take the terrible risk of reading books. He remembers that he once met a retired English professor named Faber sitting in a park, and he decides that this man might be able to help him understand what he reads. He visits Faber, who tells him that the value of books lies in the detailed awareness of life that they contain. Faber says that Montag needs not only books but also the leisure to read them and the freedom to act upon their ideas.
Faber agrees to help Montag with his reading, and they concoct a risky scheme to overthrow the status quo. Faber will contact a printer and begin reproducing books, and Montag will plant books in the homes of firemen to discredit the profession and to destroy the machinery of censorship. Faber gives him a two-way radio earpiece (the “green bullet”) so that he can hear what Montag hears and talk to him secretly.
Montag goes home, and soon two of his wife’s friends arrive to watch television. The women discuss their families and the war that is about to be declared in an extremely frivolous manner. Their superficiality angers him, and he takes out a book of poetry and reads “Dover Beach” by Matthew Arnold. Faber buzzes in his ear for him to be quiet, and Mildred tries to explain that the poetry reading is a standard way for firemen to demonstrate the uselessness of literature. The women are extremely disturbed by the poem and leave to file a complaint against Montag.
Montag goes to the fire station and hands over one of his books to Beatty. Beatty confuses Montag by barraging him with contradictory quotations from great books. Beatty exploits these contradictions to show that literature is morbid and dangerously complex, and that it deserves incineration. Suddenly, the alarm sounds, and they rush off to answer the call, only to find that the alarm is at Montag’s own house. Mildred gets into a cab with her suitcase, and Montag realizes that his own wife has betrayed him.
Beatty forces Montag to burn the house himself; when he is done, Beatty places him under arrest. When Beatty continues to berate Montag, Montag turns the flamethrower on his superior and proceeds to burn him to ashes. Montag knocks the other firemen unconscious and runs. The Mechanical Hound, a monstrous machine that Beatty has set to attack Montag, pounces and injects Montag’s leg with a large dose of anesthetic. Montag manages to destroy it with his flamethrower; then he walks off the numbness in his leg and escapes with some books that were hidden in his backyard. He hides these in another fireman’s house and calls in an alarm from a pay phone.
Montag goes to Faber’s house, where he learns that a new Hound has been put on his trail, along with several helicopters and a television crew. Faber tells Montag that he is leaving for St. Louis to see a retired printer who may be able to help them. Montag gives Faber some money and tells him how to remove Montag’s scent from his house so the Hound will not enter it. Montag then takes some of Faber’s old clothes and runs off toward the river. The whole city watches as the chase unfolds on TV, but Montag manages to escape in the river and change into Faber’s clothes to disguise his scent. He drifts downstream into the country and follows a set of abandoned railroad tracks until he finds a group of renegade intellectuals (“the Book People”), led by a man named Granger, who welcome him. They are a part of a nationwide network of book lovers who have memorized many great works of literature and philosophy. They hope that they may be of some help to mankind in the aftermath of the war that has just been declared. Montag’s role is to memorize the Book of Ecclesiastes. Enemy jets appear in the sky and completely obliterate the city with bombs. Montag and his new friends move on to search for survivors and rebuild civilization."
Bewildered,"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern wander through a featureless wilderness, flipping coins, which keep coming up heads. Each time a coin lands on heads, Rosencrantz wins it. While Guildenstern worries about the improbability of a coin landing on heads so many times in a row, Rosencrantz happily continues flipping. Guildenstern wonders if they have entered a world where the laws of chance and time are absent. The pair struggles to recall why they are traveling and remember only that a messenger called them.
They encounter a troupe of actors, known as the Tragedians. The leader of the group, called the Player, indicates that the Tragedians specialize in sexual performances and gives Rosencrantz and Guildenstern the chance to participate for a fee. Guildenstern turns the improbable coin-flipping episode to their advantage by offering the Player a bet. The Player loses but claims he cannot pay. Guildenstern asks for a play instead. Guildenstern starts to leave as the Tragedians prepare, and Rosencrantz reveals that the most recently flipped coin landed tails-up.
The scene changes suddenly. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are now inside Elsinore, the royal castle of Denmark, watching as Hamlet and Ophelia burst onstage and leave in opposite directions. Mistaking Rosencrantz for Guildenstern, Claudius explains that he sent for the pair so that they could ascertain what is bothering Hamlet, their childhood friend.
Bewildered, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern discuss how they might probe Hamlet for the cause of his supposed madness. They play a game of question-and-answer, further confusing themselves about their purpose and even their identities. Guildenstern suggests that he pretend to be Hamlet while Rosencrantz questions him. They realize that Hamlet’s disturbed state is due to the fact that his father, the former king of Denmark, has recently died, and the throne has been usurped by Hamlet’s uncle, Claudius, who also has married Hamlet’s mother, Gertrude. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern overhear Hamlet speaking riddles to Polonius.
Hamlet confuses Rosencrantz and Guildenstern with an enigmatic speech. Polonius comes in to tell Hamlet that the Tragedians have arrived. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern despair about how little they learned of Hamlet’s feelings. They cannot decide whether he is insane.
Polonius, Hamlet, and the Tragedians enter, and Hamlet announces that there will be a play the next day. Hamlet leaves, and Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and the Player discuss the possible causes of Hamlet’s strange behavior. The Player departs while Rosencrantz and Guildenstern discuss what happens after death.
As Claudius, Gertrude, Polonius, and Ophelia enter, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern explain that Hamlet wants them all to attend the play. The group leaves, but Hamlet enters. Not noticing Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, Hamlet wonders whether he should commit suicide. Ophelia enters, praying. After a short conversation, she and Hamlet exit.
Alfred, one of the Tragedians, arrives dressed as Gertrude. The other Tragedians enter to rehearse their play, which parallels Claudius’s rise to power and marriage to Gertrude. Ophelia enters, crying, followed by an angry Hamlet, who tells her to become a nun, then quickly departs. Claudius and Polonius enter and leave with Ophelia. The Player explains the tragic aspects of the Tragedians’ play, which metaphorically retells the recent events at Elsinore and foreshadows the deaths of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. They discuss whether death can be adequately represented on stage. The scene goes black.
In darkness, voices indicate that the play has disturbed Claudius. The next day, Claudius and Gertrude ask Rosencrantz and Guildenstern to find Hamlet, who has killed Polonius. Alone again, the pair concocts a plan to trap Hamlet with their belts, but they fail as Hamlet enters from an unexpected direction and immediately leaves, carrying the dead Polonius. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern call Hamlet back, but he refuses to say what he has done with Polonius’s body. Hamlet accuses Rosencrantz and Guildenstern of being Claudius’s tools. Hamlet escapes as Claudius enters, only to be brought back onstage under guard. The scene shifts outdoors, where Guildenstern tells Rosencrantz that they have to escort Hamlet to England. Hamlet arrives in conversation with a soldier. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern reluctantly depart.
On the boat to England, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern wonder where they are and whether they might be dead. They notice Hamlet sleeping nearby, remember their mission, and consider what to do when they arrive. Guildenstern has a letter from Claudius, which reveals that Hamlet is to be executed in England. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern cannot decide what to do.
As the pair sleeps, Hamlet switches the letter they were carrying with one he has written. The next morning, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern awake and hear music coming from barrels onboard the ship. To their surprise, the Tragedians emerge from the barrels just before pirates charge the ship. Hamlet, the Player, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern jump into the barrels, and the lights go down.
When the lights come back up, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and the Player come out of the barrels. Hamlet is gone. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern tell the Player about the letter and rehearse what they will say to the English king. Guildenstern discovers that the letter now states that Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are to be executed. The Tragedians encircle the pair. Despairing about his fate, Guildenstern takes a knife from the Player and stabs him. The Player cries out and falls, apparently dead. The Tragedians clap as the Player jumps up. He says that his death was a mediocre performance while showing Guildenstern that the knife was actually a stage prop.
The Player describes the different deaths that his troupe can perform while the Tragedians act out those deaths onstage. Rosencrantz applauds, and the light shifts, leaving Rosencrantz and Guildenstern alone. Rosencrantz breaks down and leaves as he realizes his death is near. Guildenstern wonders how they were caught in this situation, lamenting that they failed to seize an opportunity to avert their fate. Guildenstern exits.
The light changes, revealing the dead bodies of Claudius, Gertrude, Hamlet, and Laertes. Horatio arrives and delivers the final speech of Shakespeare’s Hamlet, as the music rises and lights fall."
Receding,"In Persepolis 2: The Story of a Return, Marjane Satrapi resumes the autobiographical account of her life that she began in Persepolis: The Story of a Childhood. The earlier book ended in 1984 with fourteen-year-old “Marji” tearfully saying goodbye to her mother and father at the Tehran airport after her parents decided it would be safer for her go to school in Vienna than to remain in Iran and live under a repressive regime while the country engaged in a bitter war with Iraq.  As Persepolis 2 begins, Marji is in Vienna preparing to enter a French-language school to resume her studies, but she is not living with the émigré family of her mother’s best friend, Zozo, as was planned. Zozo didn’t want Marji living with her family, so she quickly moved Marji to a boarding house run by Catholic nuns, where Marji knows no one and feels very alone.
Marji’s displacement to a boarding house is just the first of many challenges that strong-spirited but vulnerable Marji will face in Vienna over the next four years as she navigates being a teen-aged refugee adjusting from traditionalist Iran to the very Western city of Vienna. In the second half of Persepolis 2, Marji will return to Tehran and face the reverse challenge: she will try to readjust to life back in Iran after four formative years in Vienna. These dual challenges will take a heavy toll on Marji’s psyche as well as severely test, strain, and in some cases destroy her relationships with her family and friends—including her parents, her grandmother, fellow students, childhood acquaintances, boyfriends, and her fiancé and eventual husband. As Marji puts it: “I was a Westerner in Iran, an Iranian in the West. I had no identity. I didn’t even know why I was living.”
Marji’s stay at the Viennese boarding house gets off to a mixed start. Her roommate, Lucia, is a friendly girl from the Tyrol region of Austria, but communication is an issue since Marji and Lucia don’t share a common language and because Lucia is somewhat oblivious to Marji’s sensitivities. Her sensitivities are tested by the communal living arrangements, which Marji has trouble adjusting to after her comfortable home life with her well-off parents. But Lucia comes to Marji’s rescue when she invites her to spend Christmas break with her hospitable family in Tyrol. During the next school break, Marji stays at the boarding house and has a run-in with the mother superior that results in Marji getting kicked out. The mother superior insults Marji’s Iranian heritage, and Marji responds with an insult questioning the nuns’ virtue. 
At school, Marji experiences ups and downs as well. After being ignored by the other students, Marji gains some popularity with her mathematical and tutoring abilities. Her artistic talents also garner attention when she draws caricatures of the teachers. But it’s Marji’s status as a refugee who has “known war” that attracts a set of friends who give Marji her first taste of belonging in Vienna. The group is led by an older French girl named Julie, and its most conspicuous member is a mildly obnoxious punk boy named Momo who Marji tolerates through gritted teeth as he spouts pseudo-intellectual ideas.
After Marji is evicted by the nuns, Julie and her mother Armelle invite her to live with them and share Julie’s bedroom. Marji, who comes from a society that reveres parents, and who deeply misses her own mother, is shocked to see Julie ignore and disrespect Armelle. Marji spends time with Armelle and likes her, especially when she learns that Armelle knows Iranian culture, which is rare among Westerners. Julie’s worldliness (she’s sexually active and takes birth control pills) has a big impact on Marji, who envies and judges Julie simultaneously. While Armelle is traveling, Julie throws a party that is unlike any Marji has ever seen. Rather than eating or talking, the guests smoke and make out. When one guest stays and has sex with Julie, an astonished Marji calls it her first step into being assimilated into Western culture. 
Under her friend’s influence, Marji increasingly adopts the ways of Western youth and culture and worries that she’s losing her Iranian identity. At the same time, Marji undergoes significant physical changes in a growth spurt. She changes her hair, make-up, and clothes style as well. Trying to fit in, Marji now smokes and does drugs. When Julie and Armelle move away from Vienna, Marji sublets a room in a house. During that time, the now sixteen-year-old Marji is visited by her mother. Marji, who now towers over her mother, limits what she tells her mother about her life in Vienna, and her mother doesn’t divulge much about what her family’s life is like back in Iran either. The visit gives Marji a much-needed boost that at least temporarily forestalls more emotional spiraling. 
Marji takes a room in the home of a “Frau Doctor Heller,” a horrible person who adds stress to Marji’s life. Marji finds some solace in being with her boyfriend, a student named Markus. They will date for two years, but it’s never the idyllic relationship Marji wants. After Markus’s mother insults Marji by saying that she’s using him to get a passport, and then cuts off Markus’s allowance, Marji has to finance their dates. Marji also buys the drugs they smoke together, an arrangement that leads to Marji buying and then reselling drugs to other students at their school. Still, Marji grows increasingly dependent on Marcus for emotional support. Marji’s drug dealing ends when the school principal threatens her with expulsion. Her relationship with Markus also ends abruptly when she finds him in bed with another girl.
At this moment of extreme emotional vulnerability, and with right-wing, anti-immigrant sentiments on the rise in Austria, Marji’s landlady accuses her of theft. Marji storms out and spends the next two months on the streets until she ends up in a hospital. Soon after, her parents call and arrange for her to come back to Iran. Marji puts on a veil for the first time in four years and heads to the airport.
When Marji returns to Iran in 1988, the long war with Iraq has ended, but the fundamentalist Islamic regime continues to oppress Iranians with strict social and religious rules and severe punishments. Still recovering from her breakdown in Vienna, Marji tries to recede into the shadows, but her parents, family, and old friends won’t allow it, and Marji is gradually coaxed back into social interactions. Marji’s relationship with her parents has matured, but she still relies on them for advice and for emotional and financial support. Marji’s close relationship with her grandmother resumes, although there is a period when her grandmother won’t speak to her after Marji commits a selfish act that offends her.
Marji won’t mention her problems in Vienna since she feels deep guilt over having fled Iran while others faced the war and other difficulties. Marji feels that her problems in Vienna were inconsequential in comparison. Marji is keenly aware that Iran changed for the worse while she was away. Reminders of the war are everywhere, and the people are now too tired and fearful to stand up to the authorities. Women have it particularly bad in male-dominated Iran, and Marji has difficulty tolerating her old friends who seem vapid and obsessed with Western superficialities, at least in private. Publicly, women are obliged to hide themselves both physically (behind the veil) and intellectually.
Marji’s mother persuades her to seek the help of a psychoanalyst, and Marji tries several before one suggests that she take medication to combat her depression. The anti-depressants make her feel more hopeless, and Marji attempts suicide by swallowing a lot of pills. When Marji unexpectedly survives, she decides it’s a sign that she needs to make big changes in her life, so she alters her look, takes up aerobics, and feels vital for the first time in years. She goes to a party where she meets Reza, an ex-soldier who is now an artist. They’ll eventually marry, but first they decide to go back to school. 
Like all institutions in Iran, the art school that Marji and Reza attend is tightly controlled by the regime. Over time, the couple become part of a faction of students that react to the repression by violating rules on social behavior in private places—particularly by holding alcohol-fueled parties at each other’s homes. The parties are sometimes raided, resulting in arrests and stiff fines that the students’ parents must pay. When a friend of Marji and Reza’s dies in a fall while fleeing the authorities after a raid, Reza vows to stop going to parties, but Marji decides to party more.  Marji and Reza haven’t ever been a very compatible couple, and they argue endlessly. For a while, Marji chooses to celebrate their differences as opposites attracting, but their rifts only increase over time.
In spite of their disagreements, when Reza proposes to Marji she accepts. Marji’s father supports this arrangement even though he believes they aren’t compatible, since he knows that living together is the only way couples can get to know each other in their repressive society. Marji’s parents throw a huge wedding for their only daughter, but when Marji and Reza continue to disagree, Marji realizes their marriage is probably doomed. They stay married, although unhappily and with separate bedrooms, as they continue at school. Toward the end of their four-year program, Marji and Reza are assigned to work together on the final project. For seven months they happily collaborate without arguing on an ambitious theme park plan for Tehran based on figures from Persian mythology. Once the plan is completed and earns them perfect scores, Marji tries to make the plan a reality. But the authorities reject the plan because it is Persian, not Islamic. Marji realizes that she and Reza must divorce, and she must leave Iran.
Marji informs her parents, and they agree. Her father reflects by saying that as Iranians they are crushed, “not only by the government, but by the weight of our own traditions.” Marji is accepted into an arts program in Strasbourg, France, then must wait three months for a student visa. She cherishes her final months with her mother, father, and grandmother in the country that she instinctively loves but cannot remain in. This story ends like the prior book, with Marji at the Tehran airport saying goodbye to her family."
With,"Jack Worthing, the play’s protagonist, is a pillar of the community in Hertfordshire, where he is guardian to Cecily Cardew, the pretty, eighteen-year-old granddaughter of the late Thomas Cardew, who found and adopted Jack when he was a baby. In Hertfordshire, Jack has responsibilities: he is a major landowner and justice of the peace, with tenants, farmers, and a number of servants and other employees all dependent on him. For years, he has also pretended to have an irresponsible black-sheep brother named Ernest who leads a scandalous life in pursuit of pleasure and is always getting into trouble of a sort that requires Jack to rush grimly off to his assistance. In fact, Ernest is merely Jack’s alibi, a phantom that allows him to disappear for days at a time and do as he likes. No one but Jack knows that he himself is Ernest. Ernest is the name Jack goes by in London, which is where he really goes on these occasions—probably to pursue the very sort of behavior he pretends to disapprove of in his imaginary brother.
Jack is in love with Gwendolen Fairfax, the cousin of his best friend, Algernon Moncrieff. When the play opens, Algernon, who knows Jack as Ernest, has begun to suspect something, having found an inscription inside Jack’s cigarette case addressed to “Uncle Jack” from someone who refers to herself as “little Cecily.” Algernon suspects that Jack may be leading a double life, a practice he seems to regard as commonplace and indispensable to modern life. He calls a person who leads a double life a “Bunburyist,” after a nonexistent friend he pretends to have, a chronic invalid named Bunbury, to whose deathbed he is forever being summoned whenever he wants to get out of some tiresome social obligation.
At the beginning of Act 1, Jack drops in unexpectedly on Algernon and announces that he intends to propose to Gwendolen. Algernon confronts him with the cigarette case and forces him to come clean, demanding to know who “Jack” and “Cecily” are. Jack confesses that his name isn’t really Ernest and that Cecily is his ward, a responsibility imposed on him by his adoptive father’s will. Jack also tells Algernon about his fictional brother. Jack says he’s been thinking of killing off this fake brother, since Cecily has been showing too active an interest in him. Without meaning to, Jack describes Cecily in terms that catch Algernon’s attention and make him even more interested in her than he is already.
Gwendolen and her mother, Lady Bracknell, arrive, which gives Jack an opportunity to propose to Gwendolen. Jack is delighted to discover that Gwendolen returns his affections, but he is alarmed to learn that Gwendolen is fixated on the name Ernest, which she says “inspires absolute confidence.” Gwendolen makes clear that she would not consider marrying a man who was not named Ernest.
Lady Bracknell interviews Jack to determine his eligibility as a possible son-in-law, and during this interview she asks about his family background. When Jack explains that he has no idea who his parents were and that he was found, by the man who adopted him, in a handbag in the cloakroom at Victoria Station, Lady Bracknell is scandalized. She forbids the match between Jack and Gwendolen and sweeps out of the house.
In Act 2, Algernon shows up at Jack’s country estate posing as Jack’s brother Ernest. Meanwhile, Jack, having decided that Ernest has outlived his usefulness, arrives home in deep mourning, full of a story about Ernest having died suddenly in Paris. He is enraged to find Algernon there masquerading as Ernest but has to go along with the charade. If he doesn’t, his own lies and deceptions will be revealed.
While Jack changes out of his mourning clothes, Algernon, who has fallen hopelessly in love with Cecily, asks her to marry him. He is surprised to discover that Cecily already considers that they are engaged, and he is charmed when she reveals that her fascination with “Uncle Jack’s brother” led her to invent an elaborate romance between herself and him several months ago. Algernon is less enchanted to learn that part of Cecily’s interest in him derives from the name Ernest, which, unconsciously echoing Gwendolen, she says “inspires absolute confidence.”
Algernon goes off in search of Dr. Chasuble, the local rector, to see about getting himself christened Ernest. Meanwhile, Gwendolen arrives, having decided to pay Jack an unexpected visit. Gwendolen is shown into the garden, where Cecily orders tea and attempts to play hostess. Cecily has no idea how Gwendolen figures into Jack’s life, and Gwendolen, for her part, has no idea who Cecily is. Gwendolen initially thinks Cecily is a visitor to the Manor House and is disconcerted to learn that Cecily is “Mr. Worthing’s ward.” She notes that Ernest has never mentioned having a ward, and Cecily explains that it is not Ernest Worthing who is her guardian but his brother Jack and, in fact, that she is engaged to be married to Ernest Worthing. Gwendolen points out that this is impossible as she herself is engaged to Ernest Worthing. The tea party degenerates into a war of manners.
Jack and Algernon arrive toward the climax of this confrontation, each having separately made arrangements with Dr. Chasuble to be christened Ernest later that day. Each of the young ladies points out that the other has been deceived: Cecily informs Gwendolen that her fiancé is really named Jack and Gwendolen informs Cecily that hers is really called Algernon. The two women demand to know where Jack’s brother Ernest is, since both of them are engaged to be married to him. Jack is forced to admit that he has no brother and that Ernest is a complete fiction. Both women are shocked and furious, and they retire to the house arm in arm.
Act 3 takes place in the drawing room of the Manor House, where Cecily and Gwendolen have retired. When Jack and Algernon enter from the garden, the two women confront them. Cecily asks Algernon why he pretended to be her guardian’s brother. Algernon tells her he did it in order to meet her. Gwendolen asks Jack whether he pretended to have a brother in order to come into London to see her as often as possible, and she interprets his evasive reply as an affirmation. The women are somewhat appeased but still concerned over the issue of the name. However, when Jack and Algernon tell Gwendolen and Cecily that they have both made arrangements to be christened Ernest that afternoon, all is forgiven and the two pairs of lovers embrace. At this moment, Lady Bracknell’s arrival is announced.
Lady Bracknell has followed Gwendolen from London, having bribed Gwendolen’s maid to reveal her destination. She demands to know what is going on. Gwendolen again informs Lady Bracknell of her engagement to Jack, and Lady Bracknell reiterates that a union between them is out of the question. Algernon tells Lady Bracknell of his engagement to Cecily, prompting her to inspect Cecily and inquire into her social connections, which she does in a routine and patronizing manner that infuriates Jack. He replies to all her questions with a mixture of civility and sarcasm, withholding until the last possible moment the information that Cecily is actually worth a great deal of money and stands to inherit still more when she comes of age. At this, Lady Bracknell becomes genuinely interested.
Jack informs Lady Bracknell that, as Cecily’s legal guardian, he refuses to give his consent to her union with Algernon. Lady Bracknell suggests that the two young people simply wait until Cecily comes of age, and Jack points out that under the terms of her grandfather’s will, Cecily does not legally come of age until she is thirty-five. Lady Bracknell asks Jack to reconsider, and he points out that the matter is entirely in her own hands. As soon as she consents to his marriage to Gwendolen, Cecily can have his consent to marry Algernon. However, Lady Bracknell refuses to entertain the notion. She and Gwendolen are on the point of leaving when Dr. Chasuble arrives and happens to mention Cecily’s governess, Miss Prism. At this, Lady Bracknell starts and asks that Miss Prism be sent for.
When the governess arrives and catches sight of Lady Bracknell, she begins to look guilty and furtive. Lady Bracknell accuses her of having left her sister’s house twenty-eight years before with a baby and never returned. She demands to know where the baby is. Miss Prism confesses she doesn’t know, explaining that she lost the baby, having absentmindedly placed it in a handbag in which she had meant to place the manuscript for a novel she had written. Jack asks what happened to the bag, and Miss Prism says she left it in the cloakroom of a railway station. Jack presses her for further details and goes racing offstage, returning a few moments later with a large handbag. When Miss Prism confirms that the bag is hers, Jack throws himself on her with a cry of “Mother!” It takes a while before the situation is sorted out, but before too long we understand that Jack is not the illegitimate child of Miss Prism but the legitimate child of Lady Bracknell’s sister and, therefore, Algernon’s older brother. Furthermore, Jack had been originally christened “Ernest John.” All these years Jack has unwittingly been telling the truth: Ernest is his name, as is Jack, and he does have an unprincipled younger brother—Algernon. Again the couples embrace, Miss Prism and Dr. Chasuble follow suit, and Jack acknowledges that he now understands “the vital Importance of Being Earnest.”"
Personal,"Anne’s diary begins on her thirteenth birthday, June 12, 1942, and ends shortly after her fifteenth. At the start of her diary, Anne describes fairly typical girlhood experiences, writing about her friendships with other girls, her crushes on boys, and her academic performance at school. Because anti-Semitic laws forced Jews into separate schools, Anne and her older sister, Margot, attended the Jewish Lyceum in Amsterdam.
	The Franks had moved to the Netherlands in the years leading up to World War II to escape persecution in Germany. After the Germans invaded the Netherlands in 1940, the Franks were forced into hiding. With another family, the van Daans, and an acquaintance, Mr. Dussel, they moved into a small secret annex above Otto Frank’s office where they had stockpiled food and supplies. The employees from Otto’s firm helped hide the Franks and kept them supplied with food, medicine, and information about the outside world.
	The residents of the annex pay close attention to every development of the war by listening to the radio. Some bits of news catch Anne’s attention and make their way into her diary, providing a vivid historical context for her personal thoughts. The adults make optimistic bets about when the war will end, and their mood is severely affected by Allied setbacks or German advances. Amsterdam is devastated by the war during the two years the Franks are in hiding. All of the city’s residents suffer, since food becomes scarce and robberies more frequent.
	Anne often writes about her feelings of isolation and loneliness. She has a tumultuous relationship with the adults in the annex, particularly her mother, whom she considers lacking in love and affection. She adores her father, but she is frequently scolded and criticized by Mr. and Mrs. van Daan and Mr. Dussel. Anne thinks that her sister, Margot, is smart, pretty, and agreeable, but she does not feel close to her and does not write much about her. Anne eventually develops a close friendship with Peter van Daan, the teenage boy in the annex. Mr. Frank does not approve, however, and the intensity of Anne’s infatuation begins to lessen.
	Anne matures considerably throughout the course of her diary entries, moving from detailed accounts of basic activities to deeper, more profound thoughts about humanity and her own personal nature. She finds it difficult to understand why the Jews are being singled out and persecuted. Anne also confronts her own identity. Though she considers herself to be German, her German citizenship has been revoked, and though she calls Holland her home, many of the Dutch have turned against the Jews. Anne feels a tremendous solidarity with her aggrieved people, and yet at the same time she wants to be seen as an individual rather than a member of a persecuted group.
During the two years recorded in her diary, Anne deals with confinement and deprivation, as well as the complicated and difficult issues of growing up in the brutal circumstances of the Holocaust. Her diary describes a struggle to define herself within this climate of oppression. Anne’s diary ends without comment on August 1, 1944, the end of a seemingly normal day that leaves us with the expectation of seeing another entry on the next page. However, the Frank family is betrayed to the Nazis and arrested on August 4, 1944. Anne’s diary, the observations of an imaginative, friendly, sometimes petty, and rather normal teenage girl, comes to an abrupt and silent end. 
Otto Frank is the family’s sole survivor, and he recovers Anne’s diary from Miep. He decides to fulfill Anne’s wishes by publishing the diary. Anne’s diary becomes a condemnation of the unimaginable horror of the Holocaust, and one of the few accounts that describe it from a young person’s perspective.
	Since Anne’s diary is a true personal account of a life in hiding, it is inappropriate to analyze it as a novel or other work of fiction. Parts of the diary were intended for public view, but others clearly were not. To appreciate and interpret the diary, it is necessary to consider its horrible context, World War II and the Holocaust, before any discussion of plot development or thematic content."
Dr,"Doctor Faustus, a well-respected German scholar, grows dissatisfied with the limits of traditional forms of knowledge—logic, medicine, law, and religion—and decides that he wants to learn to practice magic. His friends Valdes and Cornelius instruct him in the black arts, and he begins his new career as a magician by summoning up Mephastophilis, a devil. Despite Mephastophilis’s warnings about the horrors of hell, Faustus tells the devil to return to his master, Lucifer, with an offer of Faustus’s soul in exchange for twenty-four years of service from Mephastophilis. Meanwhile, Wagner, Faustus’s servant, has picked up some magical ability and uses it to press a clown named Robin into his service.
Mephastophilis returns to Faustus with word that Lucifer has accepted Faustus’s offer. Faustus experiences some misgivings and wonders if he should repent and save his soul; in the end, though, he agrees to the deal, signing it with his blood. As soon as he does so, the words “Homo fuge,” Latin for “O man, fly,” appear branded on his arm. Faustus again has second thoughts, but Mephastophilis bestows rich gifts on him and gives him a book of spells to learn. Later, Mephastophilis answers all of his questions about the nature of the world, refusing to answer only when Faustus asks him who made the universe. This refusal prompts yet another bout of misgivings in Faustus, but Mephastophilis and Lucifer bring in personifications of the Seven Deadly Sins to prance about in front of Faustus, and he is impressed enough to quiet his doubts.
Armed with his new powers and attended by Mephastophilis, Faustus begins to travel. He goes to the pope’s court in Rome, makes himself invisible, and plays a series of tricks. He disrupts the pope’s banquet by stealing food and boxing the pope’s ears. Following this incident, he travels through the courts of Europe, with his fame spreading as he goes. Eventually, he is invited to the court of the German emperor, Charles V (the enemy of the pope), who asks Faustus to allow him to see Alexander the Great, the famed fourth-century BCE Macedonian king and conqueror. Faustus conjures up an image of Alexander, and Charles is suitably impressed. A knight scoffs at Faustus’s powers, and Faustus chastises him by making antlers sprout from his head. Furious, the knight vows revenge.
Meanwhile, Robin, Wagner’s clown, has picked up some magic on his own, and with his fellow stablehand, Rafe, he undergoes a number of comic misadventures. At one point, he manages to summon Mephastophilis, who threatens to turn Robin and Rafe into animals (or perhaps even does transform them; the text isn’t clear) to punish them for their foolishness.
Faustus then goes on with his travels, playing a trick on a horse-courser along the way. Faustus sells him a horse that turns into a heap of straw when ridden into a river. Eventually, Faustus is invited to the court of the Duke of Vanholt, where he performs various feats. The horse-courser shows up there, along with Robin, a man named Dick (Rafe in the A text), and various others who have fallen victim to Faustus’s trickery. But Faustus casts spells on them and sends them on their way, to the amusement of the duke and duchess.
As the twenty-four years of his deal with Lucifer come to a close, Faustus begins to dread his impending death. He has Mephastophilis call up Helen of Troy, the famous beauty from the ancient world, and uses her presence to impress a group of scholars. An old man urges Faustus to repent, but Faustus drives him away. Faustus summons Helen again and exclaims rapturously about her beauty. But time is growing short. Faustus tells the scholars about his pact, and they are horror-stricken and resolve to pray for him. On the final night before the expiration of the twenty-four years, Faustus is overcome by fear and remorse. He begs for mercy, but it is too late. At midnight, a host of devils appears and carries his soul off to hell. In the morning, the scholars find Faustus’s limbs and decide to hold a funeral for him."
Implicated,"Educated is primarily retrospective, consisting of Tara Westover's memories about her past. She tells the story of the events of her life from a vantage point in her late twenties, occasionally interjecting to comment on the process of trying to arrive at an accurate version of the past. Tara was born the youngest of seven children to parents whom she refers to as Faye and Gene (pseudonyms). The Westover family lived on a farm in rural Idaho, where Gene made a living salvaging scrap metal while Faye worked as an unlicensed midwife and herbal healer. Gene suffered from paranoid fears about interference from the federal government, and as a result he refused to allow his children to attend school, receive birth certificates, or receive medical attention. Gene was also a devout Mormon who believed in radical self-sufficiency and an impending Day of Judgement.
		
Shifts in the Westover family dynamic began to emerge when Tara was about nine. Her mother's work as a midwife increased her sense of independence, but after sustaining a serious and untreated brain injury in a car accident, Faye began to lose confidence in her skills, and focused instead on using herbal remedies and a form of intuitive healing. Around this time, Tyler (the third son) announced that he was going to attend college, which estranged him from his family. Tyler's absence forced Tara to become more involved in helping her father with his scrapping work, which left her constantly exposed to the possibility of dangerous injury. It also made her more curious about possibly pursuing an education herself. When Tara was ten, she told her disapproving father that she wanted to begin going to school, but nothing came of the idea.
As Tara grew into her teens, she acquired more independence from her family due to taking on various jobs and pursuing singing and musical theatre in the local community. However, her life was dominated by the strict rules and religious doctrine her father imposed, and Tara often worried about becoming sinful. When Tara was thirteen, her older brother Shawn moved back home. At first Shawn and Tara were close and spent a lot of time together. When Tara was about fifteen, however, Shawn began to be physically abusive toward her. His behavior only got worse after Shawn experienced a head injury. Tyler eventually realized that Shawn was hurting Tara, and he urged Tara to seriously consider applying to college and getting away from the family. Although she was uncertain at first, Tara began to study and was eventually accepted at Brigham Young University, having passed herself off as homeschooled.
In January 2004, when Tara was seventeen years old, she moved to Utah to begin her college education. She found the adjustment very difficult at first, but eventually began to excel in her studies. Tara's finances were precarious, and she had to hold multiple jobs and maintain very high grades to retain her scholarship. Her emerging independence also caused a threatening dynamic between her, Gene, and Shawn. Whenever Tara returned to Buck's Peak, her father manipulated her into working for him, while Shawn continued to physically and emotionally abuse her. Tara eventually confided to a bishop about her life, and he helped her to secure funding to finance her education. Tara's studies, and the people she met, also gradually opened her eyes to different realities and force her to realize how damaging and isolating her childhood has been. Tara eventually changed her major to studying history, and is encouraged to apply for a study abroad program at Cambridge University in England.
Tara's experience at Cambridge broadened her horizons even further, and she was encouraged to consider graduate studies. Tara still felt isolated from her peers, and ashamed of her origins. She hid most of her past even from her friends and the men she occasionally dated. She was eventually awarded a prestigious Cambridge Gates Fellowship and moved to England to pursue a Master's degree. She remained in close contact with her family and returned to Idaho regularly to visit, but her relationship with them deteriorated. Shawn was growing increasingly erratic and violent, and Tara feared for the safety of his wife and young child. By chance, she revealed to her sister Audrey that Shawn had been abusive with her, and Audrey later confided that Shawn abused her as well. Audrey blamed herself for not protecting her younger sister, and suggested that she and Tara confront their parents and Shawn about what happened to them.
By then Tara had built a happy life for herself in England, and was working on a PhD in history at Cambridge. However, the attempt to speak the truth quickly became a source of conflict in the family. Tara became more and more ostracized within her family, eventually culminating in Shawn learning that she had been telling their parents about the abuse she suffered. Realizing her family would never trust her claims, Tara became estranged from most of them, with the exception of Tyler.  The estrangement from her family prompted grief and depression for Tara, but she was finally able to heal, and successfully completed her PhD. By the end of her memoir, Tara has accepted that she may never have a relationship with her family again, but she takes pride in the independence she has established, and the life she has built for herself."
Survived,"Primo Levi’s memoir depicts life and death in the final days of the Auschwitz concentration camp complex from his incarceration in February 1944 to the Soviet liberation of the camp in January 1945. At the time of Levi’s arrest as a Jew under the Italian Racial Laws, World War II had been in progress since September 1939. The Nazis’ forced labor camps filled the gaps in their dwindling workforce on the home front to continue the war effort.
Levi is one of 650 Italians deported to Auschwitz as part of that labor force. Once in Poland, the train stops on a deserted plain and the young and fit are separated from the children, the old, and the sick. A total of ninety-six men and twenty-nine women board trucks bound for the respective camps of Monowitz-Buna and Birkenau in the Auschwitz complex, and the other 500 are killed. Intake at the Monowitz-Buna camp involves the seizure of all their belongings, the shaving of their heads, and the tattooing of identification numbers on their arms. Prisoners are assigned to blocks where pairs share narrow bunks. The daily routine is enforced by a cacophony of shouting in a variety of languages as well as beatings. Each man is assigned to a work squad. Some work sites are located kilometers away from the barracks where private corporations maintain plants to utilize the slave labor. The prisoners walk to these sites in their prison-issue cotton shirts, jackets, and wooden clogs in below-freezing weather. Hunger is constant, to the point that the men dream of food and make eating movements in their sleep.
When Levi has a job injury, he spends a few weeks in the Ka-Be infirmary. There he learns of the process of selection to send those no longer able to work to the gas chambers in Birkenau. He finds out that Ka-Be is the center of an extensive barter system. All personal belongings of those admitted are confiscated for later use to barter for medical supplies, which are stolen from the private corporation worksites by prisoners looking to improve their quality of life. Levi analyzes the complex political and economic system in the camp alongside the dynamic of the antipathy existing between the German political soldiers of the Nazi Party (SS) and the industrialists. At the center of the book, he lays out the personal qualities and strategies that improve a prisoner’s chances of survival. The book will go on to present lessons in working the system.
Levi’s own turning point comes with an appointment to the Chemical Kommando, a squad of chemists tasked with supporting the Buna synthetic rubber plant. He develops friendships and continues to upgrade his survival skills. An influx of Hungarian internees in the spring creates overcrowding conditions. In June and July, the inmates feel fleeting hope hearing news of developments in the war: the Allies’ landing in Normandy; the Russian offensive; and a failed attempt to assassinate Hitler. In August, the Allies begin bombing the area of Poland where Auschwitz is situated and continue throughout the fall. The bombardments halt work on the Buna rubber plant. In October, the German SS commandant conducts a selection to deal with overcrowded conditions in the blocks. This involves sorting the thousands of prisoners in the camp into two categories: those who are sent to die in the gas chambers at Birkenau, and those who are spared. Levi and his best friend, Alberto, are spared.
A group of subversive prisoners blow up a crematorium in Birkenau. In November, Levi is chosen as one of three prisoner chemists to work in the Buna laboratory as the Germans gear up once again to begin production of the rubber. Civilian prisoners have brought scarlet fever, diphtheria, and typhus into the camp population. Toward the end of December, the German SS holds a public hanging for the one prisoner who hasn’t already been executed for the crematorium destruction. Levi feels ashamed because, despite he and Alberto’s organized schemes to collect large amounts of food and clothing, they have still let the Germans defeat their spirits.
On January 11, Levi comes down with scarlet fever and is admitted to the infectious disease ward of the Ka-Be infirmary with twelve other patients in various stages of scarlet fever, diphtheria, and typhus. With the Soviet troops advancing, the Germans evacuate Auschwitz early on January 18, taking the fit and leaving the sick behind. Alberto leaves with the healthy prisoners, never to be seen by Levi again. Bombardments begin that day, destroying parts of the complex around the infirmary. From January 18 through 20, the prisoners watch the Wehrmacht fleeing the oncoming Soviet army. The Soviet army enters the camp on January 27 and sets up a temporary hospital to care for the survivors. Levi ends his memoir with an epitaph for the men who shared the last ten days as a team of survivors."
Pay,"A Raisin in the Sun portrays a few weeks in the life of the Youngers, a Black family living on the South Side of Chicago in the 1950s. When the play opens, the Youngers are about to receive an insurance check for $10,000. This money comes from the deceased Mr. Younger’s life insurance policy. Each of the adult members of the family has an idea as to what he or she would like to do with this money. The matriarch of the family, Mama, wants to buy a house to fulfill a dream she shared with her husband. Mama’s son, Walter Lee, would rather use the money to invest in a liquor store with his friends. He believes that the investment will solve the family’s financial problems forever. Walter’s wife, Ruth, agrees with Mama, however, and hopes that she and Walter can provide more space and opportunity for their son, Travis. Finally, Beneatha, Walter’s sister and Mama’s daughter, wants to use the money for her medical school tuition. She also wishes that her family members were not so interested in assimilating into the white world. Beneatha instead tries to find her identity by looking back to the past and to Africa.
As the play progresses, the Youngers clash over their competing dreams. Ruth discovers that she is pregnant but fears that if she has the child, she will put more financial pressure on her family members. When Walter says nothing to Ruth’s admission that she is considering abortion, Mama puts a down payment on a house for the whole family. She believes that a bigger, brighter dwelling will help them all. This house is in Clybourne Park, an entirely white neighborhood. When the Youngers’ future neighbors find out that the Youngers are moving in, they send Mr. Lindner, from the Clybourne Park Improvement Association, to offer the Youngers money in return for staying away. The Youngers refuse the deal, even after Walter loses the rest of the money ($6,500) to his friend Willy Harris, who persuades Walter to invest in the liquor store and then runs off with his cash.
In the meantime, Beneatha rejects her suitor, George Murchison, whom she believes to be shallow and blind to the problems of race. Subsequently, she receives a marriage proposal from her Nigerian boyfriend, Joseph Asagai, who wants Beneatha to get a medical degree and move to Africa with him (Beneatha does not make her choice before the end of the play). The Youngers eventually move out of the apartment, fulfilling the family’s long-held dream. Their future seems uncertain and slightly dangerous, but they are optimistic and determined to live a better life. They believe that they can succeed if they stick together as a family and resolve to defer their dreams no longer."
March,"Rashad and Quinn are both students at Springfield Central High School. They have some friends in common but have never interacted with each other. Rashad is Black, and his father has told him throughout his life about the importance of discipline for young Black men. Rashad’s father joined the army and then the police force before retiring and often tells Rashad that the army is the best opportunity for a Black man to succeed in the United States. Because of this, Rashad is part of the Reserve Officer Training Corps, or ROTC. However, Rashad would rather spend his time drawing and hanging out with his friends English, Shannon, and Carlos. 
Quinn is white, and his father died in Afghanistan. Quinn lives with his mother and his younger brother, Willy, and resents that people expect him to live up to the memory of his father. Quinn’s best friends are Dwyer and Guzzo, who lives across the street. Guzzo’s brother, Paul Galluzzo, is a police officer and has acted as a father figure to Quinn ever since Quinn’s father died. Quinn, Dwyer, and Guzzo are on the basketball team together, along with English.
One Friday, Rashad and Quinn are each planning on going to a party with their friends at Guzzo and Paul’s cousin Jill’s house. Quinn has a crush on Jill. On the way to the party, Rashad stops at Jerry’s Corner Mart to pick up some chips and gum. Jerry’s is always monitored by a police officer as a response to shoplifting incidents at the store. While Rashad is picking out chips, he goes to text his brother, Spoony. His phone is in his bag, so he puts it on the floor and kneels down to take the phone out. While he is kneeling, a woman who was standing behind him backs up and trips over him, causing them both to fall over and Rashad’s chips to slide up the aisle. 
The police officer on duty comes over and asks what happened but assumes Rashad was trying to steal before Rashad or the woman can explain. The police officer drags Rashad outside, handcuffs him, throws him to the ground, and begins beating him. Meanwhile, Quinn and his friends have been waiting in the alley next to Jerry’s to ask an adult to buy them beer that they can take to the party. When Quinn goes around to the front of Jerry’s, he sees what the police officer is doing to Rashad. He recognizes the police officer as Paul Galluzzo. He tells his friends to run and, when they are far enough away, explains what happened and tells Guzzo that he saw his brother. The three decide to go to the party and try to forget about it.
Over the weekend, Rashad wakes up in the hospital with a broken nose and ribs and is told he needs to stay there so the doctors can monitor his internal bleeding. Rashad’s father questions whether Rashad was presenting himself in a way that made him seem dangerous, while Spoony is outraged at the situation. The local news obtains footage of Paul beating Rashad and begins covering the story. The Galluzzo family decides to have a cookout on Sunday, which Quinn and Jill both find strange. Quinn and Jill talk at the cookout about what Paul did to Rashad, while Paul and Guzzo try to intimidate Quinn into not saying anything about what he saw.
At school that week, everyone is talking about what happened to Rashad. Quinn feels conflicted as he has only ever seen the good side of Paul and doesn’t know Rashad. On Tuesday, someone has painted graffiti on the sidewalk in front of the school that says, “Rashad is absent again today.” This message creates a division in the school between those who believe Rashad was innocent and those who believe Paul was just doing his job. When Rashad sees a picture of the graffiti, he knows it is Carlos’s work. 
Spoony and his girlfriend, Berry, plan a protest that coming Friday against the police department. Guzzo continues to question Quinn’s loyalty. At first, Quinn wants to believe that Paul was just trying to do his job, but he just can’t forget what he saw outside Jerry’s. On Thursday, Quinn wears a shirt to school that says, “I’m marching. Are you?” The coach of the basketball team tells the players not to go to the protest and tells Quinn he will call his mother to tell her about his shirt. Quinn’s mother confronts him about the protest, and Quinn says he is standing up for what he believes in, just as his father would have done.
The doctor releases Rashad from the hospital on Thursday, and Rashad plans on joining the protest the following day. On Friday morning, Rashad and Quinn both feel nervous about the protest. Quinn sees a tank-like police vehicle headed toward the school and worries about the protesters’ safety. However, after talking with Jill, he understands that Black people live in fear of police violence every day and that they should put themselves at risk for one day to speak out against this reality. Rashad and Quinn, along with an enormous crowd, march from Jerry’s Corner Mart to the police department, where they stage a die-in as Berry reads aloud the names of unarmed Black people killed by police officers. Rashad and Quinn notice each other during the die-in and feel a connection as they both think of the people on the list and how they will keep fighting for them."
Ravaged,"Euripedes' Medea opens in a state of conflict. Jason has abandoned his wife, Medea, along with their two children. He hopes to advance his station by remarrying with Glauce, the daughter of Creon, king of Corinth, the Greek city where the play is set. All the events of play proceed out of this initial dilemma, and the involved parties become its central characters.
Outside the royal palace, a nurse laments the events that have lead to the present crisis. After a long series of trials and adventures, which ultimately forced Jason and Medea to seek exile in Corinth, the pair had settled down and established their family, achieving a degree of fame and respectability. Jason's recent abandonment of that family has crushed Medea emotionally, to the degree that she curses her own existence, as well as that of her two children.
Fearing a possible plot of revenge, Creon banishes Medea and her children from the city. After pleading for mercy, Medea is granted one day before she must leave, during which she plans to complete her quest for ""justice""--at this stage in her thinking, the murder of Creon, Glauce, and Jason. Jason accuses Medea of overreacting. By voicing her grievances so publicly, she has endangered her life and that of their children. He claims that his decision to remarry was in everyone's best interest. Medea finds him spineless, and she refuses to accept his token offers of help.
Appearing by chance in Corinth, Aegeus, King of Athens, offers Medea sanctuary in his home city in exchange for her knowledge of certain drugs that can cure his sterility. Now guaranteed an eventual haven in Athens, Medea has cleared all obstacles to completing her revenge, a plan which grows to include the murder of her own children; the pain their loss will cause her does not outweigh the satisfaction she will feel in making Jason suffer.
For the balance of the play, Medea engages in a ruse; she pretends to sympathize with Jason (bringing him into her confidence) and offers his wife ""gifts,"" a coronet and dress. Ostensibly, the gifts are meant to convince Glauce to ask her father to allow the children to stay in Corinth. The coronet and dress are actually poisoned, however, and their delivery causes Glauce's death. Seeing his daughter ravaged by the poison, Creon chooses to die by her side by dramatically embracing her and absorbing the poison himself.
A messenger recounts the gruesome details of these deaths, which Medea absorbs with cool attentiveness. Her earlier state of anxiety, which intensified as she struggled with the decision to commit infanticide, has now given way to an assured determination to fulfill her plans. Against the protests of the chorus, Medea murders her children and flees the scene in a dragon-pulled chariot provided by her grandfather, the Sun-God. Jason is left cursing his lot; his hope of advancing his station by abandoning Medea and marrying Glauce, the conflict which opened the play, has been annihilated, and everything he values has been lost through the deaths that conclude the tragedy."
Farmers,"Old Major, a prize-winning boar, gathers the animals of the Manor Farm for a meeting in the big barn. He tells them of a dream he has had in which all animals live together with no human beings to oppress or control them. He tells the animals that they must work toward such a paradise and teaches them a song called “Beasts of England,” in which his dream vision is lyrically described. The animals greet Major’s vision with great enthusiasm. When he dies only three nights after the meeting, three younger pigs—Snowball, Napoleon, and Squealer—formulate his main principles into a philosophy called Animalism. Late one night, the animals manage to defeat the farmer Mr. Jones in a battle, running him off the land. They rename the property Animal Farm and dedicate themselves to achieving Major’s dream. The cart-horse Boxer devotes himself to the cause with particular zeal, committing his great strength to the prosperity of the farm and adopting as a personal maxim the affirmation “I will work harder.”
At first, Animal Farm prospers. Snowball works at teaching the animals to read, and Napoleon takes a group of young puppies to educate them in the principles of Animalism. When Mr. Jones reappears to take back his farm, the animals defeat him again, in what comes to be known as the Battle of the Cowshed, and take the farmer’s abandoned gun as a token of their victory. As time passes, however, Napoleon and Snowball increasingly quibble over the future of the farm, and they begin to struggle with each other for power and influence among the other animals. Snowball concocts a scheme to build an electricity-generating windmill, but Napoleon solidly opposes the plan. At the meeting to vote on whether to take up the project, Snowball gives a passionate speech. Although Napoleon gives only a brief retort, he then makes a strange noise, and nine attack dogs—the puppies that Napoleon had confiscated in order to “educate”—burst into the barn and chase Snowball from the farm. Napoleon assumes leadership of Animal Farm and declares that there will be no more meetings. From that point on, he asserts, the pigs alone will make all of the decisions—for the good of every animal.
Napoleon now quickly changes his mind about the windmill, and the animals, especially Boxer, devote their efforts to completing it. One day, after a storm, the animals find the windmill toppled. The human farmers in the area declare smugly that the animals made the walls too thin, but Napoleon claims that Snowball returned to the farm to sabotage the windmill. He stages a great purge, during which various animals who have allegedly participated in Snowball’s great conspiracy—meaning any animal who opposes Napoleon’s uncontested leadership—meet instant death at the teeth of the attack dogs. With his leadership unquestioned (Boxer has taken up a second maxim, “Napoleon is always right”), Napoleon begins expanding his powers, rewriting history to make Snowball a villain. Napoleon also begins to act more and more like a human being—sleeping in a bed, drinking whisky, and engaging in trade with neighboring farmers. The original Animalist principles strictly forbade such activities, but Squealer, Napoleon’s propagandist, justifies every action to the other animals, convincing them that Napoleon is a great leader and is making things better for everyone—despite the fact that the common animals are cold, hungry, and overworked.
Mr. Frederick, a neighboring farmer, cheats Napoleon in the purchase of some timber and then attacks the farm and dynamites the windmill, which had been rebuilt at great expense. After the demolition of the windmill, a pitched battle ensues, during which Boxer receives major wounds. The animals rout the farmers, but Boxer’s injuries weaken him. When he later falls while working on the windmill, he senses that his time has nearly come. One day, Boxer is nowhere to be found. According to Squealer, Boxer has died in peace after having been taken to the hospital, praising the Rebellion with his last breath. In actuality, Napoleon has sold his most loyal and long-suffering worker to a glue maker in order to get money for whisky.
Years pass on Animal Farm, and the pigs become more and more like human beings—walking upright, carrying whips, and wearing clothes. Eventually, the seven principles of Animalism, known as the Seven Commandments and inscribed on the side of the barn, become reduced to a single principle reading “all animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.” Napoleon entertains a human farmer named Mr. Pilkington at a dinner and declares his intent to ally himself with the human farmers against the laboring classes of both the human and animal communities. He also changes the name of Animal Farm back to the Manor Farm, claiming that this title is the “correct” one. Looking in at the party of elites through the farmhouse window, the common animals can no longer tell which are the pigs and which are the human beings."
Lynchings,"A Gathering of Old Men takes place on the Marshall Plantation in Bayonne Louisiana. The plantation's Cajun work boss, Beau Baton, has been murdered just before the novel begins. Candy Marshall, the partial owner and general overseer of the plantation, discovers Beau's dead body outside of Mathu's house. Candy believes that Mathu killed Beau, but as Mathu is virtually her foster father she wants to make every effort to protect him. Candy immediately gathers everyone in the plantation to Mathu's house. When Miss Merle, the mistress of a local plantation arrives, Candy promptly confesses to the murder. Miss Merle does not believe her, but agrees to help. Candy decides that the best course of action would be to bring all the local men to Mathu's house with as many twelve gauge shotguns and empty shells as possible. With numerous men and guns at the crime scene, Candy believes that the local Sheriff will not be able to solve the crime. Miss Merle spreads Candy's plan through the community. Within a few hours, eighteen men have gathered at Mathu's house. All of these men are in their seventies and their eighties, but they have all brought their shotguns and are ready to confess.
In addition to the arrival of the Sheriff, most people at the plantation await the arrival of local Cajun named Fix. Historically, Fix led many lynch mobs against the local blacks. Everyone at the plantation believes that he will soon arrive once again to seek revenge, especially since the murdered man, Beau, is his son. Before anything else happens though, two other men arrive: Lou Dimes, Candy's boyfriend, and Sheriff Mapes. After the Sheriff sees Beau's dead body, he instructs his deputy to find Fix and keep him off the plantation as to avoid a lynching. Candy promptly tells the Sheriff that she committed the murder, but he does not believe her. The Sheriff eyes the old men and decides to question them about the crime.
The first two men that the Sheriff Mapes questions, Billy Washington and Gable, both confess to the murder. When their answers displease him, the Sheriff strikes them each twice. Next, the Sheriff queries the Reverend Jameson to find out what is happening. When the Reverend tells him nothing, the Sheriff punches him so forcibly that the Reverend falls to the ground. The watching men respond by all physically lining up so that the Sheriff can easily hit them all. Their willingness to confess and their indifference to being struck startle the Sheriff. He stops his questioning and thinks about the murder. The Sheriff knows that Charlie, who is not present, works most closely with Beau, but believes that Charlie is too weak to have committed the act. The Sheriff decides that the only culprit could be Mathu because Mathu is the only black man who has ever demonstrated the strength to stand up to local whites. For the Sheriff, Mathu is the only man who is man enough to murder.
Although the Sheriff has a suspect, he cannot arrest anyone because everyone confesses. As the afternoon goes on, many other black men confess to Beau's murder. They explain that they killed Beau because of what they have suffered— a sister raped; a son executed for crime he did not commit; and a brother killed for beating a tractor in a race. Beau died, they explain, for their past sufferings. The Sheriff still believes that Mathu murdered Beau, but can do nothing so everyone just waits to see if Fix Bauton and a lynch mob will show up.
Beau Bauton's brother, Gil, is a star football player on the Louisiana State University team who plays closely with a black halfback named Cal. The two players rely upon one another for their success. Due to their racial combination the press has dubbed them ""Salt and Pepper."" When Gil learns of his brother's murder, he treats Cal coldly. He visits the Marshall Plantation where he sees the gathering of old black men with guns. This sight, and Candy's immediate confession, combined with his brother's death grieves him greatly. Eventually, Gil makes it to home to where his father, Fix Bauton, and others are waiting. Fix, old family friends, and some local racist whites want to revenge Beau's death. Gil begs his father to let justice take its course and argues that the days of lynching are over. Gil refuses to assist his family in violence, citing his desire become an All-American football player. Luke Will, a local ruffian, criticizes Gil's perspective, and so too does Gil's father. Still, Fix will not revenge Beau's death without all of his sons. Without Gil, Fix decides to stay home. Luke Will, on the other hand, is up for the job and gathers some men to help him. They stop first at a local bar to drink some whisky in order to be prepared for the lynching.
Back at the plantation, Sheriff Mapes has found out that Fix is not coming. Mathu peacefully agrees to go to jail. Before they leave however, Charlie returns. Charlie confesses that he killed Beau after Beau threatened him. Charlie then asked Mathu to take the blame and fled. Charlie has spent the day hiding in the swamps, but felt called back to confess and show that he is truly a man.
Before Sheriff Mapes can take Charlie in, Luke Will and his crew arrive. They demand that Mapes hand Charlie over. When Mapes refuses, Luke Will shoots Mapes in the arm. The old black men grab live shotgun shells that they have been hiding in their pockets and start shooting at the whites. Sheriff Mapes remains fallen and injured in Mathu's front yard. The shooting surprises the whites and one of them, Leroy, is lightly injured. As the battle continues, Charlie and Luke Will become the primary fighters, dead set on eliminating the other. Eventually, Charlie rises from his hiding spot and manages to shoot Luke Will before he himself is shot to death. Everyone in the community pays homage to Charlie's dead body.
A trial for all blacks and whites involved in the shooting takes place a week after the event. The judge places everyone on probation for five years. At the trial's end, Mathu disappears with the other black men in a car, while Candy lingers on the courthouse steps with Lou. She grips his hand tightly as the novel closes in a gesture that reaffirms her commitment to their relationship."
Views,"Lucy Honeychurch, a young upper middle class woman, visits Italy under the charge of her older cousin Charlotte. At their pension, or guesthouse, in Florence, they are given rooms that look into the courtyard rather than out over the river Arno. Mr. Emerson, a fellow guest, generously offers them the rooms belonging to himself and his son George. Although Charlotte is offended by Mr. Emerson's lack of tact and propriety, she finally does agree to the switch. Lucy is an avid young pianist. Mr. Beebe, watches her passionate playing and predicts that someday she will live her life with as much gusto as she plays the piano.
Lucy's visit to Italy is marked by several significant encounters with the Emersons. In Santa Croce church, George complains that his father means well, but always offends everyone. Mr. Emerson tells Lucy that his son needs her in order to overcome his youthful melancholy. Later, Lucy is walking in the Piazza Signoria, feeling dull, when she comes in close contact with two quarreling Italian men. One man stabs the other, and she faints, to be rescued by George. On their return trip home, he kisses her, much to her surprise. She keeps his rash behavior a secret.
On a country outing in the hills, Lucy wanders in search of Mr. Beebe and the supercilious chaplain, Mr. Eager. However, the Italian cab driver leads her instead to George, who is standing on a terrace covered with blue violets. George sees her and again kisses her, but this time Charlotte sees him and chastises him after they have resurnedreturned to the pension. She leaves with Lucy for Rome the next day.
The second half of the book centers on Lucy's home in Surrey, where she lives with her mother, Mrs. Honeychurch, and her brother, Freddy. A man she met in Rome, the snobbish Cecil Vyse, proposes marriage to her for the third time, and she accepts him. He disapproves of her family and the country people she knows, finding them coarse and unsophisticated. There is a small, ugly villa available for rent in the town, and as a joke, Cecil offers it to the Emersons, whom he meets by chance in a museum. They take him up on the offer and move in, much to Lucy's initial horror.
George plays tennis with the Honeychurches on a Sunday when Cecil is at his most intolerable. After the game, Cecil reads from a book by Miss Lavish, a woman who also stayed with Lucy and Charlotte at the pension in Florence. The novel records a kiss among violets, and Lucy realizes that Charlotte let the secret out. In a moment alone, George kisses her again. Lucy tells him to leave, but George insists that Cecil is not the right man for her, characterizing Cecil as controlling and appreciative of things rather than people. Lucy sees Cecil in a new light, and breaks off her engagement that night.
However, Lucy will not believe that she loves George; she wants to stay unmarried and travel to Greece with some elderly women she met in Italy, the Miss Alans. She meets old Mr. Emerson by chance, who insists that she loves George and should marry him, because it is what her soul truly wants. Lucy realizes he is right, and though she must fly against convention, she marries George, and the book ends with the happy couple staying together in the Florence pension again, in a room with a view.
Analysis
The book depicts Lucy's struggles as she emerges as her own woman, growing from indecision to fulfillment. She struggles between strict, old-fashioned Victorian values and newer, more liberal mores. In this struggle Lucy's own idea of what is true evolves and matures. Her trip to Italy opens her sheltered eyes to ideas and people unlike those she has known growing up in the English countryside. She also notices how freely Italian classes seem to mix, and realizes that the social boundaries she has always regarded as fixed are actually arbitrary. Her experience with the Emersons shows her that there can be beauty in the things that are considered improper, and Charlotte's betrayal shows her that propriety is not always the best judge of what is true.
Having more clearly found herself in Italy, Lucy's real test lies at home, where she must confront her old familiar surroundings. She is still uncertain, however, and confused about what to think about her new experiences. That she missteps and becomes engaged to the pretentious and domineering Cecil shows her susceptibility to the pressures of society. As her bold piano playing suggests, she is cut out for a more daring life, if only she could cut herself away from the restricting social boundaries that engulf her. The Emersons, as free-thinking, modern, truth-loving people, are her deliverers from the grips of society. It is this freedom that allows her to see beyond the dictates of propriety that forbid her marriage to the lower-class George and, therefore, to follow her heart.
George is troubled by existential worries in Italy. He doesn't understand how life can be truly joyful and worthwhile when it is always shadowed by enigma, symbolized by the question mark that he hangs on the wall of his hotel. Lucy, though cautious, is loving by nature and enjoys life even when it challenges her understanding. The two are united by a shared appreciation for beauty, which might be captured in their love of views: Lucy adores the view of the Arno through the pension window, while George's first memory is of himself and his parents gazing at a view. Each possesses what the other needs: George finds simple joys staying with the Honeychurch family, while Lucy finds the courage to recognize her own individuality through her contact with the Emersons.

A Room with a View is one of Forster's early works, and is not as complex as the more mature Howard's End and Passage to India. However, its strength lies in its vivid cast of characters, humorous dialogue, and comedic play upon the manners of the day, and in Forster's engaging, sympathetic exploration of Lucy's character."
Appealing,"Lawyer Bryan Stevenson gives a first-person account of his decades helping marginalized Americans who have been unfairly and harshly punished by the U.S. criminal justice system, which disproportionately targets people of color and poor people. At the heart of Just Mercy is the story of Walter McMillian, a Black man who was framed for the murder of a girl named Ronda Morrison, convicted, and sent to death row. 
Stevenson alternates chapters about Walter with his personal reflections on our country’s history with racial disparity and issues around incarceration. Stevenson highlights other groups of vulnerable people who have been victimized by the criminal justice system and shares the stories of the prisoners he has helped over the years. The book also follows the growth of Stevenson’s nonprofit law project, the Alabama-based Equal Justice Initiative (EJI), through its expansion from focusing on death row prisoners to helping people sentenced to life without parole. Stevenson chronicles how EJI becomes a significant force in criminal justice reform.
In 1983 as a law student, Stevenson discovers his life’s passion when he interns with the Georgia-based Southern Prisoners Defense Committee and meets his first death row prisoner. After graduation Stevenson accepts a job with the organization to represent poor prisoners, including those in Alabama who lack any public defender. He meets Walter McMillian on Alabama’s death row. Walter owns a successful business but also transgresses racial boundaries when he has an affair with a white woman. Soon after the affair becomes public, the woman’s friend, Ralph Myers, accuses Walter of committing the unsolved murder of Ronda Morrison, which has outraged the community. Law enforcement, including a racist sheriff and the district attorney, eagerly pounces on this accusation, overlooking Walter’s alibi and a lack of evidence. Instead, they actively force Ralph to stick with his story even when he tries to recant. They coerce other false witness testimonies, and—as revealed years later—actively suppress evidence.
After Stevenson and the team at EJI unsuccessfully appeal Walter’s conviction, they launch their own investigation of the crime and uncover new evidence. They find witnesses who can prove the witnesses against Walter lied as well as financial records that indicate that one of these witnesses was paid to give false testimony. Stevenson and his team also petition for and receive all records from Walter’s trial. However, their big break comes when they receive a phone call from Ralph, who now wants to make amends. Ralph admits to lying about Walter and says he was threatened by law enforcement. Stevenson wins a hearing for Walter where he can present his new evidence: Ralph’s testimony, which is confirmed by health care workers and other inmates, as well as recordings of the law enforcement team threatening Ralph if he doesn’t frame Walter. 
While the judge refuses to grant Walter relief, Stevenson continues the appeal process through the Alabama courts. The district attorney asks outside agents to investigate the murder for which Walter was convicted, and the investigators determine that Walter had nothing to do with the crime. Six weeks later, the court invalidates Walter’s conviction. Stevenson and the State file a joint motion to dismiss the charges, and Walter is set free.
Throughout the process, Stevenson and Walter become close friends, and Stevenson helps Walter upon his release, including filing a civil suit on his behalf and offering him a place to stay. Walter works with Stevenson to share his story, giving interviews and speaking at legal conferences, and Walter is even featured in a documentary. Unfortunately, Walter is diagnosed with advancing dementia and is forced to rely on family and eventually a nursing facility for his care. He dies in 2013. Stevenson gives a eulogy at his funeral and shares all he learned from Walter, particularly that we must extend mercy to everyone, even those who have not earned it.
Interspersed with chapters chronicling Walter’s narrative are stories of Stevenson’s other clients and work. His closeness with these prisoners and their horrifying circumstances makes Stevenson more determined to help and causes him to reflect on abstract issues that nevertheless imbue the criminal justice system, like humanity and mercy. Stevenson focuses on several categories of vulnerable people who become trapped in the system, including mentally ill prisoners, disabled prisoners, and poor women who give birth to stillborn babies. 
Stevenson and his team at EJI also become increasingly focused on juvenile offenders who are sometimes tried as adults despite their young age. These offenders may be given de facto death sentences by being sentenced to life without parole and face perilous circumstances when they are housed in adult prisons. Stevenson illustrates how these prisoners retain their own humanity while being forced to live under inhumane conditions. He also discusses some of the qualities common among these types of prisoners: They are generally poor and disproportionately people of color, and most of them lack adequate legal counsel. The juveniles have horrific backgrounds of abuse and neglect.
Stevenson and his team at EJI also work to change the legal system to offer more protection to marginalized people. Several of his cases end up before the U.S. Supreme Court, and he succeeds in winning rulings that ban as unconstitutional the conviction of children to life without parole and the execution of people deemed incompetent from dementia or neurological disease. EJI works to raise public awareness of issues surrounding unfair incarceration, produces groundbreaking reports on racial issues, and sets up programs to help formerly incarcerated people adjust to life on the outside.
Stevenson also reflects on the issues that surround the criminal justice system. His time spent with prisoners awaiting their execution makes him realize how inhumane it is to prepare another human to die. After decades of work, when Stevenson fails to prevent the execution of a man who suffers from an intellectual disability, he momentarily feels unable to continue his work. However, he realizes that he cannot help but be broken by his experiences and comes to understand that it is his own brokenness that allows him to more fully understand the need for mercy and to bring compassion to others. The book ends with Stevenson’s renewed commitment to helping others."
Fast,"Guy Montag is a fireman who burns books in a futuristic American city. In Montag’s world, firemen start fires rather than putting them out. The people in this society do not read books, enjoy nature, spend time by themselves, think independently, or have meaningful conversations. Instead, they drive very fast, watch excessive amounts of television on wall-size sets, and listen to the radio on “Seashell Radio” sets attached to their ears.
Montag encounters a gentle seventeen-year-old girl named Clarisse McClellan, who opens his eyes to the emptiness of his life with her innocently penetrating questions and her unusual love of people and nature. Over the next few days, Montag experiences a series of disturbing events. First, his wife, Mildred, attempts suicide by swallowing a bottle of sleeping pills. Then, when he responds to an alarm that an old woman has a stash of hidden literature, the woman shocks him by choosing to be burned alive along with her books. A few days later, he hears that Clarisse has been killed by a speeding car. Montag’s dissatisfaction with his life increases, and he begins to search for a solution in a stash of books that he has stolen from his own fires and hidden inside an air-conditioning vent.
When Montag fails to show up for work, his fire chief, Beatty, pays a visit to his house. Beatty explains that it’s normal for a fireman to go through a phase of wondering what books have to offer, and he delivers a dizzying monologue explaining how books came to be banned in the first place. According to Beatty, special-interest groups and other “minorities” objected to books that offended them. Soon, books all began to look the same, as writers tried to avoid offending anybody. This was not enough, however, and society as a whole decided to simply burn books rather than permit conflicting opinions. Beatty tells Montag to take twenty-four hours or so to see if his stolen books contain anything worthwhile and then turn them in for incineration. Montag begins a long and frenzied night of reading.
Overwhelmed by the task of reading, Montag looks to his wife for help and support, but she prefers television to her husband’s company and cannot understand why he would want to take the terrible risk of reading books. He remembers that he once met a retired English professor named Faber sitting in a park, and he decides that this man might be able to help him understand what he reads. He visits Faber, who tells him that the value of books lies in the detailed awareness of life that they contain. Faber says that Montag needs not only books but also the leisure to read them and the freedom to act upon their ideas.
Faber agrees to help Montag with his reading, and they concoct a risky scheme to overthrow the status quo. Faber will contact a printer and begin reproducing books, and Montag will plant books in the homes of firemen to discredit the profession and to destroy the machinery of censorship. Faber gives him a two-way radio earpiece (the “green bullet”) so that he can hear what Montag hears and talk to him secretly.
Montag goes home, and soon two of his wife’s friends arrive to watch television. The women discuss their families and the war that is about to be declared in an extremely frivolous manner. Their superficiality angers him, and he takes out a book of poetry and reads “Dover Beach” by Matthew Arnold. Faber buzzes in his ear for him to be quiet, and Mildred tries to explain that the poetry reading is a standard way for firemen to demonstrate the uselessness of literature. The women are extremely disturbed by the poem and leave to file a complaint against Montag.
Montag goes to the fire station and hands over one of his books to Beatty. Beatty confuses Montag by barraging him with contradictory quotations from great books. Beatty exploits these contradictions to show that literature is morbid and dangerously complex, and that it deserves incineration. Suddenly, the alarm sounds, and they rush off to answer the call, only to find that the alarm is at Montag’s own house. Mildred gets into a cab with her suitcase, and Montag realizes that his own wife has betrayed him.
Beatty forces Montag to burn the house himself; when he is done, Beatty places him under arrest. When Beatty continues to berate Montag, Montag turns the flamethrower on his superior and proceeds to burn him to ashes. Montag knocks the other firemen unconscious and runs. The Mechanical Hound, a monstrous machine that Beatty has set to attack Montag, pounces and injects Montag’s leg with a large dose of anesthetic. Montag manages to destroy it with his flamethrower; then he walks off the numbness in his leg and escapes with some books that were hidden in his backyard. He hides these in another fireman’s house and calls in an alarm from a pay phone.
Montag goes to Faber’s house, where he learns that a new Hound has been put on his trail, along with several helicopters and a television crew. Faber tells Montag that he is leaving for St. Louis to see a retired printer who may be able to help them. Montag gives Faber some money and tells him how to remove Montag’s scent from his house so the Hound will not enter it. Montag then takes some of Faber’s old clothes and runs off toward the river. The whole city watches as the chase unfolds on TV, but Montag manages to escape in the river and change into Faber’s clothes to disguise his scent. He drifts downstream into the country and follows a set of abandoned railroad tracks until he finds a group of renegade intellectuals (“the Book People”), led by a man named Granger, who welcome him. They are a part of a nationwide network of book lovers who have memorized many great works of literature and philosophy. They hope that they may be of some help to mankind in the aftermath of the war that has just been declared. Montag’s role is to memorize the Book of Ecclesiastes. Enemy jets appear in the sky and completely obliterate the city with bombs. Montag and his new friends move on to search for survivors and rebuild civilization."

College,"Educated is primarily retrospective, consisting of Tara Westover's memories about her past. She tells the story of the events of her life from a vantage point in her late twenties, occasionally interjecting to comment on the process of trying to arrive at an accurate version of the past. Tara was born the youngest of seven children to parents whom she refers to as Faye and Gene (pseudonyms). The Westover family lived on a farm in rural Idaho, where Gene made a living salvaging scrap metal while Faye worked as an unlicensed midwife and herbal healer. Gene suffered from paranoid fears about interference from the federal government, and as a result he refused to allow his children to attend school, receive birth certificates, or receive medical attention. Gene was also a devout Mormon who believed in radical self-sufficiency and an impending Day of Judgement.
		
Shifts in the Westover family dynamic began to emerge when Tara was about nine. Her mother's work as a midwife increased her sense of independence, but after sustaining a serious and untreated brain injury in a car accident, Faye began to lose confidence in her skills, and focused instead on using herbal remedies and a form of intuitive healing. Around this time, Tyler (the third son) announced that he was going to attend college, which estranged him from his family. Tyler's absence forced Tara to become more involved in helping her father with his scrapping work, which left her constantly exposed to the possibility of dangerous injury. It also made her more curious about possibly pursuing an education herself. When Tara was ten, she told her disapproving father that she wanted to begin going to school, but nothing came of the idea.
As Tara grew into her teens, she acquired more independence from her family due to taking on various jobs and pursuing singing and musical theatre in the local community. However, her life was dominated by the strict rules and religious doctrine her father imposed, and Tara often worried about becoming sinful. When Tara was thirteen, her older brother Shawn moved back home. At first Shawn and Tara were close and spent a lot of time together. When Tara was about fifteen, however, Shawn began to be physically abusive toward her. His behavior only got worse after Shawn experienced a head injury. Tyler eventually realized that Shawn was hurting Tara, and he urged Tara to seriously consider applying to college and getting away from the family. Although she was uncertain at first, Tara began to study and was eventually accepted at Brigham Young University, having passed herself off as homeschooled.
In January 2004, when Tara was seventeen years old, she moved to Utah to begin her college education. She found the adjustment very difficult at first, but eventually began to excel in her studies. Tara's finances were precarious, and she had to hold multiple jobs and maintain very high grades to retain her scholarship. Her emerging independence also caused a threatening dynamic between her, Gene, and Shawn. Whenever Tara returned to Buck's Peak, her father manipulated her into working for him, while Shawn continued to physically and emotionally abuse her. Tara eventually confided to a bishop about her life, and he helped her to secure funding to finance her education. Tara's studies, and the people she met, also gradually opened her eyes to different realities and force her to realize how damaging and isolating her childhood has been. Tara eventually changed her major to studying history, and is encouraged to apply for a study abroad program at Cambridge University in England.
Tara's experience at Cambridge broadened her horizons even further, and she was encouraged to consider graduate studies. Tara still felt isolated from her peers, and ashamed of her origins. She hid most of her past even from her friends and the men she occasionally dated. She was eventually awarded a prestigious Cambridge Gates Fellowship and moved to England to pursue a Master's degree. She remained in close contact with her family and returned to Idaho regularly to visit, but her relationship with them deteriorated. Shawn was growing increasingly erratic and violent, and Tara feared for the safety of his wife and young child. By chance, she revealed to her sister Audrey that Shawn had been abusive with her, and Audrey later confided that Shawn abused her as well. Audrey blamed herself for not protecting her younger sister, and suggested that she and Tara confront their parents and Shawn about what happened to them.
By then Tara had built a happy life for herself in England, and was working on a PhD in history at Cambridge. However, the attempt to speak the truth quickly became a source of conflict in the family. Tara became more and more ostracized within her family, eventually culminating in Shawn learning that she had been telling their parents about the abuse she suffered. Realizing her family would never trust her claims, Tara became estranged from most of them, with the exception of Tyler.  The estrangement from her family prompted grief and depression for Tara, but she was finally able to heal, and successfully completed her PhD. By the end of her memoir, Tara has accepted that she may never have a relationship with her family again, but she takes pride in the independence she has established, and the life she has built for herself."
Oregon,"Two migrant workers, George and Lennie, have been let off a bus miles away from the California farm where they are due to start work. George is a small, dark man with “sharp, strong features.” Lennie, his companion, is his opposite, a giant of a man with a “shapeless” face. Overcome with thirst, the two stop in a clearing by a pool and decide to camp for the night. As the two converse, it becomes clear that Lennie has an intellectual disability, and is deeply devoted to George and dependent upon him for protection and guidance. George finds that Lennie, who loves petting soft things but often accidentally kills them, has been carrying and stroking a dead mouse. George angrily throws it away, fearing that Lennie might catch a disease from the dead animal. George complains loudly that his life would be easier without having to care for Lennie, but the reader senses that their friendship and devotion is mutual. He and Lennie share a dream of buying their own piece of land, farming it, and, much to Lennie’s delight, keeping rabbits. George ends the night by treating Lennie to the story he often tells him about what life will be like in such an idyllic place.
The next day, the men report to the nearby ranch. George, fearing how the boss will react to Lennie, insists that he’ll do all the talking. He lies, explaining that they travel together because they are cousins and that a horse kicked Lennie in the head when he was a child. They are hired. They meet Candy, an old “swamper,” or handyman, with a missing hand and an ancient dog, and Curley, the boss’s mean-spirited son. Curley is newly married, possessive of his flirtatious wife, and full of jealous suspicion. Once George and Lennie are alone in the bunkhouse, Curley’s wife appears and flirts with them. Lennie thinks she is “purty,” but George, sensing the trouble that could come from tangling with this woman and her husband, warns Lennie to stay away from her. Soon, the ranch-hands return from the fields for lunch, and George and Lennie meet Slim, the skilled mule driver who wields great authority on the ranch. Slim comments on the rarity of friendship like that between George and Lennie. Carlson, another ranch-hand, suggests that since Slim’s dog has just given birth, they should offer a puppy to Candy and shoot Candy’s old, good-for-nothing dog.
The next day, George confides in Slim that he and Lennie are not cousins, but have been friends since childhood. He tells how Lennie has often gotten them into trouble. For instance, they were forced to flee their last job because Lennie tried to touch a woman’s dress and was accused of rape. Slim agrees to give Lennie one of his puppies, and Carlson continues to badger Candy to kill his old dog. When Slim agrees with Carlson, saying that death would be a welcome relief to the suffering animal, Candy gives in. Carlson, before leading the dog outside, promises to do the job painlessly.
Slim goes to the barn to do some work, and Curley, who is maniacally searching for his wife, heads to the barn to accost Slim. Candy overhears George and Lennie discussing their plans to buy land, and offers his life’s savings if they will let him live there too. The three make a pact to let no one else know of their plan. Slim returns to the bunkhouse, berating Curley for his suspicions. Curley, searching for an easy target for his anger, finds Lennie and picks a fight with him. Lennie crushes Curley’s hand in the altercation. Slim warns Curley that if he tries to get George and Lennie fired, he will be the laughingstock of the farm.
The next night, most of the men go to the local brothel. Lennie is left with Crooks, the lonely, Black stable-hand, and Candy. Curley’s wife flirts with them, refusing to leave until the other men come home. She notices the cuts on Lennie’s face and suspects that he, and not a piece of machinery as Curley claimed, is responsible for hurting her husband. This thought amuses her. The next day, Lennie accidentally kills his puppy in the barn. Curley’s wife enters and consoles him. She admits that life with Curley is a disappointment, and wishes that she had followed her dream of becoming a movie star. Lennie tells her that he loves petting soft things, and she offers to let him feel her hair. When he grabs too tightly, she cries out. In his attempt to silence her, he accidentally breaks her neck.
Lennie flees back to a pool of the Salinas River that George had designated as a meeting place should either of them get into trouble. As the men back at the ranch discover what has happened and gather together a lynch party, George joins Lennie. Much to Lennie’s surprise, George is not mad at him for doing “a bad thing.” George begins to tell Lennie the story of the farm they will have together. As he describes the rabbits that Lennie will tend, the sound of the approaching lynch party grows louder. George shoots his friend in the back of the head.
When the other men arrive, George lets them believe that Lennie had the gun, and George wrestled it away from him and shot him. Only Slim understands what has really happened, that George has killed his friend out of mercy. Slim consolingly leads him away, and the other men, completely puzzled, watch them leave."
Machine,"A group of men, including the narrator, is listening to the Time Traveller discuss his theory that time is the fourth dimension. The Time Traveller produces a miniature time machine and makes it disappear into thin air. The next week, the guests return, to find their host stumble in, looking disheveled and tired. They sit down after dinner, and the Time Traveller begins his story.
The Time Traveller had finally finished work on his time machine, and it rocketed him into the future. When the machine stops, in the year 802,701 AD, he finds himself in a paradisiacal world of small humanoid creatures called Eloi. They are frail and peaceful, and give him fruit to eat. He explores the area, but when he returns he finds that his time machine is gone. He decides that it has been put inside the pedestal of a nearby statue. He tries to pry it open but cannot. In the night, he begins to catch glimpses of strange white ape-like creatures the Eloi call Morlocks. He decides that the Morlocks live below ground, down the wells that dot the landscape. Meanwhile, he saves one of the Eloi from drowning, and she befriends him. Her name is Weena. The Time Traveller finally works up enough courage to go down into the world of Morlocks to try to retrieve his time machine. He finds that matches are a good defense against the Morlocks, but ultimately they chase him out of their realm. Frightened by the Morlocks, he takes Weena to try to find a place where they will be safe from the Morlocks' nocturnal hunting. He goes to what he calls the Palace of Green Porcelain, which turns out to be a museum. There, he finds more matches, some camphor, and a lever he can use as a weapon. That night, retreating from the Morlocks through a giant wood, he accidentally starts a fire. Many Morlocks die in the fire and the battle that ensues, and Weena is killed. The exhausted Time Traveller returns to the pedestal to find that it has already been pried open. He strides in confidently, and just when the Morlocks think that they have trapped him, he springs onto the machine and whizzes into the future.
The Time Traveller makes several more stops. In a distant time he stops on a beach where he is attacked by giant crabs. The bloated red sun sits motionless in the sky. He then travels thirty million years into the future. The air is very thin, and the only sign of life is a black blob with tentacles. He sees a planet eclipse the sun. He then returns, exhausted, to the present time. The next day, he leaves again, but never returns."
Money,"A Raisin in the Sun portrays a few weeks in the life of the Youngers, a Black family living on the South Side of Chicago in the 1950s. When the play opens, the Youngers are about to receive an insurance check for $10,000. This money comes from the deceased Mr. Younger’s life insurance policy. Each of the adult members of the family has an idea as to what he or she would like to do with this money. The matriarch of the family, Mama, wants to buy a house to fulfill a dream she shared with her husband. Mama’s son, Walter Lee, would rather use the money to invest in a liquor store with his friends. He believes that the investment will solve the family’s financial problems forever. Walter’s wife, Ruth, agrees with Mama, however, and hopes that she and Walter can provide more space and opportunity for their son, Travis. Finally, Beneatha, Walter’s sister and Mama’s daughter, wants to use the money for her medical school tuition. She also wishes that her family members were not so interested in assimilating into the white world. Beneatha instead tries to find her identity by looking back to the past and to Africa.
As the play progresses, the Youngers clash over their competing dreams. Ruth discovers that she is pregnant but fears that if she has the child, she will put more financial pressure on her family members. When Walter says nothing to Ruth’s admission that she is considering abortion, Mama puts a down payment on a house for the whole family. She believes that a bigger, brighter dwelling will help them all. This house is in Clybourne Park, an entirely white neighborhood. When the Youngers’ future neighbors find out that the Youngers are moving in, they send Mr. Lindner, from the Clybourne Park Improvement Association, to offer the Youngers money in return for staying away. The Youngers refuse the deal, even after Walter loses the rest of the money ($6,500) to his friend Willy Harris, who persuades Walter to invest in the liquor store and then runs off with his cash.
In the meantime, Beneatha rejects her suitor, George Murchison, whom she believes to be shallow and blind to the problems of race. Subsequently, she receives a marriage proposal from her Nigerian boyfriend, Joseph Asagai, who wants Beneatha to get a medical degree and move to Africa with him (Beneatha does not make her choice before the end of the play). The Youngers eventually move out of the apartment, fulfilling the family’s long-held dream. Their future seems uncertain and slightly dangerous, but they are optimistic and determined to live a better life. They believe that they can succeed if they stick together as a family and resolve to defer their dreams no longer."
Office,"Stephen Dedalus spends the early morning hours of June 16, 1904, remaining aloof from his mocking friend, Buck Mulligan, and Buck’s English acquaintance, Haines. As Stephen leaves for work, Buck orders him to leave the house key and meet them at the pub at 12:30. Stephen resents Buck.
	Around 10:00 A.M., Stephen teaches a history lesson to his class at Garrett Deasy’s boys’ school. After class, Stephen meets with Deasy to receive his wages. The narrow-minded and prejudiced Deasy lectures Stephen on life. Stephen agrees to take Deasy’s editorial letter about cattle disease to acquaintances at the newspaper. 
	Stephen spends the remainder of his morning walking alone on Sandymount Strand, thinking critically about his younger self and about perception. He composes a poem in his head and writes it down on a scrap torn from Deasy’s letter. 
	At 8:00 A.M. the same morning, Leopold Bloom fixes breakfast and brings his wife her mail and breakfast in bed. One of her letters is from Molly’s concert tour manager, Blazes Boylan (Bloom suspects he is also Molly’s lover)—Boylan will visit at 4:00 this afternoon. Bloom returns downstairs, reads a letter from their daughter, Milly, then goes to the outhouse. 
	At 10:00 A.M., Bloom picks up an amorous letter from the post office—he is corresponding with a woman named Martha Clifford under the pseudonym Henry Flower. He reads the tepid letter, ducks briefly into a church, then orders Molly’s lotion from the pharmacist. He runs into Bantam Lyons, who mistakenly gets the impression that Bloom is giving him a tip on the horse Throwaway in the afternoon’s Gold Cup race.
	Around 11:00 A.M., Bloom rides with Simon Dedalus (Stephen’s father), Martin Cunningham, and Jack Power to the funeral of Paddy Dignam. The men treat Bloom as somewhat of an outsider. At the funeral, Bloom thinks about the deaths of his son and his father.
	At noon, we find Bloom at the offices of the Freeman newspaper, negotiating an advertisement for Keyes, a liquor merchant. Several idle men, including editor Myles Crawford, are hanging around in the office, discussing political speeches. Bloom leaves to secure the ad. Stephen arrives at the newspaper with Deasy’s letter. Stephen and the other men leave for the pub just as Bloom is returning. Bloom’s ad negotiation is rejected by Crawford on his way out.
	At 1:00 P.M., Bloom runs into Josie Breen, an old flame, and they discuss Mina Purefoy, who is in labor at the maternity hospital. Bloom stops in Burton’s restaurant, but he decides to move on to Davy Byrne’s for a light lunch. Bloom reminisces about an intimate afternoon with Molly on Howth. Bloom leaves and is walking toward the National Library when he spots Boylan on the street and ducks into the National Museum.
	At 2:00 P.M., Stephen is informally presenting his “Hamlet theory” in the National Library to the poet A.E. and the librarians John Eglinton, Best, and Lyster. A.E. is dismissive of Stephen’s theory and leaves. Buck enters and jokingly scolds Stephen for failing to meet him and Haines at the pub. On the way out, Buck and Stephen pass Bloom, who has come to obtain a copy of Keyes’ ad.
	At 4:00 P.M., Simon Dedalus, Ben Dollard, Lenehan, and Blazes Boylan converge at the Ormond Hotel bar. Bloom notices Boylan’s car outside and decides to watch him. Boylan soon leaves for his appointment with Molly, and Bloom sits morosely in the Ormond restaurant—he is briefly mollified by Dedalus’s and Dollard’s singing. Bloom writes back to Martha, then leaves to post the letter.
	At 5:00 P.M., Bloom arrives at Barney Kiernan’s pub to meet Martin Cunningham about the Dignam family finances, but Cunningham has not yet arrived. The citizen, a belligerent Irish nationalist, becomes increasingly drunk and begins attacking Bloom’s Jewishness. Bloom stands up to the citizen, speaking in favor of peace and love over xenophobic violence. Bloom and the citizen have an altercation on the street before Cunningham’s carriage carries Bloom away.
	Bloom relaxes on Sandymount Strand around sunset, after his visit to Mrs. Dignam’s house nearby. A young woman, Gerty MacDowell, notices Bloom watching her from across the beach. Gerty subtly reveals more and more of her legs while Bloom surreptitiously masturbates. Gerty leaves, and Bloom dozes. 
	At 10:00 P.M., Bloom wanders to the maternity hospital to check on Mina Purefoy. Also at the hospital are Stephen and several of his medi-c-al student friends, drinking and talking boisterously about subjects related to birth. Bloom agrees to join them, though he privately disapproves of their revelry in light of Mrs. Purefoy’s struggles upstairs. Buck arrives, and the men proceed to Burke’s pub. At closing time, Stephen convinces his friend Lynch to go to the brothel section of town and Bloom follows, feeling protective.
	Bloom finally locates Stephen and Lynch at Bella Cohen’s brothel. Stephen is drunk and imagines that he sees the ghost of his mother—full of rage, he shatters a lamp with his walking stick. Bloom runs after Stephen and finds him in an argument with a British soldier who knocks him out.
	Bloom revives Stephen and takes him for coffee at a cabman’s shelter to sober up. Bloom invites Stephen back to his house.
	Well after midnight, Stephen and Bloom arrive back at Bloom’s house. They drink cocoa and talk about their respective backgrounds. Bloom asks Stephen to stay the night. Stephen politely refuses. Bloom sees him out and comes back in to find evidence of Boylan’s visit. Still, Bloom is at peace with the world and he climbs into bed, tells Molly of his day and requests breakfast in bed. 
After Bloom falls asleep, Molly remains awake, surprised by Bloom’s request for breakfast in bed. Her mind wanders to her childhood in Gibraltar, her afternoon of sex with Boylan, her singing career, Stephen Dedalus. Her thoughts of Bloom vary wildly over the course of the monologue, but it ends with a reminiscence of their intimate moment at Howth and a positive affirmation."
Speaks,"Speak, by Laurie Halse Anderson, chronicles the struggles of thirteen-year-old Melinda Sordino after she is a raped by at a party the summer before her freshman year of high school by another student. Melinda tells her story in first person narrative. She describes events within the framework of the four marking periods of the school year.
In the opening part of Speak, “First Marking Period,” Melinda begins high school, and we learn that former friends now hate her. She experiences humiliation in the cafeteria and Mr. Neck, a social studies teacher, further embarrasses her by giving her demerits on the first day of school. Ostracized by her former friends, she befriends Heather, a new girl at the school. Heather seeks popularity, and she badgers Melinda to join various clubs. Rachel, Melinda’s ex-best friend, hasn’t tried to find out the truth about what really happened to Melinda that night at the party over the summer.
Melinda describes her classes, activities, and thoughts. Her project in Mr. Freeman’s art class is to create a work of art based on a “tree,” which is the object named on the piece of paper she randomly chooses. In biology, Melinda thinks that David Petrakis, her lab partner, might be cute without the braces. And in algebra, when Mr. Stetman has Rachel come to the board to help Melinda with a problem, Melinda is humiliated. 
Melinda often skips class using stolen late passes and doesn’t complete her homework. She finds refuge at school in a vacant janitor’s closet, which she turns into her “burrow.” At the Homecoming Rally, students bully her for being the one who called the cops that night at the party.
At home, Melinda and her parents communicate with each other by leaving notes on the refrigerator. In her bedroom, she no longer wants to look in the mirror and puts it in the back of her closet. Toward the end of the marking period, Melinda’s parents hear from the school about her missing work, and she remains silent while they berate her for failing. Through it all, Melinda sees “IT” everywhere, the nightmare from which she cannot awaken.
In “Second Marking Period,” school is a grind for Melinda. At her parents’ insistence, she stays after to finish her homework, but she goes to her burrow and naps instead. In social studies, David Petrakis stands up against Mr. Neck’s racist rant about immigration. In biology, she finds that a seed within the apple she has cut is already growing. Heather gives her an early Christmas present, and Melinda decides she’ll give Heather a friendship necklace. 
On Christmas, Melinda nearly tells her parents what happened that night last summer but can’t. Winter break is miserable. Her parents keep her busy working for them, and she is relieved when school starts again. 
In gym class, Melinda impresses the basketball coaches with skills but has no interest in being on the team. She reluctantly helps Heather in her attempts to become an initiated member of a do-good club. And in biology, when she and David dissect a frog, she faints when preparing to slice it open. 
Melinda’s parents receive another call from the guidance counselor about her grades. After their verbal assault, Melinda goes to her room and uses an open paper clip to scrape at her wrist. 
“IT”, who we learn is Andy Evans, harasses Melinda in the cafeteria, and she runs to the bathroom to vomit. She has yet to tell anyone, even the reader, about what happened that summer night.
In “Third Marking Period,” Melinda continues to skip school and avoid Andy Evans. Heather ends their friendship suddenly, and later returns the friendship necklace Melinda had given her for Christmas. No one, Melinda is sure, “would like the inside girl I think I am.” 
The school counselors hold another meeting with Melinda’s parents, who berate and threaten her. She refuses to talk or defend herself. She receives In-School Suspension, and IT is there. He sits next to her and blows in her ear when Mr. Neck isn’t looking. 
In art class, Mr. Freeman gives Melinda a book about Picasso to help her “paralyzed” imagination. Picasso’s art inspires her, and she begins to draw. Mr. Freeman recognizes that she has a lot to say.
Melinda works to meet the expectations set for her. Yet, with “no friends in the known universe,” Melinda sits alone at lunch, wondering if everyone is talking and laughing about her. 
One afternoon, after a basketball game, David Petrakis invites her to his house for pizza to celebrate the team’s one-point win. She declines, torn between getting a life, and the fact that the world is a dangerous place.
At last, Melinda reveals that she was attacked at a party last summer, though she does not use the word “rape.” At this point, we (the readers) are the only ones besides Melinda who know what happened.
In “Fourth Marking Period,” Melinda takes her ex-friend Ivy’s advice and tries drawing a tree instead of carving one from linoleum block. She also learns that Rachel is dating Andy Evans. Compelled to do something, she writes a note to Rachel warning her about Andy. In the note, she admits for the first time (but without divulging her identity), that she was raped. 
Springtime arrives, and Melinda finds solace working in the garden. She and David plan a protest in social studies class over an oral report she is supposed to present, and she stands up to Heather by refusing to help her decorate for the Senior Prom. She writes on a stall in the bathroom, “Guys to Stay Away From: Andy Evans.” Andy Evans continues to bully her. 
Melinda feels compelled to tell Rachel the truth about Andy and what happened that night. But, when Rachel learns that Andy Evans was Melinda’s attacker, she accuses Melinda of being jealous and calls her a “twisted little freak.” Later, Ivy brings Melinda into the bathroom stall. Other girls have added words like “creep” and “bastard” under Andy Evan’s name. Seeing that, Melinda feels like she can fly.
Melinda realizes she doesn’t need her burrow anymore. When she is clearing her items out of the closet, Andy Evans barges in, attacks Melinda, and tries to rape her again. She finds her voice and screams “NNNOOO!!” He does not back off, so Melinda breaks a mirror, takes a shard of glass, and holds it to his neck. “I said no,” she tells him. People who had heard her scream run for help.
With hours left in the school year, Melinda finds herself a sort of hero. She finishes her tree project, receiving an A+ from Mr. Freeman."
Selma,"The Bottom is a mostly Black community in Ohio, situated in the hills above the mostly white, wealthier community of Medallion. The Bottom first became a community when a master gave it to his former slave. This ""gift"" was in fact a trick: the master gave the former slave a poor stretch of hilly land, convincing the slave the land was worthwhile by claiming that because it was hilly, it was closer to heaven. The trick, though, led to the growth of a vibrant community. Now the community faces a new threat; wealthy whites have taken a liking to the land, and would like to destroy much of the town in order to build a golf course.
Shadrack, a resident of the Bottom, fought in WWI. He returns a shattered man, unable to accept the complexities of the world; he lives on the outskirts of town, attempting to create order in his life. One of his methods involves compartmentalizing his fear of death in a ritual he invents and names National Suicide Day. The town is at first wary of him and his ritual, then, over time, unthinkingly accepts him.
Meanwhile, the families of the children Nel and Sula are contrasted. Nel is the product of a family that believes deeply in social conventions; hers is a stable home, though some might characterize it as rigid. Nel is uncertain of the conventional life her mother, Helene, wants for her; these doubts are hammered home when she meets Rochelle, her grandmother and a former prostitute, the only unconventional woman in her family line. Sula's family is very different: she lives with her grandmother, Eva, and her mother, Hannah, both of whom are seen by the town as eccentric and loose. Their house also serves as a home for three informally adopted boys and a steady stream of borders.
Despite their differences, Sula and Nel become fiercely attached to each other during adolescence. However, a traumatic accident changes everything. One day, Sula playfully swings a neighborhood boy, Chicken Little, around by his hands. When she loses her grip, the boy falls into a nearby river and drowns. They never tell anyone about the accident even though they did not intend to harm the boy. The two girls begin to grow apart. One day, in an accident, Sula's mother's dress catches fire and she dies of the burns.
After high school, Nel chooses to marry and settles into the conventional role of wife and mother. Sula follows a wildly divergent path and lives a life of fierce independence and total disregard for social conventions. Shortly after Nel's wedding, Sula leaves the Bottom for a period of 10 years. She has many affairs, some with white men. However, she finds people following the same boring routines elsewhere, so she returns to the Bottom and to Nel.
Upon her return, the town regards Sula as the very personification of evil for her blatant disregard of social conventions. Their hatred in part rests upon Sula's interracial relationships, but is crystallized when Sula has an affair with Nel's husband, Jude, who subsequently abandons Nel. Ironically, the community's labeling of Sula as evil actually improves their own lives. Her presence in the community gives them the impetus to live harmoniously with one another. Nel breaks off her friendship with Sula. Just before Sula dies in 1940, they achieve a half-hearted reconciliation. With Sula's death, the harmony that had reigned in the town quickly dissolves.
In 1965, with the Bottom facing the prospect of the white golf course, Nel visits Eva in the nursing home. Eva accuses her of sharing the guilt for Chicken Little's death. Her accusation forces Nel to confront the unfairness of her judgment against Sula. Nel admits to herself that she had blamed his death entirely on Sula and set herself up as the ""good"" half of the relationship. Nel comes to realize that in the aftermath of Chicken Little's death she had too quickly clung to social convention in an effort to define herself as ""good."" Nel goes to the cemetery and mourns at Sula's grave, calling out Sula's name in sadness.
Sula is a novel about ambiguity. It questions and examines the terms ""good"" and ""evil,"" often demonstrating that the two often resemble one another. The novel addresses the confusing mysteries of human emotions and relationships, ultimately concluding that social conventions are inadequate as a foundation for living one's life. The novel tempts the reader to apply the diametrically opposed terms of ""good and evil,"" ""right and wrong"" to the characters and their actions, and yet simultaneously shows why it is necessary to resist such temptation. While exploring the ways in which people try to make meaning of lives filled with conflicts over race, gender, and simple idiosyncratic points of views, Sula resists easy answers, demonstrating the ambiguity, beauty, and terror of life, in both its triumphs and horrors."
Thy,"The protagonist, who is named Tim O’Brien, begins by describing an event that occurred in the middle of his Vietnam experience. “The Things They Carried” catalogs the variety of things his fellow soldiers in the Alpha Company brought on their missions. Several of these things are intangible, including guilt and fear, while others are specific physical objects, including matches, morphine, M-16 rifles, and M&M’s candy.
Throughout the collection, the same characters reappear in various stories. The first member of the Alpha Company to die is Ted Lavender, a “grunt,” or low-ranking soldier, who deals with his anxiety about the war by taking tranquilizers and smoking marijuana. Lavender is shot in the head on his way back from going to the bathroom, and his superior, Lieutenant Jimmy Cross, blames himself for the tragedy. When Lavender is shot, Cross is distracting himself with thoughts of Martha, a college crush. It is revealed in “Love” that Cross’s feelings for Martha, whom he dated once before leaving for Vietnam, were never reciprocated, and that even twenty years after the war, his guilt over Lavender’s death remains.
In “On the Rainy River,” the narrator, O’Brien, explains the series of events that led him to Vietnam in the first place. He receives his draft notice in June of 1968, and his feelings of confusion drive him north to the Canadian border, which he contemplates crossing so that he will not be forced to fight in a war in which he doesn’t believe. Sitting in a rowboat with the proprietor of the Tip Top Lodge, where he stays, O’Brien decides that his guilt about avoiding the war and fear of disappointing his family are more important than his political convictions. He soon leaves, going first back home to Worthington, Minnesota and later to Vietnam.
In addition to Ted Lavender, a few other members of the Alpha Company are killed during their mission overseas, including Curt Lemon, who is killed when he steps on a rigged mortar round. Though O’Brien is not close to Lemon, in “The Dentist,” he tells a story of how Lemon, who faints before a routine checkup with an army-issued dentist, tries to save face by insisting that a perfectly good tooth be pulled. Lee Strunk, another member of the company, dies from injuries he sustains by stepping on a landmine. In “Friends,” O’Brien remembers that before Strunk was fatally hurt, Strunk and Dave Jensen had made a pact that if either man were irreparably harmed, the other man would see that he was quickly killed. However, when Strunk is actually hurt, he begs Jensen to spare him, and Jensen complies. Instead of being upset by the news of his friend’s swift death en route to treatment, Jensen is relieved.
The death that receives the most attention in The Things They Carried is that of Kiowa, a much-loved member of the Alpha Company and one of O’Brien’s closest friends. In “Speaking of Courage,” the story of Kiowa’s death is relayed in retrospect through the memory of Norman Bowker, years after the war. As Bowker drives around a lake in his Iowa hometown, he thinks that he failed to save Kiowa, who was killed when a mortar round hit and caused him to sink headfirst into a marshy field. O’Brien realizes that he has dealt with his guilt over Kiowa’s death differently than Norman Bowker in “Notes.” Just before the end of the war, O’Brien receives a long letter from Bowker that says he hasn’t found a way to make life meaningful after the war. O’Brien resolves to tell Bowker’s story, and the story of Kiowa’s death, in order to negotiate his own feelings of guilt and hollowness.
Like “Love” and “Notes,” several of O’Brien’s stories are told from a perspective twenty years after the Vietnam War, when he is a forty-three-year-old writer living in Massachusetts. Exposure to the guilt of old friends like Jimmy Cross and Norman Bowker prompts him to write stories in order to understand what they were going through. But two stories, “The Man I Killed” and “Ambush,” are written so that O’Brien can confront his own guilt over killing a man with a grenade outside the village of My Khe. In “The Man I Killed,” O’Brien imagines the life of his victim, from his childhood to the way things would have turned out for him had O’Brien not spotted him on a path and thrown a grenade at his feet. In “Ambush,” O’Brien imagines how he might relay the story of the man he killed to his nine-year-old daughter, Kathleen. In this second story, O’Brien provides more details of the actual killing—including the sound of the grenade and his own feelings—and explains that even well after the fact, he hasn’t finished sorting out the experience.
In the last story, “The Lives of the Dead,” O’Brien gives another twist to his contention that stories have the power to save people. In the stories of Curt Lemon and Kiowa, O’Brien explains that his imagination allowed him to grapple successfully with his guilt and confusion over the death of his fourth-grade first love, Linda."
Forbids,"Winston Smith is a low-ranking member of the ruling Party in London, in the nation of Oceania. Everywhere Winston goes, even his own home, the Party watches him through telescreens; everywhere he looks he sees the face of the Party’s seemingly omniscient leader, a figure known only as Big Brother. The Party controls everything in Oceania, even the people’s history and language. Currently, the Party is forcing the implementation of an invented language called Newspeak, which attempts to prevent political rebellion by eliminating all words related to it. Even thinking rebellious thoughts is illegal. Such thoughtcrime is, in fact, the worst of all crimes.
As the novel opens, Winston feels frustrated by the oppression and rigid control of the Party, which prohibits free thought, sex, and any expression of individuality. Winston dislikes the party and has illegally purchased a diary in which to write his criminal thoughts. He has also become fixated on a powerful Party member named O’Brien, whom Winston believes is a secret member of the Brotherhood—the mysterious, legendary group that works to overthrow the Party.
Winston works in the Ministry of Truth, where he alters historical records to fit the needs of the Party. He notices a coworker, a beautiful dark-haired girl, staring at him, and worries that she is an informant who will turn him in for his thoughtcrime. He is troubled by the Party’s control of history: the Party claims that Oceania has always been allied with Eastasia in a war against Eurasia, but Winston seems to recall a time when this was not true. The Party also claims that Emmanuel Goldstein, the alleged leader of the Brotherhood, is the most dangerous man alive, but this does not seem plausible to Winston. Winston spends his evenings wandering through the poorest neighborhoods in London, where the proletarians, or proles, live squalid lives, relatively free of Party monitoring.
One day, Winston receives a note from the dark-haired girl that reads “I love you.” She tells him her name, Julia, and they begin a covert affair, always on the lookout for signs of Party monitoring. Eventually they rent a room above the secondhand store in the prole district where Winston bought the diary. This relationship lasts for some time. Winston is sure that they will be caught and punished sooner or later (the fatalistic Winston knows that he has been doomed since he wrote his first diary entry), while Julia is more pragmatic and optimistic. As Winston’s affair with Julia progresses, his hatred for the Party grows more and more intense. At last, he receives the message that he has been waiting for: O’Brien wants to see him.
Winston and Julia travel to O’Brien’s luxurious apartment. As a member of the powerful Inner Party (Winston belongs to the Outer Party), O’Brien leads a life of luxury that Winston can only imagine. O’Brien confirms to Winston and Julia that, like them, he hates the Party, and says that he works against it as a member of the Brotherhood. He indoctrinates Winston and Julia into the Brotherhood, and gives Winston a copy of Emmanuel Goldstein’s book, the manifesto of the Brotherhood. Winston reads the book—an amalgam of several forms of class-based twentieth-century social theory—to Julia in the room above the store. Suddenly, soldiers barge in and seize them. Mr. Charrington, the proprietor of the store, is revealed as having been a member of the Thought Police all along.
Torn away from Julia and taken to a place called the Ministry of Love, Winston finds that O’Brien, too, is a Party spy who simply pretended to be a member of the Brotherhood in order to trap Winston into committing an open act of rebellion against the Party. O’Brien spends months torturing and brainwashing Winston, who struggles to resist. At last, O’Brien sends him to the dreaded Room 101, the final destination for anyone who opposes the Party. Here, O’Brien tells Winston that he will be forced to confront his worst fear. Throughout the novel, Winston has had recurring nightmares about rats; O’Brien now straps a cage full of rats onto Winston’s head and prepares to allow the rats to eat his face. Winston snaps, pleading with O’Brien to do it to Julia, not to him.
Giving up Julia is what O’Brien wanted from Winston all along. His spirit broken, Winston is released to the outside world. He meets Julia but no longer feels anything for her. He has accepted the Party entirely and has learned to love Big Brother."
To,"Scout Finch lives with her brother, Jem, and their widowed father, Atticus, in the sleepy Alabama town of Maycomb. Maycomb is suffering through the Great Depression, but Atticus is a prominent lawyer and the Finch family is reasonably well off in comparison to the rest of society. One summer, Jem and Scout befriend a boy named Dill, who has come to live in their neighborhood for the summer, and the trio acts out stories together. Eventually, Dill becomes fascinated with the spooky house on their street called the Radley Place. The house is owned by Mr. Nathan Radley, whose brother, Arthur (nicknamed Boo), has lived there for years without venturing outside.
Scout goes to school for the first time that fall and detests it. She and Jem find gifts apparently left for them in a knothole of a tree on the Radley property. Dill returns the following summer, and he, Scout, and Jem begin to act out the story of Boo Radley. Atticus puts a stop to their antics, urging the children to try to see life from another person’s perspective before making judgments. But, on Dill’s last night in Maycomb for the summer, the three sneak onto the Radley property, where Nathan Radley shoots at them. Jem loses his pants in the ensuing escape. When he returns for them, he finds them mended and hung over the fence.
The next winter, Jem and Scout find more presents in the tree, presumably left by the mysterious Boo. Nathan Radley eventually plugs the knothole with cement. Shortly thereafter, a fire breaks out in another neighbor’s house, and during the fire someone slips a blanket on Scout’s shoulders as she watches the blaze. Convinced that Boo did it, Jem tells Atticus about the mended pants and the presents.
To the consternation of Maycomb’s racist white community, Atticus agrees to defend a Black man named Tom Robinson, who has been accused of raping a white woman. Because of Atticus’s decision, Jem and Scout are subjected to abuse from other children, even when they celebrate Christmas at the family compound on Finch’s Landing. Calpurnia, the Finches’ Black cook, takes them to the local Black church, where the warm and close-knit community largely embraces the children.
Atticus’s sister, Alexandra, comes to live with the Finches the next summer. Dill, who is supposed to live with his “new father” in another town, runs away and comes to Maycomb. Tom Robinson’s trial begins, and when the accused man is placed in the local jail, a mob gathers to lynch him. Atticus faces the mob down the night before the trial. Jem and Scout, who have sneaked out of the house, soon join him. Scout recognizes one of the men, and her polite questioning about his son shames him into dispersing the mob.
At the trial itself, the children sit in the “colored balcony” with the town’s Black citizens. Atticus provides clear evidence that the accusers, Mayella Ewell and her father, Bob, are lying: in fact, Mayella propositioned Tom Robinson, was caught by her father, and then accused Tom of rape to cover her shame and guilt. Atticus provides impressive evidence that the marks on Mayella’s face are from wounds that her father inflicted; upon discovering her with Tom, he called her a whore and beat her. Yet, despite the significant evidence pointing to Tom’s innocence, the all-white jury convicts him. The innocent Tom later tries to escape from prison and is shot to death. In the aftermath of the trial, Jem’s faith in justice is badly shaken, and he lapses into despondency and doubt.
Despite the verdict, Bob Ewell feels that Atticus and the judge have made a fool out of him, and he vows revenge. He menaces Tom Robinson’s widow, tries to break into the judge’s house, and finally attacks Jem and Scout as they walk home from a Halloween party. Boo Radley intervenes, however, saving the children and stabbing Ewell fatally during the struggle. Boo carries the wounded Jem back to Atticus’s house, where the sheriff, in order to protect Boo, insists that Ewell tripped over a tree root and fell on his own knife. After sitting with Scout for a while, Boo disappears once more into the Radley house.  
Later, Scout feels as though she can finally imagine what life is like for Boo. He has become a human being to her at last. With this realization, Scout embraces her father’s advice to practice sympathy and understanding and demonstrates that her experiences with hatred and prejudice will not sully her faith in human goodness."
Family,"A Death in the Family opens with a young boy, Rufus, and his father, Jay, taking a trip to the movie theater together. They enjoy this time spent just between the two of them. On the way home, they stop by a pub so Jay can get a drink. After they return home, Rufus hears his father go out again.
Much later that night, at almost three in the morning, the telephone rings. It is Ralph, Jay's alcoholic brother. Ralph tells Jay that he had better come over soon because their father, Grampa Follet, has had another heart attack. Jay feels that the clearly drunk Ralph may be exaggerating. Nonetheless, Jay feels that he cannot afford to risk it, so he sets off in the Ford early in the morning. After crossing a nearby river on the ferry, he feels that he is driving into his rural ""home country.""
After Jay leaves, his wife, Mary, has trouble sleeping. She keeps thinking about her basic dislike of Jay's father, and then she begins praying for God to give her strength to like the old man. She also asks God to help Jay become a religious man, as religion is something she and her husband feel differently about. She feels religion is a rift between them in their marriage.
In the morning, Mary tells the children that Jay has gone to see Grampa and that he will be back by nightfall. Meanwhile, Jay has arrived at the farm and is now angry that he made the trip: sure enough, Ralph greatly exaggerated their father's condition. The night before, Ralph kept sneaking out of his father's sickroom to take drinks; he felt he was a failure as a man. He realized that nobody respects him because he is a weak person.
Hannah, Rufus's great-aunt, calls Mary and asks her if she can take Rufus shopping. After Rufus gets home from school, he goes over to his grandmother's house to meet Hannah. The two go shopping together, and the highlight of the trip for Rufus is when Hannah buys him a cap that he desperately wants.
At ten o'clock in the evening of the day that Jay is supposed to return home, Mary receives a phone call from a man who tells her that Jay has been in an accident and that she should send over a male member of the family. Mary immediately calls her brother, Andrew, and he and a family friend named Walter Starr drive out together. Before they leave, they drop off Aunt Hannah so that she can wait with Mary. The two women wait, tense and worried. Mary grows more and more alarmed as time passes.
Joel and Catherine, Mary's parents, are also waiting in their own house. Joel calls Mary to see if she has heard any news, but she has not. Joel is trying to read a magazine to distract him from thinking about what might have happened to Jay, and Catherine is trying to do embroidery.
Then Andrew returns to Mary's house. Mary guesses right away that Jay is dead, and Andrew confirms this fact. Shortly thereafter, Joel and Catherine arrive with Walter, who had gone directly to their house to get them. Joel takes Mary aside and gives her the best advice he can on how to cope with the death. He tells her to stay strong, and that he has confidence in her.
Joel and Mary return to the living room, where Hannah, Catherine, and Andrew are all assembled. Andrew tells them all what happened. He says that a cotter pin fell out of the steering mechanism of Jay's car, and that when he hit a rock in the road he lost control. His head was thrown forward onto the steering wheel, causing a concussion that was instantly fatal and likely painless. He then was thrown clear of the car. They all drink some whiskey.
Andrew calls Ralph to alert Jay's side of the family about the death. Ralph feels terrible, and offers to be the undertaker, but Mary has already brought Jay to a different undertaker. It occurs to Mary that Jay may have been drunk when he crashed the car; she immediately tells herself, however, that Andrew would have told her if that was even a possibility, and she puts the thought out of her head.
Suddenly, Hannah, Mary, Andrew, and Catherine all sense a presence in the room. Mary says that it is Jay. When the presence returns, she feels that it is in the children's room, and she goes upstairs to pray. Even Andrew, who is very skeptical about religion and all things supernatural, is shaken because he is sure he has sensed something. Mary comes downstairs again and asks Hannah to spend the night with her, which the older woman does.
When Rufus wakes up the next morning, the first thing he wants to do is to show his father his new cap. He runs into his parents' room, and his mother tells him to go get little Catherine, his sister, because there is something she has to tell both of them. She tells them that their father has died and that they will never be able to see him again. The children are upset, but do not fully understand the import of the news. At breakfast, Hannah tells them the details of the death and says they can ask her questions about anything.
That day, Rufus wanders around the house aimlessly, unsure of what to do with himself. Even though Hannah tells him to stay in the house, he sneaks out and goes to the sidewalk where kids walk to school. A bunch of them gather around him, and he tells them that his father is dead. One little boy relates the story as he read it in the local newspaper, adding gory details. Another boy says that his father said that Jay was drunk. Then the school bell rings, the boys run off, and Rufus goes home. He gets in an argument with little Catherine over her coloring book, and Aunt Hannah chastises him.
The next day, Hannah washes and dresses Rufus and little Catherine for the funeral. A priest named Father Jackson comes to the house and, after meanly reprimanding the children for staring at him, goes into Mary's room and prays with her and Hannah. The children eavesdrop at the door until Walter Starr arrives. He keeps them company in the sitting room until their mother and aunt emerge with Father Jackson.
The children go to the wake, which is held at their grandparents' house, and see their father for the last time. Back at home, little Catherine feels lonely. She looks for her mother and hides under a bed until Mary finds her. Andrew takes Rufus for a walk. He tells Rufus about a beautiful butterfly that he saw land on their father's coffin during the burial service. The story makes Rufus feel better about not being present at the funeral. Then Andrew gets angry with Father Jackson and tells Rufus that the priest refused to read the full burial service because Jay had never been baptized. As Rufus and Andrew walk home in silence, Rufus wonders if, since Andrew hates religion, he also hates the religious Mary and Hannah."
Learn,"Educated is primarily retrospective, consisting of Tara Westover's memories about her past. She tells the story of the events of her life from a vantage point in her late twenties, occasionally interjecting to comment on the process of trying to arrive at an accurate version of the past. Tara was born the youngest of seven children to parents whom she refers to as Faye and Gene (pseudonyms). The Westover family lived on a farm in rural Idaho, where Gene made a living salvaging scrap metal while Faye worked as an unlicensed midwife and herbal healer. Gene suffered from paranoid fears about interference from the federal government, and as a result he refused to allow his children to attend school, receive birth certificates, or receive medical attention. Gene was also a devout Mormon who believed in radical self-sufficiency and an impending Day of Judgement.
		
Shifts in the Westover family dynamic began to emerge when Tara was about nine. Her mother's work as a midwife increased her sense of independence, but after sustaining a serious and untreated brain injury in a car accident, Faye began to lose confidence in her skills, and focused instead on using herbal remedies and a form of intuitive healing. Around this time, Tyler (the third son) announced that he was going to attend college, which estranged him from his family. Tyler's absence forced Tara to become more involved in helping her father with his scrapping work, which left her constantly exposed to the possibility of dangerous injury. It also made her more curious about possibly pursuing an education herself. When Tara was ten, she told her disapproving father that she wanted to begin going to school, but nothing came of the idea.
As Tara grew into her teens, she acquired more independence from her family due to taking on various jobs and pursuing singing and musical theatre in the local community. However, her life was dominated by the strict rules and religious doctrine her father imposed, and Tara often worried about becoming sinful. When Tara was thirteen, her older brother Shawn moved back home. At first Shawn and Tara were close and spent a lot of time together. When Tara was about fifteen, however, Shawn began to be physically abusive toward her. His behavior only got worse after Shawn experienced a head injury. Tyler eventually realized that Shawn was hurting Tara, and he urged Tara to seriously consider applying to college and getting away from the family. Although she was uncertain at first, Tara began to study and was eventually accepted at Brigham Young University, having passed herself off as homeschooled.
In January 2004, when Tara was seventeen years old, she moved to Utah to begin her college education. She found the adjustment very difficult at first, but eventually began to excel in her studies. Tara's finances were precarious, and she had to hold multiple jobs and maintain very high grades to retain her scholarship. Her emerging independence also caused a threatening dynamic between her, Gene, and Shawn. Whenever Tara returned to Buck's Peak, her father manipulated her into working for him, while Shawn continued to physically and emotionally abuse her. Tara eventually confided to a bishop about her life, and he helped her to secure funding to finance her education. Tara's studies, and the people she met, also gradually opened her eyes to different realities and force her to realize how damaging and isolating her childhood has been. Tara eventually changed her major to studying history, and is encouraged to apply for a study abroad program at Cambridge University in England.
Tara's experience at Cambridge broadened her horizons even further, and she was encouraged to consider graduate studies. Tara still felt isolated from her peers, and ashamed of her origins. She hid most of her past even from her friends and the men she occasionally dated. She was eventually awarded a prestigious Cambridge Gates Fellowship and moved to England to pursue a Master's degree. She remained in close contact with her family and returned to Idaho regularly to visit, but her relationship with them deteriorated. Shawn was growing increasingly erratic and violent, and Tara feared for the safety of his wife and young child. By chance, she revealed to her sister Audrey that Shawn had been abusive with her, and Audrey later confided that Shawn abused her as well. Audrey blamed herself for not protecting her younger sister, and suggested that she and Tara confront their parents and Shawn about what happened to them.
By then Tara had built a happy life for herself in England, and was working on a PhD in history at Cambridge. However, the attempt to speak the truth quickly became a source of conflict in the family. Tara became more and more ostracized within her family, eventually culminating in Shawn learning that she had been telling their parents about the abuse she suffered. Realizing her family would never trust her claims, Tara became estranged from most of them, with the exception of Tyler.  The estrangement from her family prompted grief and depression for Tara, but she was finally able to heal, and successfully completed her PhD. By the end of her memoir, Tara has accepted that she may never have a relationship with her family again, but she takes pride in the independence she has established, and the life she has built for herself."
Answer,"As a huntress and her family’s primary source of survival, nineteen-year-old Feyre stalks the bleak woods, a little farther from home than usual. Her family was once very wealthy, but they now live in poverty. Feyre’s luck turns when she spots a deer. At the same time, an enormous wolf appears out of nowhere. Feyre wonders if the wolf is a faerie in disguise. She hates faeries for all the harm they have done to humans. Feyre decides to use a precious ash arrow, a surefire method to kill a faerie, just in case. She fires the arrow as the wolf attacks the deer, killing the beast. The next evening, a golden beast bursts through the door of her family’s rundown cottage. The beast reveals that the wolf was indeed a faerie named Andras. The beast demands payment for his death under the terms of the Treaty between the human and faerie realms. The beast gives Feyre a choice: he can kill her now, or she can follow him to the faerie realm of Prythian to live out the rest of her days. Feyre chooses to live. 
In Prythian, Feyre learns the golden beast is a High Fae called Tamlin. He is the High Lord of the Spring Court. Tamlin and all the faeries in his court wear permanent masks on their faces due to an affliction called the blight. At first, Feyre is determined to escape Prythian, but she soon becomes accustomed to her new home. She learns about its history and magic and that much of what she was raised to believe about faeries, including their inability to lie and their aversion to iron, are myths. Feyre develops an affection for Alis, her lady-in-waiting, and Lucien, Tamlin’s best friend. Tamlin encourages her to explore her love for painting and to improve her reading skills. He reveals that he has ensured her family is well cared for in the human realm. Romantic and sexual tension grows between them. Although Feyre finds Prythian beautiful, it is full of dangerous creatures and intrigue. The blight makes life in Prythian increasingly perilous. After a threatening visit from a High Fae named Rhysand, Tamlin believes Feyre is no longer safe in Prythian and decides to send her back to the human realm. The night before she leaves, they make love. Tamlin tells Feyre that he loves her. Though she loves him too, she cannot bring herself to speak the words aloud.  
Feyre returns to the human realm to find that Tamlin was true to his word. Her family is extremely wealthy and well cared for. Her father and sisters have been glamoured, or tricked with faerie magic, and know nothing about faeries or how their wealth was restored. They believe Feyre has been away caring for a sick aunt. Soon, her sister Nesta reveals the glamour did not work on her. After Feyre was taken to Prythian, Nesta searched for her but was unable to cross the wall between the human and faerie realms. Nesta also reveals she is still angry at their father for not trying harder to save their mother’s life. Nesta’s words inspire Feyre to fight harder for Tamlin and she sets off for Prythian to fight the blight alongside him.  
When Feyre arrives at the Spring Court, Tamlin’s manor house is in shambles. Alis is the only one left. Alis reveals that the blight is a euphemism that refers to Amarantha, the High Queen of Prythian. Amarantha is an interloper who took Prythian over by force. She stole the powers of the High Fae and placed a curse on Tamlin that could only be broken by a woman who hated the fae declaring her love for him. Since Feyre never told Tamlin she loved him, the curse remained. The curse prevented the faeries from telling Feyre the truth, so they used the blight to explain their masks and other conflicts. Alis can tell Feyre this because Amarantha has relaxed part of the curse, believing she’s already won, but there is still one aspect of the curse Alis cannot reveal. When Alis explains that Tamlin and Lucien are Amarantha’s captives, Feyre decides to go after them. 
Feyre journeys to Amarantha’s faerie court Under the Mountain, where she becomes a captive as well. Amarantha gives her the chance to save Tamlin by completing three tasks or by solving a riddle. For the first task, Feyre uses her hunting skills to escape a giant worm in a labyrinth. As the faeries place bets and watch in amusement, the only one to bet on Feyre is Rhysand. After, he heals her broken arm. In exchange, Feyre agrees to spend a week every month with him in the Night Court. For the second task, Feyre must successfully solve a puzzle and choose the right lever or she and Lucien will be impaled and crushed. She makes the correct choice with the aid of Rhysand’s voice in her head. In the meantime, Rhysand parades Feyre around as his escort at parties. 
For the third task, Feyre must stab three faeries in the heart with ash wood daggers. Despite her guilt, she knows it’s the only way to break the curse. She stabs the first two faeries, but when the hood is removed from the third one, it is Tamlin. At first, Feyre believes she must kill the man she loves until she remembers two conversations about Tamlin’s heart of stone. She believes this means Tamlin’s heart is literally made of stone so he cannot be harmed by the dagger. Knowing Amarantha wants Tamlin for herself and doesn’t want to see him killed, Feyre plunges the dagger into Tamlin’s chest. She is correct, but Amarantha refuses to break the curse based on a technicality. In a rage, Amarantha beats Feyre almost to death. Feyre finally realizes the answer to Amarantha’s riddle is the word love. She speaks the solution aloud and the curse breaks just as Feyre dies. With the curse broken, Tamlin and Rhysand join forces to destroy Amarantha. One by one, the six High Lords gift Feyre with healing light and immortality. Tamlin sets a bit of this golden light on her heart, resurrecting Feyre and transforming her into one of the High Fae. Feyre and Tamlin are finally free, but Feyre must reckon with her new life and the lives she took to bring them to this point."
Till,"Scout Finch lives with her brother, Jem, and their widowed father, Atticus, in the sleepy Alabama town of Maycomb. Maycomb is suffering through the Great Depression, but Atticus is a prominent lawyer and the Finch family is reasonably well off in comparison to the rest of society. One summer, Jem and Scout befriend a boy named Dill, who has come to live in their neighborhood for the summer, and the trio acts out stories together. Eventually, Dill becomes fascinated with the spooky house on their street called the Radley Place. The house is owned by Mr. Nathan Radley, whose brother, Arthur (nicknamed Boo), has lived there for years without venturing outside.
Scout goes to school for the first time that fall and detests it. She and Jem find gifts apparently left for them in a knothole of a tree on the Radley property. Dill returns the following summer, and he, Scout, and Jem begin to act out the story of Boo Radley. Atticus puts a stop to their antics, urging the children to try to see life from another person’s perspective before making judgments. But, on Dill’s last night in Maycomb for the summer, the three sneak onto the Radley property, where Nathan Radley shoots at them. Jem loses his pants in the ensuing escape. When he returns for them, he finds them mended and hung over the fence.
The next winter, Jem and Scout find more presents in the tree, presumably left by the mysterious Boo. Nathan Radley eventually plugs the knothole with cement. Shortly thereafter, a fire breaks out in another neighbor’s house, and during the fire someone slips a blanket on Scout’s shoulders as she watches the blaze. Convinced that Boo did it, Jem tells Atticus about the mended pants and the presents.
To the consternation of Maycomb’s racist white community, Atticus agrees to defend a Black man named Tom Robinson, who has been accused of raping a white woman. Because of Atticus’s decision, Jem and Scout are subjected to abuse from other children, even when they celebrate Christmas at the family compound on Finch’s Landing. Calpurnia, the Finches’ Black cook, takes them to the local Black church, where the warm and close-knit community largely embraces the children.
Atticus’s sister, Alexandra, comes to live with the Finches the next summer. Dill, who is supposed to live with his “new father” in another town, runs away and comes to Maycomb. Tom Robinson’s trial begins, and when the accused man is placed in the local jail, a mob gathers to lynch him. Atticus faces the mob down the night before the trial. Jem and Scout, who have sneaked out of the house, soon join him. Scout recognizes one of the men, and her polite questioning about his son shames him into dispersing the mob.
At the trial itself, the children sit in the “colored balcony” with the town’s Black citizens. Atticus provides clear evidence that the accusers, Mayella Ewell and her father, Bob, are lying: in fact, Mayella propositioned Tom Robinson, was caught by her father, and then accused Tom of rape to cover her shame and guilt. Atticus provides impressive evidence that the marks on Mayella’s face are from wounds that her father inflicted; upon discovering her with Tom, he called her a whore and beat her. Yet, despite the significant evidence pointing to Tom’s innocence, the all-white jury convicts him. The innocent Tom later tries to escape from prison and is shot to death. In the aftermath of the trial, Jem’s faith in justice is badly shaken, and he lapses into despondency and doubt.
Despite the verdict, Bob Ewell feels that Atticus and the judge have made a fool out of him, and he vows revenge. He menaces Tom Robinson’s widow, tries to break into the judge’s house, and finally attacks Jem and Scout as they walk home from a Halloween party. Boo Radley intervenes, however, saving the children and stabbing Ewell fatally during the struggle. Boo carries the wounded Jem back to Atticus’s house, where the sheriff, in order to protect Boo, insists that Ewell tripped over a tree root and fell on his own knife. After sitting with Scout for a while, Boo disappears once more into the Radley house.  
Later, Scout feels as though she can finally imagine what life is like for Boo. He has become a human being to her at last. With this realization, Scout embraces her father’s advice to practice sympathy and understanding and demonstrates that her experiences with hatred and prejudice will not sully her faith in human goodness."
Such,"The Bottom is a mostly Black community in Ohio, situated in the hills above the mostly white, wealthier community of Medallion. The Bottom first became a community when a master gave it to his former slave. This ""gift"" was in fact a trick: the master gave the former slave a poor stretch of hilly land, convincing the slave the land was worthwhile by claiming that because it was hilly, it was closer to heaven. The trick, though, led to the growth of a vibrant community. Now the community faces a new threat; wealthy whites have taken a liking to the land, and would like to destroy much of the town in order to build a golf course.
Shadrack, a resident of the Bottom, fought in WWI. He returns a shattered man, unable to accept the complexities of the world; he lives on the outskirts of town, attempting to create order in his life. One of his methods involves compartmentalizing his fear of death in a ritual he invents and names National Suicide Day. The town is at first wary of him and his ritual, then, over time, unthinkingly accepts him.
Meanwhile, the families of the children Nel and Sula are contrasted. Nel is the product of a family that believes deeply in social conventions; hers is a stable home, though some might characterize it as rigid. Nel is uncertain of the conventional life her mother, Helene, wants for her; these doubts are hammered home when she meets Rochelle, her grandmother and a former prostitute, the only unconventional woman in her family line. Sula's family is very different: she lives with her grandmother, Eva, and her mother, Hannah, both of whom are seen by the town as eccentric and loose. Their house also serves as a home for three informally adopted boys and a steady stream of borders.
Despite their differences, Sula and Nel become fiercely attached to each other during adolescence. However, a traumatic accident changes everything. One day, Sula playfully swings a neighborhood boy, Chicken Little, around by his hands. When she loses her grip, the boy falls into a nearby river and drowns. They never tell anyone about the accident even though they did not intend to harm the boy. The two girls begin to grow apart. One day, in an accident, Sula's mother's dress catches fire and she dies of the burns.
After high school, Nel chooses to marry and settles into the conventional role of wife and mother. Sula follows a wildly divergent path and lives a life of fierce independence and total disregard for social conventions. Shortly after Nel's wedding, Sula leaves the Bottom for a period of 10 years. She has many affairs, some with white men. However, she finds people following the same boring routines elsewhere, so she returns to the Bottom and to Nel.
Upon her return, the town regards Sula as the very personification of evil for her blatant disregard of social conventions. Their hatred in part rests upon Sula's interracial relationships, but is crystallized when Sula has an affair with Nel's husband, Jude, who subsequently abandons Nel. Ironically, the community's labeling of Sula as evil actually improves their own lives. Her presence in the community gives them the impetus to live harmoniously with one another. Nel breaks off her friendship with Sula. Just before Sula dies in 1940, they achieve a half-hearted reconciliation. With Sula's death, the harmony that had reigned in the town quickly dissolves.
In 1965, with the Bottom facing the prospect of the white golf course, Nel visits Eva in the nursing home. Eva accuses her of sharing the guilt for Chicken Little's death. Her accusation forces Nel to confront the unfairness of her judgment against Sula. Nel admits to herself that she had blamed his death entirely on Sula and set herself up as the ""good"" half of the relationship. Nel comes to realize that in the aftermath of Chicken Little's death she had too quickly clung to social convention in an effort to define herself as ""good."" Nel goes to the cemetery and mourns at Sula's grave, calling out Sula's name in sadness.
Sula is a novel about ambiguity. It questions and examines the terms ""good"" and ""evil,"" often demonstrating that the two often resemble one another. The novel addresses the confusing mysteries of human emotions and relationships, ultimately concluding that social conventions are inadequate as a foundation for living one's life. The novel tempts the reader to apply the diametrically opposed terms of ""good and evil,"" ""right and wrong"" to the characters and their actions, and yet simultaneously shows why it is necessary to resist such temptation. While exploring the ways in which people try to make meaning of lives filled with conflicts over race, gender, and simple idiosyncratic points of views, Sula resists easy answers, demonstrating the ambiguity, beauty, and terror of life, in both its triumphs and horrors."
Loans,"A Doll’s House opens on Christmas Eve. Nora Helmer enters her well-furnished living room—the setting of the entire play—carrying several packages. Torvald Helmer, Nora’s husband, comes out of his study when he hears her arrive. He greets her playfully and affectionately, but then chides her for spending so much money on Christmas gifts. Their conversation reveals that the Helmers have had to be careful with money for many years, but that Torvald has recently obtained a new position at the bank where he works that will afford them a more comfortable lifestyle.
Helene, the maid, announces that the Helmers’ dear friend Dr. Rank has come to visit. At the same time, another visitor has arrived, this one unknown. To Nora’s great surprise, Kristine Linde, a former school friend, comes into the room. The two have not seen each other for years, but Nora mentions having read that Mrs. Linde’s husband passed away a few years earlier. Mrs. Linde tells Nora that when her husband died, she was left with no money and no children. Nora tells Mrs. Linde about her first year of marriage to Torvald. She explains that they were very poor and both had to work long hours. Torvald became sick, she adds, and the couple had to travel to Italy so that Torvald could recover.
Nora inquires further about Mrs. Linde’s life, and Mrs. Linde explains that for years she had to care for her sick mother and her two younger brothers. She states that her mother has passed away, though, and that the brothers are too old to need her. Instead of feeling relief, Mrs. Linde says she feels empty because she has no occupation; she hopes that Torvald may be able to help her obtain employment. Nora promises to speak to Torvald and then reveals a great secret to Mrs. Linde—without Torvald’s knowledge, Nora illegally borrowed money for the trip that she and Torvald took to Italy; she told Torvald that the money had come from her father. For years, Nora reveals, she has worked and saved in secret, slowly repaying the debt, and soon it will be fully repaid.
Krogstad, a low-level employee at the bank where Torvald works, arrives and proceeds into Torvald’s study. Nora reacts uneasily to Krogstad’s presence, and Dr. Rank, coming out of the study, says Krogstad is “morally sick.” Once he has finished meeting with Krogstad, Torvald comes into the living room and says that he can probably hire Mrs. Linde at the bank. Dr. Rank, Torvald, and Mrs. Linde then depart, leaving Nora by herself. Nora’s children return with their nanny, Anne-Marie, and Nora plays with them until she notices Krogstad’s presence in the room. The two converse, and Krogstad is revealed to be the source of Nora’s secret loan.
Krogstad states that Torvald wants to fire him from his position at the bank and alludes to his own poor reputation. He asks Nora to use her influence to ensure that his position remains secure. When she refuses, Krogstad points out that he has in his possession a contract that contains Nora’s forgery of her father’s signature. Krogstad blackmails Nora, threatening to reveal her crime and to bring shame and disgrace on both Nora and her husband if she does not prevent Torvald from firing him. Krogstad leaves, and when Torvald returns, Nora tries to convince him not to fire Krogstad, but Torvald will hear nothing of it. He declares Krogstad an immoral man and states that he feels physically ill in the presence of such people.
Act Two opens on the following day, Christmas. Alone, Nora paces her living room, filled with anxiety. Mrs. Linde arrives and helps sew Nora’s costume for the ball that Nora will be attending at her neighbors’ home the following evening. Nora tells Mrs. Linde that Dr. Rank has a mortal illness that he inherited from his father. Nora’s suspicious behavior leads Mrs. Linde to guess that Dr. Rank is the source of Nora’s loan. Nora denies Mrs. Linde’s charge but refuses to reveal the source of her distress. Torvald arrives, and Nora again begs him to keep Krogstad employed at the bank, but again Torvald refuses. When Nora presses him, he admits that Krogstad’s moral behavior isn’t all that bothers him—he dislikes Krogstad’s overly familiar attitude. Torvald and Nora argue until Torvald sends the maid to deliver Krogstad’s letter of dismissal.
Torvald leaves. Dr. Rank arrives and tells Nora that he knows he is close to death. She attempts to cheer him up and begins to flirt with him. She seems to be preparing to ask him to intervene on her behalf in her struggle with Torvald. Suddenly, Dr. Rank reveals to Nora that he is in love with her. In light of this revelation, Nora refuses to ask Dr. Rank for anything.
Once Dr. Rank leaves, Krogstad arrives and demands an explanation for his dismissal. He wants respectability and has changed the terms of the blackmail: he now insists to Nora not only that he be rehired at the bank but that he be rehired in a higher position. He then puts a letter detailing Nora’s debt and forgery in the Helmers’ letterbox. In a panic, Nora tells Mrs. Linde everything, and Mrs. Linde instructs Nora to delay Torvald from opening the letter as long as possible while she goes to speak with Krogstad. In order to distract Torvald from the letterbox, Nora begins to practice the tarantella she will perform at that evening’s costume party. In her agitated emotional state, she dances wildly and violently, displeasing Torvald. Nora manages to make Torvald promise not to open his mail until after she performs at the party. Mrs. Linde soon returns and says that she has left Krogstad a note but that he will be gone until the following evening.
The next night, as the costume party takes place upstairs, Krogstad meets Mrs. Linde in the Helmers’ living room. Their conversation reveals that the two had once been deeply in love, but Mrs. Linde left Krogstad for a wealthier man who would enable her to support her family. She tells Krogstad that now that she is free of her own familial obligations and wishes to be with Krogstad and care for his children. Krogstad is overjoyed and says he will demand his letter back before Torvald can read it and learn Nora’s secret. Mrs. Linde, however, insists he leave the letter, because she believes both Torvald and Nora will be better off once the truth has been revealed.
Soon after Krogstad’s departure, Nora and Torvald enter, back from the costume ball. After saying goodnight to Mrs. Linde, Torvald tells Nora how desirable she looked as she danced. Dr. Rank, who was also at the party and has come to say goodnight, promptly interrupts Torvald’s advances on Nora. After Dr. Rank leaves, Torvald finds in his letterbox two of Dr. Rank’s visiting cards, each with a black cross above the name. Nora knows Dr. Rank’s cards constitute his announcement that he will soon die, and she informs Torvald of this fact. She then insists that Torvald read Krogstad’s letter.
Torvald reads the letter and is outraged. He calls Nora a hypocrite and a liar and complains that she has ruined his happiness. He declares that she will not be allowed to raise their children. Helene then brings in a letter. Torvald opens it and discovers that Krogstad has returned Nora’s contract (which contains the forged signature). Overjoyed, Torvald attempts to dismiss his past insults, but his harsh words have triggered something in Nora. She declares that despite their eight years of marriage, they do not understand one another. Torvald, Nora asserts, has treated her like a “doll” to be played with and admired. She decides to leave Torvald, declaring that she must “make sense of [her]self and everything around her.” She walks out, slamming the door behind her."
Built,"The story begins with the unnamed main character, simply referred to as “the man,” on the Yukon trail. He is in the middle of a cold and isolated setting. The ground is covered in snow, and it is −75 degrees F. The man is a newcomer to the Yukon and is traveling alone except for his dog. They are heading to a camp where the man will join his companions. The man thinks happily of the lunch he carries with him and looks forward to finding his friends that night. He is not concerned about the cold, even as ice has frozen his lips together. The dog, on the other hand, senses the danger in the extreme cold. It expects the man to find shelter or build a fire. The omniscient narrator also comments on the danger in the man’s narrow perspective and lack of understanding.
The man hikes along a frozen creek, noticing areas where water has run down into the ice, making pools that could get him very wet if he fell through. The man knows that wet feet would cause trouble and delay his journey, but he does not fully consider the danger of wet feet. Nonetheless, he is cautious as he walks along the ice. At one point, he forces his dog to go ahead over some dangerous ice and it falls through. The dog climbs out, and the water immediately freezes on its legs and paws. The dog bites the ice off, and the man helps it clear its paws.
By noon, the man is pleased with his progress. He sits down and tries to eat his lunch but is shocked to discover how numb his hands have become and that his mouth has frozen over too much for him to eat. He realizes that he should build a fire. The man remembers how “a man from Sulphur Creek” had warned him about the cold but he had dismissed the danger. He slowly builds a fire and eats lunch. After he smokes a pipe, he sets off again. The dog enjoys the warm fire and is reluctant to leave it. The dog’s instinct tells it that they should not travel in the cold but should find shelter. 
The man and the dog continue up the creek until the man falls in a pool, ending up soaked to his knees. He is angry, but not frightened. He must build a fire to dry out his socks and moccasins. Slowly, he builds a fire with grass, bark, and larger and larger sticks. The narrator explains that a man must warm up quickly if his feet are wet when the temperature is this low. The man knows this as well, since he has been told so by the old man on Sulphur Creek. Additionally, he has lost all feeling in his feet and his hands are going numb. Now that he has stopped walking, his blood itself feels the cold. He feels it sinking away from his hands, feet, and skin to hide from the cold. He is surprised by how quickly his hands grow numb, and his face freezes, but the man is confident in his growing fire. He plans to warm his moccasins and feet there. He thinks back to the old man on Sulphur Creek and laughs at his warning that no one should travel alone when it is that cold. He is confident that he has saved himself.
However, disaster strikes. The man has built his fire under a tree with branches covered with snow. When he pulls sticks free, he dislodges some of the snow. In a cascading effect, snow falls from all the branches down onto his fire. It puts the fire out. The man finally begins to realize that he is in real danger. He wonders if he should have had a companion on the trip who could have built a second fire, but he must try to build another fire himself. He makes a pile of dry grass, sticks, and branches in an open space. The dog watches anxiously, depending on the man to provide a fire. The man tries to find his piece of tree bark but can’t. He realizes that his feet are freezing and beats his hands until he has feeling enough to find his bark. He is jealous of the dog’s warm fur as he struggles to light a match. But his hands are too numb to pull off a match and he drops them all in the snow. He even tries to light one with his teeth, but he coughs and drops it in the snow.
The man becomes more desperate. He burns all seventy matches at once. He tries to light the tree bark and badly burns his hands. He finally lights the bark and tries to build up the fire, using his teeth as well as his hands. But he accidentally scatters the fire, and it goes out. The man sees the dog looking at him uneasily. He decides he must kill the dog and use its warm body to defrost his hands. He calls the dog, but the dog hears a strange, frightened tone in his voice and won’t obey. He crawls toward the dog, but it backs away. The man forces himself to stand up and this reassures the dog enough that the man can grab it with his arms because his hands are too frozen. He realizes that his hands are too frozen to kill the dog anyway. Even beating his hands for five minutes does not bring feeling back. 
The man knows now that his life is in danger. In terror, he runs up the creek bed with the dog following. He oscillates between hope that he can somehow run to the camp and the knowledge that he is too frozen to make it. He cannot even feel his feet as he runs. He falls and feels warm and comfortable, although he has lost feeling in his face as well. He is frightened by this and runs again but falls a second time. He is angered by the dog’s apparent warmth and yells at it, then runs again. This time he only makes it a hundred feet before he falls. At this point, the man accepts his coming death. He imagines himself as one of “the boys,” coming down the trail and finding his own body in the snow. In his mind, the man tells the old man in Sulphur Creek that he was right. He falls into a peaceful sleep as he freezes to death. The dog stays for a while, confused that he is sitting in the snow without making a fire. Eventually it realizes the man is dead and heads up the trail alone, in search of other humans who can provide food and warmth."
Green,"During a New Year’s Eve feast at King Arthur’s court, a strange figure, referred to only as the Green Knight, pays the court an unexpected visit. He challenges the group’s leader or any other brave representative to a game. The Green Knight says that he will allow whomever accepts the challenge to strike him with his own axe, on the condition that the challenger find him in exactly one year to receive a blow in return.
Stunned, Arthur hesitates to respond, but when the Green Knight mocks Arthur’s silence, the king steps forward to take the challenge. As soon as Arthur grips the Green Knight’s axe, Sir Gawain leaps up and asks to take the challenge himself. He takes hold of the axe and, in one deadly blow, cuts off the knight’s head. To the amazement of the court, the now-headless Green Knight picks up his severed head. Before riding away, the head reiterates the terms of the pact, reminding the young Gawain to seek him in a year and a day at the Green Chapel. After the Green Knight leaves, the company goes back to its festival, but Gawain is uneasy.
Time passes, and autumn arrives. On the Day of All Saints, Gawain prepares to leave Camelot and find the Green Knight. He puts on his best armor, mounts his horse, Gringolet, and starts off toward North Wales, traveling through the wilderness of northwest Britain. Gawain encounters all sorts of beasts, suffers from hunger and cold, and grows more desperate as the days pass. On Christmas Day, he prays to find a place to hear Mass, then looks up to see a castle shimmering in the distance. The lord of the castle welcomes Gawain warmly, introducing him to his lady and to the old woman who sits beside her. For sport, the host (whose name is later revealed to be Bertilak) strikes a deal with Gawain: the host will go out hunting with his men every day, and when he returns in the evening, he will exchange his winnings for anything Gawain has managed to acquire by staying behind at the castle. Gawain happily agrees to the pact, and goes to bed.
The first day, the lord hunts a herd of does, while Gawain sleeps late in his bedchambers. On the morning of the first day, the lord’s wife sneaks into Gawain’s chambers and attempts to seduce him. Gawain puts her off, but before she leaves she steals one kiss from him. That evening, when the host gives Gawain the venison he has captured, Gawain kisses him, since he has won one kiss from the lady. The second day, the lord hunts a wild boar. The lady again enters Gawain’s chambers, and this time she kisses Gawain twice. That evening Gawain gives the host the two kisses in exchange for the boar’s head.
The third day, the lord hunts a fox, and the lady kisses Gawain three times. She also asks him for a love token, such as a ring or a glove. Gawain refuses to give her anything and refuses to take anything from her, until the lady mentions her girdle. The green silk girdle she wears around her waist is no ordinary piece of cloth, the lady claims, but possesses the magical ability to protect the person who wears it from death. Intrigued, Gawain accepts the cloth, but when it comes time to exchange his winnings with the host, Gawain gives the three kisses but does not mention the lady’s green girdle. The host gives Gawain the fox skin he won that day, and they all go to bed happy, but weighed down with the fact that Gawain must leave for the Green Chapel the following morning to find the Green Knight.
New Year’s Day arrives, and Gawain dons his armor, including the girdle, then sets off with Gringolet to seek the Green Knight. A guide accompanies him out of the estate grounds. When they reach the border of the forest, the guide promises not to tell anyone if Gawain decides to give up the quest. Gawain refuses, determined to meet his fate head-on. Eventually, he comes to a kind of crevice in a rock, visible through the tall grasses. He hears the whirring of a grindstone, confirming his suspicion that this strange cavern is in fact the Green Chapel. Gawain calls out, and the Green Knight emerges to greet him. Intent on fulfilling the terms of the contract, Gawain presents his neck to the Green Knight, who proceeds to feign two blows. On the third feint, the Green Knight nicks Gawain’s neck, barely drawing blood. Angered, Gawain shouts that their contract has been met, but the Green Knight merely laughs.
The Green Knight reveals his name, Bertilak, and explains that he is the lord of the castle where Gawain recently stayed. Because Gawain did not honestly exchange all of his winnings on the third day, Bertilak drew blood on his third blow. Nevertheless, Gawain has proven himself a worthy knight, without equal in all the land. When Gawain questions Bertilak further, Bertilak explains that the old woman at the castle is really Morgan le Fay, Gawain’s aunt and King Arthur’s half sister. She sent the Green Knight on his original errand and used her magic to change Bertilak’s appearance. Relieved to be alive but extremely guilty about his sinful failure to tell the whole truth, Gawain wears the girdle on his arm as a reminder of his own failure. He returns to Arthur’s court, where all the knights join Gawain, wearing girdles on their arms to show their support."
Edifice,"In her study, taking a break from her work, Christine de Pizan picks up a slim volume someone has given her. Shocked by the author’s harsh and extreme portrayal of the immoral and inconstant nature of women, Christine is saddened by this state of affairs. A flash of light startles her, and three women, allegorical figures representing Reason, Rectitude, and Justice, appear to her. They tell her she is to build the City of Ladies and populate it with the noblest and most accomplished women the world has known. The city is to serve as a safeguard against the cruel accusations of men as well as a reminder of the true and laudable nature of women.
Lady Reason takes Christine to the Field of Letters, a fertile plain where the city is to be built, and encourages her to use her pen to start excavating the earth so they can lay the foundations that will support the City of Ladies. Reason narrates the lives of various women and the testament of their strength collectively helps to build the city’s firm support. Reason first tells of women who have distinguished themselves in the political and military realms, individuals who have judiciously ruled vast realms as well as defended those realms from insurgents and attacks from beyond their borders. Next, she discusses learned women, like Christine, who have developed their intellectual capacities. Collectively, these women of letters have helped shape Western history and culture. Finally, Reason relates tales that demonstrate the prudence that women possess. Having completed the foundation and the walls, Reason turns over the city’s completion to her two sisters.
Rectitude is the next to address Christine and help her, with the mortar of her words, to complete and enclose the palaces, mansions, and domiciles that will house the city’s residents. Rectitude begins by telling of ladies of vision and prophecy who, despite the fact that few heeded their predictions, accurately foresaw the shape of the future. Rectitude then focuses on the family unit, relaying tales of faithful daughters and pious wives whose dedication to and love of their relatives superseded all. Rectitude celebrates all the good and countless benefits women have brought to the world and argues that they should be given the same access to education that is extended to men. She then tackles the importance of chastity to women and the horror and repulsion of rape, which is often insidiously characterized as something that is actively sought by women or which affects them little. Men, she claims, are the fickle ones when compared to the steadfastness of most women, especially those in love. Rectitude concludes her narration with the assertion that it is integrity, honesty, and generosity that earn a woman distinction, and not her physical attractiveness. Having completed the city’s edifices and populated it with noble ladies, Rectitude turns the project over to her sister, Justice, for completion.
Justice is left with the task of putting on the city’s finishing touches. Through her tales of holy women, she completes the roofs and adds doorways and gates to the City of Ladies. Most importantly, she brings the Virgin Mary to the city to serve as its guide and queen. Justice tells of various women who have been martyred for their faith. Faced with worshiping false idols and renouncing their love of Jesus Christ, they never wavered in their love of the one god. Though their physical bodies were abused, tortured, and violated, their intangible, spiritual selves remained intact, unsullied, and as strong as ever. Most of these women would go on to be declared saints. They wished to remain virginal and pure and went to their deaths in defense of their principles. Some even witnessed the torture and deaths of their children before succumbing themselves. Justice tells of several women who lived disguised as men in monasteries so they could remain free of the undesired attentions of suitors and pursue their religious devotion unhindered.
Having completed the city, the three Virtues turn it over to Christine, who rejoices in all that they have accomplished. Christine speaks to all women and declares the City of Ladies a refuge where they can find respite and safety from the sexual aggression and cruel attacks by men. She reminds the inhabitants of this community of women to stay strong and true and to uphold the noble virtues that have made the construction of the city possible. The city serves as a testament to the power and unity of women and of their own high standards and unshakeable virtue."
Withdrew,"Charlie, the fifteen-year-old narrator of The Perks of Being a Wallflower, has just entered his freshman year of high school when the book begins. Charlie is the eponymous “wallflower.” He is quiet and withdrawn, but he is also extremely observant and thoughtful, always paying close attention to everything going on around him, even if he is only a silent witness. Charlie writes the entire book as a series of letters to an anonymous “friend.” The reader never learns who this “friend” is, and the “friend” never writes back. Each letter begins with the greeting “Dear friend” and ends “Love always, Charlie.” Because the recipient of the letters never writes back, the novel reads like a series of diary entries.
When the novel opens, Charlie is grappling with two major traumatic deaths of loved ones in his past. The most recent death occurred last spring, when his only friend from middle school committed suicide. When Charlie was seven, his beloved Aunt Helen was killed in a car crash on Christmas Eve, which is also Charlie’s birthday. Although Charlie is nervous about entering high school, he soon finds acceptance from two main sources. First, his English teacher, Bill Anderson, recognizes Charlie’s talent for literature, and he takes him under his wing, assigning him extra books to read and essays to write over the course of the year. Also, Charlie begins to participate more in events, and he becomes friends with Patrick and his stepsister, Sam, who integrate him into their friend group. Charlie develops an enormous crush on Sam, which he tells her about, but Sam treats him affectionately. Patrick, who is gay, is having a closeted relationship with Brad, the quarterback of the football team. Sam kisses Charlie so that his first kiss can be from someone who loves him.
As the school year progresses, Charlie begins to come out of his shell somewhat, but Charlie’s life, his family life, and his friends’ lives become more and more complicated. The holidays are always a difficult time for Charlie’s family, because they bring up memories of Aunt Helen’s death. This year is no exception. Even though Charlie finds some solace in reading and re-reading The Catcher in the Rye, he still struggles to cope with his depression and with flashbacks of his time with Aunt Helen. However, Charlie’s acceptance by his friend group helps him become more at peace with himself. As Charlie becomes more mature, his relationship with his sister also deepens. Charlie’s sister has an abusive boyfriend. Charlie tells Bill about the boyfriend, and Bill reports it to their parents, which makes his sister mad at Charlie. But when Charlie’s sister becomes pregnant, she decides to have an abortion, she trusts Charlie to drive her to the clinic.
After Charlie performs as Rocky in one of his friend group’s regular viewings of the film The Rocky Horror Picture Show, Mary Elizabeth, a smart, pretty senior in their friend group, starts dating Charlie. However, Mary Elizabeth is far more interested in Mary Elizabeth than in having a relationship. During a game of Truth or Dare, Charlie is dared to kiss the prettiest girl in the room, and he kisses Sam. Mary Elizabeth stalks out of the room in a rage. In solidarity, the rest of the group sides with Mary Elizabeth, and Patrick advises Charlie to stay away from everyone for a while until tempers cool down.
Brad’s abusive father discovers Patrick and Brad’s relationship, and Brad is sent to rehab. When Brad returns, he refuses to speak to Patrick. Patrick confronts Brad in the cafeteria, Brad makes a derogatory comment about Patrick’s homosexuality, and Brad’s football teammates beat up Patrick. Charlie jumps in and, in a whirlwind, breaks up the fight. His defense of Patrick wins back the respect of Sam and his friend group. Patrick is thoroughly depressed and he leans on Charlie for emotional support. Patrick gets drunk and kisses Charlie, but he apologizes, and Charlie understands that Patrick is lonely and doesn’t know how to handle it. Eventually, Patrick sees Brad kissing a strange man in the park, which helps Patrick pull himself together and move on.
At the end of the school year, Charlie becomes increasingly anxious as the prospect of all his senior friends moving away becomes more and more imminent. When Sam is packing to leave for her summer pre-college program, she and Charlie begin to make out and start to have sexual contact, but Charlie suddenly gets extremely uncomfortable. The sexual contact dredges up a repressed memory of his Aunt Helen molesting him as a child.
In an epilogue, Charlie writes a final letter to his “friend,” dated two months later, saying that his parents had found him naked in a catatonic state on the couch. They took him to a mental hospital, where Charlie eventually realizes that Aunt Helen had sexually abused him, but that he had repressed these memories. Charlie forgives the memory of his Aunt Helen, and the novel ends with Charlie writing that he is planning to stop writing letters and to start participating fully in his life."
Planted,"Simon Kelleher has a particular talent for uncovering the secrets of his fellow students at Bayview High School. He uses a gossip app he created called About That to spread these secrets as well as rumors and nasty comments about his peers.
One September afternoon, Simon and four other seniors find themselves in detention. Addy Prentiss, Bronwyn Rojas, and Cooper Clay are rarely mentioned on Simon’s app, but Nate Macauley, who is often in trouble and who sleeps with a lot of girls, appears frequently. A teacher, Mr. Avery, has given all five students detention for having their cell phones in class—phones which they all claim were planted. When a car crash occurs outside, Mr. Avery leaves to go make sure no one was hurt. Moments later, Simon takes a drink of water and collapses almost instantly. After a frantic search for an EpiPen comes up empty, Simon is taken away by paramedics and soon is later pronounced dead.
Addy and her boyfriend, Jake, are friends with Cooper and his girlfriend, Keely. Bronwyn, whom Nate has known since kindergarten, has been an overachiever ever since her younger sister, Maeve, survived leukemia. Speculation about Simon’s death quickly takes over Bayview High School as the police seem to be treating it as not having been an accident. The four students who were in detention with Simon are approached by the police when someone makes an online post claiming to be Simon’s murderer. The police also discover unpublished About That content queued up by Simon implying that Addy, Bronwyn, Cooper, and Nate each has a secret to hide. The police believe that each benefited from Simon’s death because that prevented these rumors from being posted.
Jake and Addy have been together since their freshman year, but Addy fears what will happen when Jake finds out that she had sex with someone else last year. That is her secret.
Although generally a top student, Bronwyn once stole chemistry exam answers off her teacher’s computer. She fears what will happen if this becomes public knowledge. The police also confront Bronwyn with an old About That post. Simon wrote a humiliating account of her sister Maeve’s first high school party and made light of her bout with cancer, which obviously angered Bronwyn.
Cooper is a pitcher with a bright future playing baseball, has a popular girlfriend, and is widely liked. The rumor Simon had queued up, that Cooper used steroids, is untrue. However, the police discover a file Simon had encrypted, containing another rumor about Cooper, and this one actually is true. Despite protests from Cooper’s lawyer, Cooper is pressured into revealing his secret to his family: he is gay, and he has been cheating on Keely with a guy named Kris. 
As the only member of the Bayview Four with a criminal record, Nate seems to be the leading suspect in Simon’s murder. Nate has always had feelings for Bronwyn, feelings that seem to be mutual as they grow closer during the investigation into Simon’s death. However, Nate worries that Bronwyn just sees him as a project she can manage. Nate was known to have used and sold drugs in the past, and Simon’s unpublished post alleges that he is doing so again—which is, in fact, true. But since Simon’s death and the events following it, Nate has walked away from selling and taking drugs—at least partly because he knows that Bronwyn deserves someone whose life is less complicated. 
When the police seem focused only on pinning Simon’s death on one or more of the “Bayview Four,” Maeve begins an investigation of Simon on her own, and shares what she finds with her sister Bronwyn. Maeve is able to access Simon’s About That admin page and she also looks into Simon’s past. Maeve discovers some unsettling information about Simon, including some terrible comments he wrote and posted after a nearby school shooting. In spite of their lawyers and parents discouraging the Bayview Four from speaking with each other, they agree to work together as the investigation intensifies. Aided by Ashton and Maeve, they continue to dig into Simon’s past. 
After Addy reaches out to Janae, Simon’s only friend, Janae starts spending time with Addy and Bronwyn. Addy finally confesses to Jake that she had cheated on him, and she is bullied and ostracized at school by her former friends—who, it turns out, were just Jake’s friends and not hers. However, she finds new freedom once she is outside Jake’s influence. After Cooper tells his parents about Kris, he confides in Addy, as well. Nate comes to Cooper’s defense when the school learns that Cooper is gay. By now, everyone’s secret is out, and each of the four is increasingly intent on finding Simon’s real killer so they can move forward with their lives.
For Addy and Cooper, the urgency briefly lessens when Nate is arrested. Acting on an anonymous tip, the police have discovered incriminating items in Nate’s possession, including Simon’s EpiPen and water bottle. Nate’s fingerprints don’t appear on any of the items, however. Bronwyn enlists Addy and Cooper to help clear Nate, as well as a pro bono lawyer named Eli Kleinfelter. Since she is deeply involved in the investigation, Bronwyn has been warned not to contact Eli, who has officially taken on Nate’s case, so she feeds Eli information through Ashton. When the Bayview Four discover that Simon hired someone to stage the car crash, they conclude that Simon orchestrated his own death. However, the group don’t believe that Simon acted alone. Simon must have had an accomplice: whoever has been posting anonymously about the case.
Jake soon becomes their prime suspect, which saddens Addy. Addy goes to Janae’s home, and Janae confirms that Simon did indeed orchestrate his own death. He used his knowledge about Addy’s infidelity to persuade Jake to help him, including planting the fake cell phones that led the group being assigned to detention. After Simon’s death, Jake wrote the anonymous posts and forced Janae to plant evidence that would implicate his ex-girlfriend Addy—or so Jake thought. In the end, Janae couldn’t bring herself frame Addy because Addy had been so kind to her after Simon’s death, so she framed Nate instead. The framing of Nate was a deception that the police were all too willing to accept as fact.
Confronted by Jake in her home, Janae tries to stand up to him and get him to admit to his role in the framing plot while Addy hides and records their conversation on her phone. But when Addy’s phone rings at this inopportune moment, she is chased from the house by Jake. Addy falls, hitting her head on a rock, and Jake begins to throttle her. Cooper suddenly appears just in time to pull Jake off Addy and save her life. The authorities are called, and Jake is taken into custody.
Addy recovers from Jake’s attack, Nate is released from jail, and the Bayview Four, now exonerated, move forward with their lives. Nate decides that Bronwyn is better off without him, but she Bronwyn is hurt by his coldness toward her. A few months later, members of the group gather to watch Bronwyn perform in a recital. Afterward, Nate surprises Bronwyn with an apology. So many good things in Nate’s life have been ruined, but he doesn’t want to lose Bronwyn. They agree to resume their relationship."
Disability,"Charlie Gordon, an intellectually disabled thirty-two-year-old man, is chosen by a team of scientists to undergo an experimental surgery designed to boost his intelligence. Alice Kinnian, Charlie’s teacher at the Beekman College Center for Retarded Adults, has recommended Charlie for the experiment because of his exceptional eagerness to learn. The directors of the experiment, Dr. Strauss and Professor Nemur, ask Charlie to keep a journal. The entire narrative of Flowers for Algernon is composed of the “progress reports” that Charlie writes.
Charlie works at Donner’s Bakery in New York City as a janitor and delivery boy. The other employees often taunt him and pick on him, but Charlie is unable to understand that he is the subject of mockery. He believes that his coworkers are good friends. After a battery of tests—including a maze-solving competition with a mouse named Algernon, who has already had the experimental surgery performed on him—Charlie undergoes the operation. He is initially disappointed that there is no immediate change in his intellect, but with work and help from Alice, he gradually improves his spelling and grammar. Charlie begins to read adult books, slowly at first, then voraciously, filling his brain with knowledge from many academic fields. He shocks the workers at the bakery by inventing a process designed to improve productivity. Charlie also begins to recover lost memories of his childhood, most of which involve his mother, Rose, who resented and often brutally punished Charlie for not being normal like other children.
As Charlie becomes more intelligent, he realizes that he is deeply attracted to Alice. She insists on keeping their relationship professional, but it is obvious that she shares Charlie’s attraction. When Charlie discovers that one of the bakery employees is stealing from Mr. Donner, he is uncertain what to do until Alice tells him to trust his heart. Delighted by the realization that he is capable of solving moral dilemmas on his own, Charlie confronts the worker and forces him to stop cheating Donner. Not long afterward, Charlie is let go from the bakery because the other workers are disturbed by the sudden change in him, and because Donner can see that Charlie no longer needs his charity. Charlie grows closer to Alice, though whenever the mood becomes too intimate, he experiences a sensation of panic and feels as if his old, intellectually disabled self is watching him. Charlie recovers memories of his mother beating him for the slightest sexual impulses, and he realizes that this past trauma is likely responsible for his inability to make love to Alice.
Dr. Strauss and Professor Nemur take Charlie and Algernon to a scientific convention in Chicago, where they are the star exhibits. Charlie has become frustrated by Nemur’s refusal to recognize his humanity. He feels that Nemur treats him like just another lab animal, even though it is disturbingly clear that Charlie’s scientific knowledge has advanced beyond Nemur’s. Charlie wreaks havoc at the convention by freeing Algernon from his cage while they are onstage. Charlie flees back to New York with Algernon and gets his own apartment, where the scientists cannot find him. He realizes that Nemur’s hypothesis contains an error and that there is a possibility that his intelligence gain will only be temporary.
Charlie meets his neighbor, an attractive, free-spirited artist named Fay Lillman. Charlie does not tell Fay about his past, and he is able to consummate a sexual relationship with her. The foundation that has funded the experiment gives Charlie dispensation to do his own research, so he returns to the lab. However, his commitment to his work begins to consume him, and he drifts away from Fay.
Algernon’s intelligence begins to slip, and his behavior becomes erratic. Charlie worries that whatever happens to Algernon will soon happen to him as well. Algernon eventually dies. Fearing a regression to his previous level of intelligence, Charlie visits his mother and sister in order to try to come to terms with his past. He finds the experience moving, thrilling, and devastating. Charlie’s mother, now a demented old woman, expresses pride in his accomplishments, and his sister is overjoyed to see him. However, Rose suddenly slips into a delusional flashback and attacks Charlie with a butcher knife. He leaves sobbing, but he feels that he has finally overcome his painful background and become a fully developed individual.
Charlie succeeds in finding the error in Nemur’s hypothesis, scientifically proving that a flaw in the operation will cause his intelligence to vanish as quickly as it has come. Charlie calls this phenomenon the “Algernon-Gordon Effect.” As he passes through a stage of average intelligence on his way back to a state of intellectual disability, Charlie enjoys a brief, passionate relationship with Alice, but he sends her away as he senses the return of his old self. When Charlie’s regression is complete, he briefly returns to his old job at the bakery, where his coworkers welcome him back with kindness.
Charlie forgets that he is no longer enrolled in Alice’s night-school class for intellectually disabled adults, and he upsets her by showing up. In fact, Charlie has forgotten their entire romantic relationship. Having decided to remove himself from the people who have known him and now feel sorry for him, he checks himself into a home for intellectually disabled adults. His last request is for the reader of his manuscript to leave fresh flowers on Algernon’s grave."
Marts,"Rashad and Quinn are both students at Springfield Central High School. They have some friends in common but have never interacted with each other. Rashad is Black, and his father has told him throughout his life about the importance of discipline for young Black men. Rashad’s father joined the army and then the police force before retiring and often tells Rashad that the army is the best opportunity for a Black man to succeed in the United States. Because of this, Rashad is part of the Reserve Officer Training Corps, or ROTC. However, Rashad would rather spend his time drawing and hanging out with his friends English, Shannon, and Carlos. 
Quinn is white, and his father died in Afghanistan. Quinn lives with his mother and his younger brother, Willy, and resents that people expect him to live up to the memory of his father. Quinn’s best friends are Dwyer and Guzzo, who lives across the street. Guzzo’s brother, Paul Galluzzo, is a police officer and has acted as a father figure to Quinn ever since Quinn’s father died. Quinn, Dwyer, and Guzzo are on the basketball team together, along with English.
One Friday, Rashad and Quinn are each planning on going to a party with their friends at Guzzo and Paul’s cousin Jill’s house. Quinn has a crush on Jill. On the way to the party, Rashad stops at Jerry’s Corner Mart to pick up some chips and gum. Jerry’s is always monitored by a police officer as a response to shoplifting incidents at the store. While Rashad is picking out chips, he goes to text his brother, Spoony. His phone is in his bag, so he puts it on the floor and kneels down to take the phone out. While he is kneeling, a woman who was standing behind him backs up and trips over him, causing them both to fall over and Rashad’s chips to slide up the aisle. 
The police officer on duty comes over and asks what happened but assumes Rashad was trying to steal before Rashad or the woman can explain. The police officer drags Rashad outside, handcuffs him, throws him to the ground, and begins beating him. Meanwhile, Quinn and his friends have been waiting in the alley next to Jerry’s to ask an adult to buy them beer that they can take to the party. When Quinn goes around to the front of Jerry’s, he sees what the police officer is doing to Rashad. He recognizes the police officer as Paul Galluzzo. He tells his friends to run and, when they are far enough away, explains what happened and tells Guzzo that he saw his brother. The three decide to go to the party and try to forget about it.
Over the weekend, Rashad wakes up in the hospital with a broken nose and ribs and is told he needs to stay there so the doctors can monitor his internal bleeding. Rashad’s father questions whether Rashad was presenting himself in a way that made him seem dangerous, while Spoony is outraged at the situation. The local news obtains footage of Paul beating Rashad and begins covering the story. The Galluzzo family decides to have a cookout on Sunday, which Quinn and Jill both find strange. Quinn and Jill talk at the cookout about what Paul did to Rashad, while Paul and Guzzo try to intimidate Quinn into not saying anything about what he saw.
At school that week, everyone is talking about what happened to Rashad. Quinn feels conflicted as he has only ever seen the good side of Paul and doesn’t know Rashad. On Tuesday, someone has painted graffiti on the sidewalk in front of the school that says, “Rashad is absent again today.” This message creates a division in the school between those who believe Rashad was innocent and those who believe Paul was just doing his job. When Rashad sees a picture of the graffiti, he knows it is Carlos’s work. 
Spoony and his girlfriend, Berry, plan a protest that coming Friday against the police department. Guzzo continues to question Quinn’s loyalty. At first, Quinn wants to believe that Paul was just trying to do his job, but he just can’t forget what he saw outside Jerry’s. On Thursday, Quinn wears a shirt to school that says, “I’m marching. Are you?” The coach of the basketball team tells the players not to go to the protest and tells Quinn he will call his mother to tell her about his shirt. Quinn’s mother confronts him about the protest, and Quinn says he is standing up for what he believes in, just as his father would have done.
The doctor releases Rashad from the hospital on Thursday, and Rashad plans on joining the protest the following day. On Friday morning, Rashad and Quinn both feel nervous about the protest. Quinn sees a tank-like police vehicle headed toward the school and worries about the protesters’ safety. However, after talking with Jill, he understands that Black people live in fear of police violence every day and that they should put themselves at risk for one day to speak out against this reality. Rashad and Quinn, along with an enormous crowd, march from Jerry’s Corner Mart to the police department, where they stage a die-in as Berry reads aloud the names of unarmed Black people killed by police officers. Rashad and Quinn notice each other during the die-in and feel a connection as they both think of the people on the list and how they will keep fighting for them."
Struggles,"Speak, by Laurie Halse Anderson, chronicles the struggles of thirteen-year-old Melinda Sordino after she is a raped by at a party the summer before her freshman year of high school by another student. Melinda tells her story in first person narrative. She describes events within the framework of the four marking periods of the school year.
In the opening part of Speak, “First Marking Period,” Melinda begins high school, and we learn that former friends now hate her. She experiences humiliation in the cafeteria and Mr. Neck, a social studies teacher, further embarrasses her by giving her demerits on the first day of school. Ostracized by her former friends, she befriends Heather, a new girl at the school. Heather seeks popularity, and she badgers Melinda to join various clubs. Rachel, Melinda’s ex-best friend, hasn’t tried to find out the truth about what really happened to Melinda that night at the party over the summer.
Melinda describes her classes, activities, and thoughts. Her project in Mr. Freeman’s art class is to create a work of art based on a “tree,” which is the object named on the piece of paper she randomly chooses. In biology, Melinda thinks that David Petrakis, her lab partner, might be cute without the braces. And in algebra, when Mr. Stetman has Rachel come to the board to help Melinda with a problem, Melinda is humiliated. 
Melinda often skips class using stolen late passes and doesn’t complete her homework. She finds refuge at school in a vacant janitor’s closet, which she turns into her “burrow.” At the Homecoming Rally, students bully her for being the one who called the cops that night at the party.
At home, Melinda and her parents communicate with each other by leaving notes on the refrigerator. In her bedroom, she no longer wants to look in the mirror and puts it in the back of her closet. Toward the end of the marking period, Melinda’s parents hear from the school about her missing work, and she remains silent while they berate her for failing. Through it all, Melinda sees “IT” everywhere, the nightmare from which she cannot awaken.
In “Second Marking Period,” school is a grind for Melinda. At her parents’ insistence, she stays after to finish her homework, but she goes to her burrow and naps instead. In social studies, David Petrakis stands up against Mr. Neck’s racist rant about immigration. In biology, she finds that a seed within the apple she has cut is already growing. Heather gives her an early Christmas present, and Melinda decides she’ll give Heather a friendship necklace. 
On Christmas, Melinda nearly tells her parents what happened that night last summer but can’t. Winter break is miserable. Her parents keep her busy working for them, and she is relieved when school starts again. 
In gym class, Melinda impresses the basketball coaches with skills but has no interest in being on the team. She reluctantly helps Heather in her attempts to become an initiated member of a do-good club. And in biology, when she and David dissect a frog, she faints when preparing to slice it open. 
Melinda’s parents receive another call from the guidance counselor about her grades. After their verbal assault, Melinda goes to her room and uses an open paper clip to scrape at her wrist. 
“IT”, who we learn is Andy Evans, harasses Melinda in the cafeteria, and she runs to the bathroom to vomit. She has yet to tell anyone, even the reader, about what happened that summer night.
In “Third Marking Period,” Melinda continues to skip school and avoid Andy Evans. Heather ends their friendship suddenly, and later returns the friendship necklace Melinda had given her for Christmas. No one, Melinda is sure, “would like the inside girl I think I am.” 
The school counselors hold another meeting with Melinda’s parents, who berate and threaten her. She refuses to talk or defend herself. She receives In-School Suspension, and IT is there. He sits next to her and blows in her ear when Mr. Neck isn’t looking. 
In art class, Mr. Freeman gives Melinda a book about Picasso to help her “paralyzed” imagination. Picasso’s art inspires her, and she begins to draw. Mr. Freeman recognizes that she has a lot to say.
Melinda works to meet the expectations set for her. Yet, with “no friends in the known universe,” Melinda sits alone at lunch, wondering if everyone is talking and laughing about her. 
One afternoon, after a basketball game, David Petrakis invites her to his house for pizza to celebrate the team’s one-point win. She declines, torn between getting a life, and the fact that the world is a dangerous place.
At last, Melinda reveals that she was attacked at a party last summer, though she does not use the word “rape.” At this point, we (the readers) are the only ones besides Melinda who know what happened.
In “Fourth Marking Period,” Melinda takes her ex-friend Ivy’s advice and tries drawing a tree instead of carving one from linoleum block. She also learns that Rachel is dating Andy Evans. Compelled to do something, she writes a note to Rachel warning her about Andy. In the note, she admits for the first time (but without divulging her identity), that she was raped. 
Springtime arrives, and Melinda finds solace working in the garden. She and David plan a protest in social studies class over an oral report she is supposed to present, and she stands up to Heather by refusing to help her decorate for the Senior Prom. She writes on a stall in the bathroom, “Guys to Stay Away From: Andy Evans.” Andy Evans continues to bully her. 
Melinda feels compelled to tell Rachel the truth about Andy and what happened that night. But, when Rachel learns that Andy Evans was Melinda’s attacker, she accuses Melinda of being jealous and calls her a “twisted little freak.” Later, Ivy brings Melinda into the bathroom stall. Other girls have added words like “creep” and “bastard” under Andy Evan’s name. Seeing that, Melinda feels like she can fly.
Melinda realizes she doesn’t need her burrow anymore. When she is clearing her items out of the closet, Andy Evans barges in, attacks Melinda, and tries to rape her again. She finds her voice and screams “NNNOOO!!” He does not back off, so Melinda breaks a mirror, takes a shard of glass, and holds it to his neck. “I said no,” she tells him. People who had heard her scream run for help.
With hours left in the school year, Melinda finds herself a sort of hero. She finishes her tree project, receiving an A+ from Mr. Freeman."
Placing,"A Small Place is divided into four loosely structured, untitled sections. The first section begins with Kincaid’s narration of the reader’s experiences and thoughts as a hypothetical tourist in Antigua. The reader, through Kincaid’s description, witnesses the great natural beauty of the island, while being sheltered from the harsher realities of the lives of those who must live there. Kincaid weaves into her narrative the sort of information that only an “insider” would know, such as the reason why the majority of the automobiles on the island are poorly running, expensive Japanese cars. Included in her guided tour are brief views of the mansions on the island, mostly gained through corruption or outright criminality. She also mentions the now-dilapidated library, still awaiting repairs after an earthquake ten years earlier. The tour continues at the hotel, and Kincaid concludes the section with a discussion of her view of the moral ugliness of being a tourist.
The second section deals with Kincaid’s memories of the “old” Antigua, the colonial possession of Great Britain. Kincaid recalls the casual racism of the times, and the subservience of Antigua to England and, especially, to English culture. She delves briefly into the history of Barclay’s Bank and discusses the Mill Reef Club, an elite, all-white enclave built by wealthy foreigners. She describes and deplores the great hoopla made over the visit of Princess Margaret to the island when Kincaid was a child. Much of the section is concerned with the distortions that colonialism has created in the minds of the Antiguans; Antiguans do not tend to recognize racism as such, says Kincaid, and the bad behavior of individual English people never seems to affect the general reverence for English culture. For Kincaid, the problem is compounded by the fact that the people of Antigua can express themselves only in the language of those who enslaved and oppressed them. She then discusses the connection she sees between the colonial past of the island and its impoverished, corrupt present.
The third section, the longest, deals with Antigua’s present and begins with Kincaid asking herself the disturbing question of whether, considering the state of the island today, things weren’t, in fact, better in the old days. As an example, she takes the state of the library, awaiting repairs after all these years and forced to reside in “temporary” quarters above a dry goods store. Kincaid has fond, if ambivalent, feelings toward the old library, which was a haven of beauty and an escape into reading for her as a child. She recalls the imperious ways of the head librarian (who suspected Kincaid, rightly, of stealing books), who is now sadly reduced to campaigning, mostly unsuccessfully, for funds to build a new library, while the collection decomposes in cardboard boxes.
The rich members of the Mill Reef Club have the funds to help, but will do so only if the old library is rebuilt—a demand that Kincaid sees as having more to do with nostalgia for the colonial regime than with a true desire to help. Kincaid mentions the ironies involved in Antigua having a Minister of Culture without having a culture to administer. She also mentions her politically active mother’s run-in with the current Minister of Culture, who has allowed the library to languish. Education has clearly suffered on Antigua in the years since independence, and Kincaid ruefully notes the poor speech habits of the younger Antiguans.
Kincaid discusses the way Antiguans experience the passage of time, and connects this to their oddly detached view of the corruption of their government. She then goes into a litany of the many abuses of power on the island, including misappropriation of funds, kickbacks, drug smuggling, and even political violence—all of which are known by the average Antiguan. Kincaid then discusses the political history of Antigua since independence, showing how power has rested in the same hands for most of the period, with one brief, unimpressive exception. Kincaid sees corruption as an ingrained element of political life on the island, so much so that government officials who do not steal are held in contempt as fools rather than admired for their honesty. She tells of the fears that many Antiguans have for the future and hints that open dictatorship or political upheaval may lie ahead.
The fourth, and final, section is a sort of coda to the piece, starting with an evocation of the intense physical beauty of the island. She describes the beauty as so extreme as to appear “unreal,” almost like an illustration or a stage-set. Kincaid says that the beauty of their surroundings is a mixed blessing to the Antiguans, who are trapped in an unchanging setting in which their poverty is part of the scenery. The slaves who were brought to Antigua by force were victims, and therefore noble—but their descendants, today’s Antiguans, are simple human beings, with all the problems and contradictions of human beings anywhere."
Eastward,"The Fellowship of the Ring is the first of three volumes in The Lord of the Rings, an epic set in the fictional world of Middle-earth. The Lord of the Rings is an entity named Sauron, the Dark Lord, who long ago lost the One Ring that contains much of his power. His overriding desire is to reclaim the Ring and use it to enslave all of Middle-earth. 
The story of The Lord of the Rings begins with several events that take place in The Hobbit. While wandering lost in a deep cave, Bilbo Baggins, a Hobbit—one of a small, kindly race about half the size of Men—stumbles upon a ring and takes it back with him to the Shire, the part of Middle-earth that is the Hobbits’ home. All Bilbo knows of his ring is that wearing it causes him to become invisible. He is unaware that it is the One Ring, and is therefore oblivious to its significance and to the fact that Sauron has been searching for it.

The Fellowship of the Ring opens with a party for Bilbo’s 111th birthday. Bilbo gives his ring to his heir, his cousin Frodo Baggins. When the time comes to part with the ring, however, Bilbo becomes strangely reluctant to do so. He gives up the ring only at the determined urging of his friend, Gandalf the Grey, a great Wizard. Gandalf suspects that the ring is indeed the One Ring of legend. After confirming his suspicions, he tells Frodo that the Ring must be taken away from the Shire, as Sauron’s power is growing once again.
Frodo sets out from the Shire with three of his Hobbit friends—Sam, Merry, and Pippin. Along the way, they are pursued by the nine Ringwraiths, servants of Sauron who take the form of terrifying Black Riders. The hobbits spend a night in the company of wandering Elves, who promise to send word ahead to friends who will protect the hobbits. Barely out of the Shire, the hobbits get lost in the Old Forest, where they have to be rescued from a malevolent willow tree, which swallows up Merry and Pippin, and then from an evil tomb ghost. The hobbits’ rescuer is Tom Bombadil, a strange, jovial entity with great powers who is the oldest creature in Middle-earth.
The hobbits make it to the town of Bree, where they meet Aragorn, a Ranger who roams the wilderness and who is the heir of the Kings of the ancient Men of Westernesse. Those who do not know Aragorn’s true name call him Strider. Frodo tries to keep a low profile at the inn in Bree, but he ends up causing a scene when while taking part in a rollicking rendition of a song he falls, accidentally slips the Ring onto his finger, and vanishes.
That night, Aragorn advises the hobbits not to sleep in their rooms at the inn. In doing so, he saves their lives—for the first of many times. A letter Gandalf left at the inn months before advises the group to head for Rivendell, a realm of the Elves. Aragorn sets out with the hobbits the next day, and with his help they avoid the Black Riders for some time. However, at the top of the hill Weathertop, the Company is forced to defend itself against the attacking Riders. Frodo is wounded during the skirmish.
Frodo’s wound, made by a weapon of a servant of Sauron, plagues the hobbit as the Company makes its way eastward. Aragorn is greatly concerned about the power the wound might exert over Frodo. Near Rivendell they meet the Elf-lord Glorfindel, who has been out looking for them. At the last ford before Rivendell, Frodo, riding Glorfindel’s horse, outruns the ambushing Black Riders, who are swept away in a flood created by Elrond, the master of Rivendell.
Elrond heals Frodo and then holds a meeting to discuss what to do about the Ring. During this Council, Frodo learns the full history of the Ring. Frodo accepts the burden of taking the Ring to the only place it can be destroyed—the place where it was forged. It promises to be a long, nearly impossible journey, as the Ring was forged in the Cracks of Doom, part of the fiery mountain Orodruin in the very heart of Sauron’s realm of Mordor.
At the end of the meeting, the Council creates a group to help Frodo in his quest. In addition to Frodo, the Fellowship of the Ring includes Sam, Merry, Pippin, Aragorn, Gandalf, an Elf named Legolas, a Dwarf named Gimli, and a Man from the south named Boromir.
The Fellowship heads south and attempts to pass over the Misty Mountains via the pass of Caradhras. Their way is blocked by snow and rock slides, and they are forced to divert their path through the Mines of Moria—the ancient, underground realm of the Dwarves. During the journey through Moria, Gandalf falls into the chasm of Khazad-dûm while protecting the Company from a Balrog, a terrible demon.
The rest of the party continues on to Lórien, the forest of the Galadrim Elves, where the Lady Galadriel tests their hearts and gives them gifts to help them on the quest. Frodo, spellbound by Galadriel’s power and wisdom, offers her the Ring. She refuses, however, saying that, despite her intentions, the Ring would corrupt her; ultimately, she would only replace Sauron.
Leaving Lórien, the Fellowship travels by boat down the Great River, Anduin. At night, they spot Gollum—a deformed creature that had once owned the Ring but then lost it to Bilbo Baggins in The Hobbit—following them. When they reach the Falls of Rauros, the Fellowship must decide whether to head toward Mordor on the east or toward the safety of the city of Minas Tirith to the west.
Boromir, overcome by the Ring’s power and desiring the Ring for himself, confronts Frodo. Frodo fends off Boromir and decides that he must go on to Mordor rather than to the safety of Minas Tirith. However, Frodo cannot bear the thought of imperiling his friends on the dangerous journey or allowing the Ring to corrupt them, so he attempts to leave secretly and continue the quest alone. Frodo does not, however, manage to elude Sam, so the two of them set out together for Mordor."
Ocean,"Shirin and her family are American Muslims. Her parents come from Iran, but she and her brother Navid were both born in the United States. Her parents move the family often in an ongoing effort to live in bigger homes in better neighborhoods to improve their opportunities for the future. As the story opens, Shirin and Navid are starting at a new high school for the third time in two years. Shirin is sixteen and a sophomore, while Navid, who is very protective of his sister, is a senior. A Very Wide Expanse of Sea tells Shirin’s story during that sophomore year.
A year has passed since 9/11, and because Shirin always wears a hijab, she is harassed and teased by other students. Once, just after the terrorist attacks, several boys attacked Shirin and choked her with her scarf. Because of the racism and prejudice Shirin has experienced throughout her life, she has developed a thick skin. At school, she talks to no one, looks at no one, and does her best to stay under the radar. She has a quick temper, however, and automatically assumes that anyone looking at her or talking to her has malicious or racist intent. Navid, who is far more outgoing than Shirin, starts a breakdancing team with his friends Jacobi, Carlos, and Bijan. He then invites Shirin to join them, which she does. They get a teacher to sponsor the activity, which means they get a room to practice in after school.
Shirin meets a boy named Ocean when they are partnered in biology class to dissect a cat. Because they still have to write a report, she gives him her phone number, and their friendship begins even if it gets off to a rocky start. As they get to know each other, Ocean expresses interest in Shirin’s family and her culture, and they begin texting and talking on the phone. Ocean and Shirin are also both in a class called Global Perspectives, which is taught by Mr. Jordan. When Mr. Jordan uses Shirin to illustrate a point about prejudice, Shirin gets upset and leaves class. Concerned, Ocean follows her, and the two sit at an IHOP and talk, feeling a mutual attraction. 
At lunch one day, Shirin meets a boy named Yusef, another Muslim, who is a senior. At practice, Jacobi tells Shirin that her constant anger is not healthy, which makes her question her defensiveness. Shirin attempts to drop Mr. Jordan’s class, but then he apologizes to her and asks her to return to class, which she does. Ocean tries to get to know her more, and one day they collide in the hallway and accidentally embrace. The physical contact exhilarates them both, and they soon admit their strong feelings for each other. Shirin believes that their relationship will not be good for either of them because of their fellow students’ bigotry. She tries to avoid Ocean, but she finds that she cannot. One day, they kiss in Ocean’s car during lunch, and other students see them. Word spreads quickly that they are a couple.
Shirin discovers that Ocean is a junior and a star basketball player on whom the school and varsity team depend to win championships. She realizes she had no idea what a big deal he was. Ocean confides in Shirin, telling her he doesn’t like playing basketball but doesn’t want to let down his mother, Coach Hart, the team, or the school. Ocean tells Shirin about his parents’ divorce and his mother’s inheritance. Ramadan arrives, and Shirin’s family begins their fasting, which Shirin likes but Navid hates. Shirin invites Ocean to attend a breakdancing event with her one Saturday night, and Navid gives them one hour alone afterward. During their time alone, Ocean takes Shirin to the park where he learned to play basketball. When Shirin expresses her concern for his unhappiness, Ocean feels moved by her compassion for him.
Ocean attends Thanksgiving dinner at Shirin’s house and falls in love with her family and the food. In her room, they kiss again, until Navid cuts their time alone short when he knocks on the door. Later, on the phone, Ocean admits that he is falling in love. As he and Shirin are both tired of hiding their relationship, Shirin agrees to let Ocean drive her to school. In the parking lot, someone calls her “Aladdin,” and someone else throws a cinnamon roll at her, which gets frosting all over her face and scarf. When she goes to the bathroom to wash up, a girl snaps a photo of her without her hijab on and posts it online for the entire school to see. 
Later, Navid and the other breakdancers attack the person who threw the roll. Someone posts a letter accusing Ocean of being a terrorist sympathizer because Shirin is his girlfriend. Coach Hart tells Ocean to stay away from Shirin, but Ocean refuses. Coach Hart then screams at Shirin for ruining Ocean’s life and jeopardizing his scholarship. Even Ocean’s mother, Linda, approaches Shirin and tries to talk her into breaking up with Ocean. Linda admits that she has spent Ocean’s college money, so he needs a basketball scholarship to continue his education. Ocean begs Shirin not to break up with him, but she wants to protect him, so she begins avoiding him completely. Ocean is heartbroken. After he sees her with Yusef, who has joined their breakdancing team, Ocean is suspended for fighting.
After Navid’s breakdancing team wins the school talent show, students begin to change their attitudes toward Shirin, and their hypocrisy angers her. One day, Ocean approaches her locker, and they share how much they miss each other. When Shirin returns to her locker after breakdancing practice, she realizes she never locked it. While nothing has been stolen, she notes that her journal has been moved from the bottom to the top, and she suspects Ocean read it. She feels upset by this idea but also grateful that he might now know her deep, true feelings for him. After Ocean gets suspended again—this time for breaking Coach Hart’s nose, he appears at Shirin’s house one morning, and they skip school together. 
Back at Ocean’s house, Ocean apologizes for reading Shirin’s journal, and they kiss again. When they embrace, Shirin notes that it feels like they have been drowning in a very large expanse of sea. Ocean’s mother hires a lawyer for his hearing. After the hearing, Ocean avoids getting expelled from school, but he quits the basketball team. Shirin and Ocean spend the last few months of the school year together and happy, but at the end of the year, Shirin’s family moves again. Ocean stands in the street and watches Shirin and her family drive away. When he is no longer in sight and just when Shirin feels her heart will break, Ocean texts her, “Don’t give up on me.” The story ends with Shirin stating, “And I never did.”"
Falling,"Okonkwo is a wealthy and respected warrior of the Umuofia clan, a lower Nigerian tribe that is part of a consortium of nine connected villages. He is haunted by the actions of Unoka, his cowardly and spendthrift father, who died in disrepute, leaving many village debts unsettled. In response, Okonkwo became a clansman, warrior, farmer, and family provider extraordinaire. He has a twelve-year-old son named Nwoye whom he finds lazy; Okonkwo worries that Nwoye will end up a failure like Unoka.
In a settlement with a neighboring tribe, Umuofia wins a virgin and a fifteen-year-old boy. Okonkwo takes charge of the boy, Ikemefuna, and finds an ideal son in him. Nwoye likewise forms a strong attachment to the newcomer. Despite his fondness for Ikemefuna and despite the fact that the boy begins to call him “father,” Okonkwo does not let himself show any affection for him.
During the Week of Peace, Okonkwo accuses his youngest wife, Ojiugo, of negligence. He severely beats her, breaking the peace of the sacred week. He makes some sacrifices to show his repentance, but he has shocked his community irreparably.
Ikemefuna stays with Okonkwo’s family for three years. Nwoye looks up to him as an older brother and, much to Okonkwo’s pleasure, develops a more masculine attitude. One day, the locusts come to Umuofia—they will come every year for seven years before disappearing for another generation. The village excitedly collects them because they are good to eat when cooked.
Ogbuefi Ezeudu, a respected village elder, informs Okonkwo in private that the Oracle has said that Ikemefuna must be killed. He tells Okonkwo that because Ikemefuna calls him “father,” Okonkwo should not take part in the boy’s death. Okonkwo lies to Ikemefuna, telling him that they must return him to his home village. Nwoye bursts into tears.
As he walks with the men of Umuofia, Ikemefuna thinks about seeing his mother. After several hours of walking, some of Okonkwo’s clansmen attack the boy with machetes. Ikemefuna runs to Okonkwo for help. But Okonkwo, who doesn’t wish to look weak in front of his fellow tribesmen, cuts the boy down despite the Oracle’s admonishment. When Okonkwo returns home, Nwoye deduces that his friend is dead.
Okonkwo sinks into a depression, neither able to sleep nor eat. He visits his friend Obierika and begins to feel revived a bit. Okonkwo’s daughter Ezinma falls ill, but she recovers after Okonkwo gathers leaves for her medicine.
The death of Ogbuefi Ezeudu is announced to the surrounding villages by means of the ekwe, a musical instrument. Okonkwo feels guilty because the last time Ezeudu visited him was to warn him against taking part in Ikemefuna’s death. At Ogbuefi Ezeudu’s large and elaborate funeral, the men beat drums and fire their guns. Tragedy compounds upon itself when Okonkwo’s gun explodes and kills Ogbuefi Ezeudu’s sixteen-year-old son.
Because killing a clansman is a crime against the earth goddess, Okonkwo must take his family into exile for seven years in order to atone. He gathers his most valuable belongings and takes his family to his mother’s natal village, Mbanta. The men from Ogbuefi Ezeudu’s quarter burn Okonkwo’s buildings and kill his animals to cleanse the village of his sin.
Okonkwo’s kinsmen, especially his uncle, Uchendu, receive him warmly. They help him build a new compound of huts and lend him yam seeds to start a farm. Although he is bitterly disappointed at his misfortune, Okonkwo reconciles himself to life in his motherland.
During the second year of Okonkwo’s exile, Obierika brings several bags of cowries (shells used as currency) that he has made by selling Okonkwo’s yams. Obierika plans to continue to do so until Okonkwo returns to the village. Obierika also brings the bad news that Abame, another village, has been destroyed by the white man.
Soon afterward, six missionaries travel to Mbanta. Through an interpreter named Mr. Kiaga, the missionaries’ leader, Mr. Brown, speaks to the villagers. He tells them that their gods are false and that worshipping more than one God is idolatrous. But the villagers do not understand how the Holy Trinity can be accepted as one God. Although his aim is to convert the residents of Umuofia to Christianity, Mr. Brown does not allow his followers to antagonize the clan.
Mr. Brown grows ill and is soon replaced by Reverend James Smith, an intolerant and strict man. The more zealous converts are relieved to be free of Mr. Brown’s policy of restraint. One such convert, Enoch, dares to unmask an egwugwu during the annual ceremony to honor the earth deity, an act equivalent to killing an ancestral spirit. The next day, the egwugwu burn Enoch’s compound and Reverend Smith’s church to the ground.
The District Commissioner is upset by the burning of the church and requests that the leaders of Umuofia meet with him. Once they are gathered, however, the leaders are handcuffed and thrown in jail, where they suffer insults and physical abuse.
After the prisoners are released, the clansmen hold a meeting, during which five court messengers approach and order the clansmen to desist. Expecting his fellow clan members to join him in uprising, Okonkwo kills their leader with his machete. When the crowd allows the other messengers to escape, Okonkwo realizes that his clan is not willing to go to war.
When the District Commissioner arrives at Okonkwo’s compound, he finds that Okonkwo has hanged himself. Obierika and his friends lead the commissioner to the body. Obierika explains that suicide is a grave sin; thus, according to custom, none of Okonkwo’s clansmen may touch his body. The commissioner, who is writing a book about Africa, believes that the story of Okonkwo’s rebellion and death will make for an interesting paragraph or two. He has already chosen the book’s title: The Pacification of the Primitive Tribes of the Lower Niger."
Crave,"A youth named Equality 7-2521, who has found a hidden tunnel and hides in it to write, knows his solitude violates all the laws of his society. Even though he does not feel guilt for his actions, he begs the forgiveness of the ruling Council. As he spends more time alone, he realizes that solitude suits him, and he begins to crave more and more time by himself. From his tunnel, Equality 7-2521 records episodes from his childhood. As a child, Equality 7-2521 wanted more than anything to be a scholar. He believed he was cursed with a terrific curiosity, which made him prefer some things to others and to prefer some people to others. He often fought with the boys at the Home of Students, and he was reprimanded by his teachers for being too smart and too tall. He tried to conform to the standard the others set, but no matter how hard he tried, he was smarter and quicker than they were. When the Council of Vocations assigned him to be a street sweeper instead of a scholar, he was pleased because it meant he could atone for the sins he had committed.
When he was ten, Equality 7-2521 saw the public execution of the Transgressor of the Unspeakable Word, who had discovered the word “I” and was burned to death in the town square as punishment for using the word. While he was burning, the Transgressor showed no pain but locked eyes with Equality 7-2521. Equality 7-2521 comes to believe that that moment anointed him as a disciple of the same crusade as the Transgressor.
Equality 7-2521 begins to conduct experiments and shortly discovers electricity. After many weeks of work, he successfully builds a lightbulb from the materials he finds in his tunnel. He decides that he must share his invention with the world and resolves to present it to the World Council of Scholars when it convenes that year in his city.
In the meantime, Equality 7-2521 has met the Golden One, a beautiful peasant girl who is proud and haughty. He knows it is wrong to do so, but he speaks to her when he gets the chance, and they immediately fall in love. One day, she offers him some water from her hands, and he drinks it, not understanding why this act makes him think of the Palace of Mating, where he and all other mature citizens are sent once a year to have sex.
Before he can show the lightbulb to the World Council, Equality 7-2521 accidentally returns late to the Home of the Street Sweepers, where he lives. When he refuses to tell his Home Council where he has been, he is thrown into the Palace of Corrective Detention. There he is tortured, but he still refuses to tell where he has been, because he wants to keep the lightbulb a secret until he gets to show it to the World Council. He remains incarcerated until the World Council convenes, when he breaks out of the Palace of Corrective Detention and goes to the World Council, expecting to be exonerated and reconciled with his brothers.
When Equality 7-2521 arrives and tells the World Council his story, however, the World Council rejects him out of fear and anger. It threatens to kill him and to get rid of his lightbulb. He cannot abide having his lightbulb destroyed, so he grabs his invention and flees the city. He runs to the Uncharted Forest where he discovers that he is free at last to do as he pleases.
A few days later, the Golden One appears. She has followed Equality 7-2521 into the woods. They vow to live together in peace and solitude. After they have been hiking for several days in the mountains, they find an abandoned house from the Unmentionable Times. The Golden One revels in the finery she finds in the house, and Equality 7-2521 consumes the library. He discovers the meaning of the word “I,” and he vows to protect his home and from there launch a new race of men who will believe in individualism and the never-ending supremacy of the ego."
Naval,"The setting is the last decade of the eighteenth century. The British naval warship H.M.S. Bellipotent impresses, or involuntarily recruits, the young sailor Billy Budd, extracting him from duty aboard the Rights-of-Man, a merchant ship. Billy’s commanding officer, Captain Graveling, though reluctant to let one of his best men go, has little choice in the face of the superior ship’s demands. Billy packs up his gear without so much as a protest and follows the boarding officer of the Bellipotent, Lieutenant Ratcliffe, across the gangway to his new assignment. After a cheery good-bye to his old mates, Billy settles in quickly among the company of the Bellipotent. He proves most industrious and eager in his role as foretopman and soon earns the affection of his more experienced fellow sailors.
	Billy is deeply affected by the sight of a violent lashing given to one of the ship’s crew. Hoping to avoid a similar punishment, Billy attempts to fulfill his duties in model fashion, but finds himself under constant scrutiny due to various minor infractions. Puzzled by this persecution, Billy seeks out the advice of the Dansker, an aged, experienced sailor. After explaining the situation to him, the Dansker concludes that Claggart, the master-at-arms, holds a grudge against Billy. Refusing to accept this theory, Billy dismisses the Dansker’s opinion but continues to wonder pensively about his situation.
	Shortly thereafter, at a lunchtime meal, Billy accidentally spills his soup pan in the ship’s dining room after a sudden lurch. The contents of the pan trickle to the feet of the passing Claggart, who makes an offhand, seemingly lighthearted remark in recognition of the spill. His comment elicits a stream of obligatory laughter from the ship’s company, and Billy interprets the event as proof of Claggart’s approval. But Claggart is offended by the accident, and finds it indicative of Billy’s contempt for him. He fixates on the accident as proof of Billy’s hostility, and his assistant Squeak resolves to increase his surreptitious persecutions of Billy in recompense.
	One night, an anonymous figure rouses Billy from his sleep on the upper deck and asks him to meet in a remote quarter of the ship. Confused, Billy mechanically obeys. At the mysterious rendezvous, Billy is puzzled when, after some vague discourse, the unidentified man flashes two guineas in exchange for a promise of cooperation. Without comprehending the exact details of this solicitation, Billy recognizes that something is amiss, and he raises his stuttering voice and threatens the man with uncharacteristic violence. The conspirator quickly slinks into the darkness, and Billy finds himself confronted with the curious inquiries of two fellow sailors. Unsure of how to explain the situation, Billy explains that he simply happened upon a fellow sailor who was in the wrong part of the ship, and chased the man back to his proper station with a gruff rebuke.
	Somewhat later, after a brief skirmish with an enemy frigate, Claggart approaches Captain Vere with news of a rumored mutiny and names Billy Budd as the ringleader of the rebellion. Vere summons Billy to his cabin and instructs Claggart to repeat his accusation. Upon hearing of this unexpected blot on his character, Billy is rendered speechless. Vere commands Billy to defend himself, but then, noticing Billy’s tendency to stutter, softens his approach. Left with no other means of defense, and twisted into a rage at Claggart’s outrageous words against him, Billy strikes out in a fury, giving Claggart a swift punch to the forehead.
	The blow proves forceful enough to knock Claggart unconscious, and he lies bleeding from the nose and ears as Billy and Vere attempt to revive him. Abandoning this effort, Vere dismisses Billy to a neighboring stateroom until further notice. The ship’s surgeon pronounces Claggart dead after a brief examination, and Captain Vere summons a group of his senior officers to the cabin.
	In a decisive move, Vere calls a drumhead court consisting of the captain of the marines, the first lieutenant, and the sailing master. Vere, functioning as the main witness, gives a testimony of the relevant events to the jury. Billy remains rather silent during his period of questioning, admitting to the blow but maintaining his innocence of intention and declaring his lack of affiliation with any potential mutiny. The court dismisses Billy again to the stateroom.
	During a tense period of deliberation, Vere hovers over the jury. When they seem to be deadlocked, unable to make a decision, Vere steps forward to declare his conviction that the rule of law must supersede the reservations of conscience. He concludes his speech to the jury by insisting that they decide to acquit or condemn in strict accordance with the letter of military law. After a period of further deliberation, the jury finds Billy Budd guilty as charged and sentences him to death by hanging on the following morning.
	Captain Vere communicates to Billy the news of his fate and, after a discussion with him that we do not learn about directly, he withdraws to leave the prisoner by himself. Later that evening, Vere calls a general meeting of the ship’s crew and explains the events of the day. Claggart receives an official burial at sea, and all hands prepare to bear witness to Billy’s hanging at dawn.
	Billy spends his final hours in chains on board an upper gun deck, guarded by a sentry. The ship’s chaplain attempts to spiritually prepare Billy for his death, but Billy already seems to be in a state of perfect peace and resignation. As the chaplain withdraws from Billy’s company, he kisses him gently on the cheek as a token of good will.
	That morning, shortly after four A.M., Billy is hanged in the mainyard of the ship. As the crew watches him being strung up, preparing to die, they hear him utter his last words: “God bless Captain Vere!” The assembled company automatically echoes this unexpected sentiment, and Billy expires with surprising calm as dawn breaks over the horizon.
	After Billy’s death, the crew begins to murmur, but the officers quickly disperse them to various tasks. Whistles blow and the ship returns to regular business. In the ensuing days, sailors engage in various discussions concerning Billy’s fate and the mysterious circumstances of his expiration. On its return voyage, the Bellipotent falls in with a French warship, the Athée, or Atheist. Captain Vere, wounded in the skirmish, eventually dies in a Gibraltar hospital, uttering as his last words, “Billy Budd, Billy Budd.”
	Finally, the legend of Billy Budd becomes recorded and institutionalized in naval circles. A newspaper reports the incident from afar, implicating Billy Budd as the villainous assailant of an innocent Claggart. The sailors themselves, however, begin to revere Billy’s growing legend, treating the spar from his gallows as a holy object, and composing laudatory verse in his memory."
Folks,"In this book, originally published in 1903, W. E. B. Du Bois has collected fourteen of his own essays about life after the Civil War, especially in the South. While the book predominantly deals with Black society and the life of “freedmen,” it also discusses how white society evolved after Emancipation. Throughout the text, Du Bois presents specific examples of racial injustice and inequality in the South. Before each essay, Du Bois includes a poem (or an excerpt from a poem or song) appropriate to the essay’s subject matter. Every inclusion is “a bar of the Sorrow Songs,—some echo of haunting melody from the only American music which welled up from the black souls in the dark past.” Du Bois revisits the significance of these inclusions at the end of the book.
While each essay examines a particular piece of the evolution of Black society, they are arranged to give the reader a historical perspective. Chapter I and Chapter II deal with the history and immediate impact of Emancipation, using historical examples and Du Bois’s own experience. Chapter III. specifically discusses the formation and responsibility of Black leadership, while criticizing Booker T. Washington on an academic level. Du Bois goes on to describe the Atlanta Compromise and the limitations it has placed on Black society in the South. Chapter IV through Chapter VII discuss the need for progress, and how it is blocked by lack of education and opportunity. He stresses that current systems produce mostly laborers, and that there is little room for Black upward mobility, especially in the South, due to a lack of education (and college-educated individuals). In Chapter VIII and Chapter IX, Du Bois describes visiting Dougherty County in rural Georgia. His first-hand experiences there are contrasted with his upbringing in New England, to show not only that there is greater disparity in the South, but also that many Black people in the South are not fully aware of it. In Chapter VI and Chapter VII, Du Bois draws on analogies to mythology to better explain the challenges he sees in the upbringing of Black men. In Chapter X., Du Bois examines the religion of the Black South. 
Chapters XI, XII, and XIII offer narrative examples of individuals Du Bois has encountered and events from Du Bois’s own life to illustrate the disparity between white and Black society. He discusses the death of his young son, pays tribute to a world-traveling preacher who remained undiscouraged, and recalls a student who had great potential but was a victim of his circumstances. Du Bois admits that these men are not well-known to history, but he considers their experiences are worthy of study. The final chapter, Chapter XIV, has several selections of “Sorrow Songs” that Du Bois describes as the “spiritual heritage of the nation.” He describes how the songs have been handed down, many from before slavery, and how they have become interconnected with religion and are still a centerpiece in Black society. 
Throughout the work, Du Bois uses historical fact and narrative example to establish how slavery and its aftereffects have shaped both Black and white society in the South. As a teacher, he then examines each situation academically. He presents cause and effect relationships and applies sociological analysis to them. The largest problem Du Bois discusses is the shortage of resources and opportunity for Black people at the beginning of the 20th century. He points out the effects of disparities in education and privilege and demonstrates the need for change."
Faint,"Irene Redfield is a light-skinned Black woman who, in public places, occasionally passes for white, when she finds it convenient. Irene is a practical, determined person. She was born and raised in Chicago but now lives in Harlem with her husband, Brian, and their two boys. Brian is a successful doctor but dislikes his work. He would have preferred to move the entire family to another, less racist country long ago, but Irene has always insisted that the family belongs in New York.
One day, while back in Chicago for a visit, Irene has a chance meeting with a childhood friend, Clare. Clare is very different from Irene—self-centered, melodramatic, and reckless. Clare is even lighter-skinned than Irene, and in fact she has married a white man, John Bellew, without telling him that she is Black. They have a daughter. The Bellews live mostly in Europe but often spend time in the Unites States, depending on where John Bellew’s work in international banking takes him. Irene finds Clare strangely fascinating but does not like her company. She only reluctantly agrees to visit Clare at the Bellews’ hotel suite. Clare has invited a mutual light-skinned friend of theirs to join them. When John Bellew arrives, Irene is shocked to learn that he is a vehement racist. He openly declares that he hates Black people, not knowing that he is speaking to three of them.
Two years later, the Bellews have relocated to New York. Clare resumes contact with Irene, and Irene is not firm enough to insist that Clare leave her alone, if only to keep Clare’s secret safe. When Clare learns that Irene is planning a charity event at which upper-class Black people and white people will mingle, Clare insists on attending. Soon, she is at the Redfields’ home regularly and has become part of their social circle. In time, Irene suspects that Clare and Brian are having an affair. The Bellews are due to move back to Europe soon, but a chance downtown encounter between John Bellew and Irene, while Irene is with a darker-skinned friend, creates a crisis. If Bellew deduces that Clare, like Irene, is Black, he may divorce Clare and leave her free to pursue Brian.
The threat that Clare poses for Irene’s marriage and family life is unexpectedly removed when Bellew tracks Clare down at an all-Black party hosted by friends of the Redfields in their apartment atop a high residential building. Bellew angrily confronts Clare, but Clare smiles and acts unconcerned. When Irene angrily moves toward Clare and puts her hand on Clare’s arm, Clare tumbles out a nearby open window, to her death. The cause of her fall is unclear—whether she fainted and fell by accident, or fell deliberately. It is also possible that Irene pushed Clare, but no one accuses her."
Shrinks,"Alice sits on a riverbank on a warm summer day, drowsily reading over her sister’s shoulder, when she catches sight of a White Rabbit in a waistcoat running by her. The White Rabbit pulls out a pocket watch, exclaims that he is late, and pops down a rabbit hole. Alice follows the White Rabbit down the hole and comes upon a great hallway lined with doors. She finds a small door that she opens using a key she discovers on a nearby table. Through the door, she sees a beautiful garden, and Alice begins to cry when she realizes she cannot fit through the door. She finds a bottle marked “DRINK ME” and downs the contents. She shrinks down to the right size to enter the door but cannot enter since she has left the key on the tabletop above her head. Alice discovers a cake marked “EAT ME” which causes her to grow to an inordinately large height. Still unable to enter the garden, Alice begins to cry again, and her giant tears form a pool at her feet. As she cries, Alice shrinks and falls into the pool of tears. The pool of tears becomes a sea, and as she treads water she meets a Mouse. The Mouse accompanies Alice to shore, where a number of animals stand gathered on a bank. After a “Caucus Race,” Alice scares the animals away with tales of her cat, Dinah, and finds herself alone again.
Alice meets the White Rabbit again, who mistakes her for a servant and sends her off to fetch his things. While in the White Rabbit’s house, Alice drinks an unmarked bottle of liquid and grows to the size of the room. The White Rabbit returns to his house, fuming at the now-giant Alice, but she swats him and his servants away with her giant hand. The animals outside try to get her out of the house by throwing rocks at her, which inexplicably transform into cakes when they land in the house. Alice eats one of the cakes, which causes her to shrink to a small size. She wanders off into the forest, where she meets a Caterpillar sitting on a mushroom and smoking a hookah (i.e., a water pipe). The Caterpillar and Alice get into an argument, but before the Caterpillar crawls away in disgust, he tells Alice that different parts of the mushroom will make her grow or shrink. Alice tastes a part of the mushroom, and her neck stretches above the trees. A pigeon sees her and attacks, deeming her a serpent hungry for pigeon eggs.
Alice eats another part of the mushroom and shrinks down to a normal height. She wanders until she comes across the house of the Duchess. She enters and finds the Duchess, who is nursing a squealing baby, as well as a grinning Cheshire Cat, and a Cook who tosses massive amounts of pepper into a cauldron of soup. The Duchess behaves rudely to Alice and then departs to prepare for a croquet game with the Queen. As she leaves, the Duchess hands Alice the baby, which Alice discovers is a pig. Alice lets the pig go and reenters the forest, where she meets the Cheshire Cat again. The Cheshire Cat explains to Alice that everyone in Wonderland is mad, including Alice herself. The Cheshire Cat gives directions to the March Hare’s house and fades away to nothing but a floating grin.
Alice travels to the March Hare’s house to find the March Hare, the Mad Hatter, and the Dormouse having tea together. Treated rudely by all three, Alice stands by the tea party, uninvited. She learns that they have wronged Time and are trapped in perpetual tea-time. After a final discourtesy, Alice leaves and journeys through the forest. She finds a tree with a door in its side, and travels through it to find herself back in the great hall. She takes the key and uses the mushroom to shrink down and enter the garden.
After saving several gardeners from the temper of the Queen of Hearts, Alice joins the Queen in a strange game of croquet. The croquet ground is hilly, the mallets and balls are live flamingos and hedgehogs, and the Queen tears about, frantically calling for the other player’s executions. Amidst this madness, Alice bumps into the Cheshire Cat again, who asks her how she is doing. The King of Hearts interrupts their conversation and attempts to bully the Cheshire Cat, who impudently dismisses the King. The King takes offense and arranges for the Cheshire Cat’s execution, but since the Cheshire Cat is now only a head floating in midair, no one can agree on how to behead it.
The Duchess approaches Alice and attempts to befriend her, but the Duchess makes Alice feel uneasy. The Queen of Hearts chases the Duchess off and tells Alice that she must visit the Mock Turtle to hear his story. The Queen of Hearts sends Alice with the Gryphon as her escort to meet the Mock Turtle. Alice shares her strange experiences with the Mock Turtle and the Gryphon, who listen sympathetically and comment on the strangeness of her adventures. After listening to the Mock Turtle’s story, they hear an announcement that a trial is about to begin, and the Gryphon brings Alice back to the croquet ground.
The Knave of Hearts stands trial for stealing the Queen’s tarts. The King of Hearts leads the proceedings, and various witnesses approach the stand to give evidence. The Mad Hatter and the Cook both give their testimony, but none of it makes any sense. The White Rabbit, acting as a herald, calls Alice to the witness stand. The King goes nowhere with his line of questioning, but takes encouragement when the White Rabbit provides new evidence in the form of a letter written by the Knave. The letter turns out to be a poem, which the King interprets as an admission of guilt on the part of the Knave. Alice believes the note to be nonsense and protests the King’s interpretation. The Queen becomes furious with Alice and orders her beheading, but Alice grows to a huge size and knocks over the Queen’s army of playing cards. 
All of a sudden, Alice finds herself awake on her sister’s lap, back at the riverbank. She tells her sister about her dream and goes inside for tea as her sister ponders Alice’s adventures."
Carry,"The protagonist, who is named Tim O’Brien, begins by describing an event that occurred in the middle of his Vietnam experience. “The Things They Carried” catalogs the variety of things his fellow soldiers in the Alpha Company brought on their missions. Several of these things are intangible, including guilt and fear, while others are specific physical objects, including matches, morphine, M-16 rifles, and M&M’s candy.
Throughout the collection, the same characters reappear in various stories. The first member of the Alpha Company to die is Ted Lavender, a “grunt,” or low-ranking soldier, who deals with his anxiety about the war by taking tranquilizers and smoking marijuana. Lavender is shot in the head on his way back from going to the bathroom, and his superior, Lieutenant Jimmy Cross, blames himself for the tragedy. When Lavender is shot, Cross is distracting himself with thoughts of Martha, a college crush. It is revealed in “Love” that Cross’s feelings for Martha, whom he dated once before leaving for Vietnam, were never reciprocated, and that even twenty years after the war, his guilt over Lavender’s death remains.
In “On the Rainy River,” the narrator, O’Brien, explains the series of events that led him to Vietnam in the first place. He receives his draft notice in June of 1968, and his feelings of confusion drive him north to the Canadian border, which he contemplates crossing so that he will not be forced to fight in a war in which he doesn’t believe. Sitting in a rowboat with the proprietor of the Tip Top Lodge, where he stays, O’Brien decides that his guilt about avoiding the war and fear of disappointing his family are more important than his political convictions. He soon leaves, going first back home to Worthington, Minnesota and later to Vietnam.
In addition to Ted Lavender, a few other members of the Alpha Company are killed during their mission overseas, including Curt Lemon, who is killed when he steps on a rigged mortar round. Though O’Brien is not close to Lemon, in “The Dentist,” he tells a story of how Lemon, who faints before a routine checkup with an army-issued dentist, tries to save face by insisting that a perfectly good tooth be pulled. Lee Strunk, another member of the company, dies from injuries he sustains by stepping on a landmine. In “Friends,” O’Brien remembers that before Strunk was fatally hurt, Strunk and Dave Jensen had made a pact that if either man were irreparably harmed, the other man would see that he was quickly killed. However, when Strunk is actually hurt, he begs Jensen to spare him, and Jensen complies. Instead of being upset by the news of his friend’s swift death en route to treatment, Jensen is relieved.
The death that receives the most attention in The Things They Carried is that of Kiowa, a much-loved member of the Alpha Company and one of O’Brien’s closest friends. In “Speaking of Courage,” the story of Kiowa’s death is relayed in retrospect through the memory of Norman Bowker, years after the war. As Bowker drives around a lake in his Iowa hometown, he thinks that he failed to save Kiowa, who was killed when a mortar round hit and caused him to sink headfirst into a marshy field. O’Brien realizes that he has dealt with his guilt over Kiowa’s death differently than Norman Bowker in “Notes.” Just before the end of the war, O’Brien receives a long letter from Bowker that says he hasn’t found a way to make life meaningful after the war. O’Brien resolves to tell Bowker’s story, and the story of Kiowa’s death, in order to negotiate his own feelings of guilt and hollowness.
Like “Love” and “Notes,” several of O’Brien’s stories are told from a perspective twenty years after the Vietnam War, when he is a forty-three-year-old writer living in Massachusetts. Exposure to the guilt of old friends like Jimmy Cross and Norman Bowker prompts him to write stories in order to understand what they were going through. But two stories, “The Man I Killed” and “Ambush,” are written so that O’Brien can confront his own guilt over killing a man with a grenade outside the village of My Khe. In “The Man I Killed,” O’Brien imagines the life of his victim, from his childhood to the way things would have turned out for him had O’Brien not spotted him on a path and thrown a grenade at his feet. In “Ambush,” O’Brien imagines how he might relay the story of the man he killed to his nine-year-old daughter, Kathleen. In this second story, O’Brien provides more details of the actual killing—including the sound of the grenade and his own feelings—and explains that even well after the fact, he hasn’t finished sorting out the experience.
In the last story, “The Lives of the Dead,” O’Brien gives another twist to his contention that stories have the power to save people. In the stories of Curt Lemon and Kiowa, O’Brien explains that his imagination allowed him to grapple successfully with his guilt and confusion over the death of his fourth-grade first love, Linda."
Indo,"Sophie Amundsen is fourteen years old when the book begins, living in Norway. She begins a strange correspondence course in philosophy. Every day, a letter comes to her mailbox that contains a few questions and then later in the day a package comes with some typed pages describing the ideas of a philosopher who dealt with the issues raised by the questions. Although at first she does not know, later on Sophie learns that Alberto Knox is the name of the philosopher who is teaching her. He sends her packages via his dog Hermes. Alberto first tells Sophie that philosophy is extremely relevant to life and that if we do not question and ponder our very existence we are not really living. Then he proceeds to go through the history of western philosophy. Alberto teaches Sophie about the ancient myths that people had in the days before they tried to come up with natural explanations for the processes in the world. Then she learns about the natural philosophers who were concerned with change. Next Alberto describes Democritus and the theory of indivisible atoms underlying all of nature as well as the concept of fate.
At the same time as she takes the philosophy course, Sophie receives a strange postcard sent to Hilde Møller Knag, care of Sophie. The postcard is from Hilde's father and wishes Hilde happy birthday. Sophie is confused, and moreso when she finds a scarf with Hilde's name on it. She does not know what is happening but she is sure that Hilde and the philosophy course must somehow be connected. She learns about Socrates, who was wise enough to know that he knew nothing. Then Alberto sends her a video that shows him in present day Athens and somehow he seems to go back in time to ancient Athens. She learns about Plato and his world of ideas and then about Aristotle, who critiqued Plato, classified much of the natural world, and founded logic and our theory of concepts.
Then, as Sophie's education continues, the Hilde situation begins to get more complicated. She finds many more postcards to Hilde, and some of them are even dated on June 15, the day of Sophie will turn 15. The problem is that June 15 is still over a month away. She discovers some of this with her best friend Joanna, and one of the postcards tells Hilde that one day she will meet Sophie and also mentions Joanna. Strange things are happening that the girls cannot figure out. Sophie's relationship with her mother becomes somewhat strained as she tries both to cover up the correspondence with Alberto and to practice her philosophical thinking on her mom. Meanwhile, Alberto teaches Sophie about Jesus and the meeting of Indo-European and Semitic culture. She learns about St. Augustine, St. Aquinas, and the christianization of Greek philosophy that occurred in the Middle Ages. By this time, Sophie has met Alberto and he begins hinting that the philosophy is about to get extremely relevant to the strange things that are happening to her.
Sophie learns about the focus on humanity in the Renaissance and the extremes of the Baroque and then Alberto focuses on some key philosophers. Urgently, he teaches her about Descartes, who doubted, and by doing so knew at least that he could doubt. They move on to Spinoza as it becomes clear that Hilde's father has some awesome power over them. Then Sophie learns about the empiricists. Locke believed in natural rights and that everything we know is gained from experience. Hume, an important influence on Kant, showed that our actions are guided by feelings and warned against making laws based upon our experiences. But Berkeley is most important to Sophie because he suggested that perhaps our entire lives were inside the mind of God. And Alberto says that their lives are inside the mind of Albert Knag, Hilde's father.
At this point the story switches to Hilde's point of view. On June 15, the day she turns fifteen, Hilde receives a birthday gift from her father entitled Sophie's World. She begins to read and is enthralled. We follow the rest of Sophie's story from Hilde's perspective. Hilde becomes certain that Sophie exists, that she is not just a character in a book. Alberto has a plan to escape Albert Knag's mind, and they must finish the philosophy course before that can happen. He teaches Sophie about the Enlightenment and its humane values and about Kant and his unification of empiricist and rationalist thought. Things in Sophie's life have become completely insane but she and Alberto know they must figure out a way to do something. It will have to occur on the night of June 15, when Hilde's father returns home. They learn about the world spirit of Romanticism, Hegel's dialectical view of history, and Kierkegaard's belief that the individual's existence is primary. Meanwhile, Hilde plans a surprise for her father on his return home. They rush through Marx, Darwin, Freud, and Sartre, desperate to come up with a plan to escape even though everything they do is known by Hilde's father. Then at the end of Sophie's World, the book that Hilde is reading, while at a party for Sophie on June 15, Alberto and Sophie disappear. Hilde's father comes home and they talk about the book, and Hilde is sure that Sophie exists somewhere. Meanwhile, Sophie and Alberto have a new existence as spirit—they have escaped from Albert Knag's mind but they are invisible to other people and can walk right through them. Sophie wants to try to interfere in the world of Hilde and her father, and at the end of the book she is learning how to do so."
Communicate,"Speak, by Laurie Halse Anderson, chronicles the struggles of thirteen-year-old Melinda Sordino after she is a raped by at a party the summer before her freshman year of high school by another student. Melinda tells her story in first person narrative. She describes events within the framework of the four marking periods of the school year.
In the opening part of Speak, “First Marking Period,” Melinda begins high school, and we learn that former friends now hate her. She experiences humiliation in the cafeteria and Mr. Neck, a social studies teacher, further embarrasses her by giving her demerits on the first day of school. Ostracized by her former friends, she befriends Heather, a new girl at the school. Heather seeks popularity, and she badgers Melinda to join various clubs. Rachel, Melinda’s ex-best friend, hasn’t tried to find out the truth about what really happened to Melinda that night at the party over the summer.
Melinda describes her classes, activities, and thoughts. Her project in Mr. Freeman’s art class is to create a work of art based on a “tree,” which is the object named on the piece of paper she randomly chooses. In biology, Melinda thinks that David Petrakis, her lab partner, might be cute without the braces. And in algebra, when Mr. Stetman has Rachel come to the board to help Melinda with a problem, Melinda is humiliated. 
Melinda often skips class using stolen late passes and doesn’t complete her homework. She finds refuge at school in a vacant janitor’s closet, which she turns into her “burrow.” At the Homecoming Rally, students bully her for being the one who called the cops that night at the party.
At home, Melinda and her parents communicate with each other by leaving notes on the refrigerator. In her bedroom, she no longer wants to look in the mirror and puts it in the back of her closet. Toward the end of the marking period, Melinda’s parents hear from the school about her missing work, and she remains silent while they berate her for failing. Through it all, Melinda sees “IT” everywhere, the nightmare from which she cannot awaken.
In “Second Marking Period,” school is a grind for Melinda. At her parents’ insistence, she stays after to finish her homework, but she goes to her burrow and naps instead. In social studies, David Petrakis stands up against Mr. Neck’s racist rant about immigration. In biology, she finds that a seed within the apple she has cut is already growing. Heather gives her an early Christmas present, and Melinda decides she’ll give Heather a friendship necklace. 
On Christmas, Melinda nearly tells her parents what happened that night last summer but can’t. Winter break is miserable. Her parents keep her busy working for them, and she is relieved when school starts again. 
In gym class, Melinda impresses the basketball coaches with skills but has no interest in being on the team. She reluctantly helps Heather in her attempts to become an initiated member of a do-good club. And in biology, when she and David dissect a frog, she faints when preparing to slice it open. 
Melinda’s parents receive another call from the guidance counselor about her grades. After their verbal assault, Melinda goes to her room and uses an open paper clip to scrape at her wrist. 
“IT”, who we learn is Andy Evans, harasses Melinda in the cafeteria, and she runs to the bathroom to vomit. She has yet to tell anyone, even the reader, about what happened that summer night.
In “Third Marking Period,” Melinda continues to skip school and avoid Andy Evans. Heather ends their friendship suddenly, and later returns the friendship necklace Melinda had given her for Christmas. No one, Melinda is sure, “would like the inside girl I think I am.” 
The school counselors hold another meeting with Melinda’s parents, who berate and threaten her. She refuses to talk or defend herself. She receives In-School Suspension, and IT is there. He sits next to her and blows in her ear when Mr. Neck isn’t looking. 
In art class, Mr. Freeman gives Melinda a book about Picasso to help her “paralyzed” imagination. Picasso’s art inspires her, and she begins to draw. Mr. Freeman recognizes that she has a lot to say.
Melinda works to meet the expectations set for her. Yet, with “no friends in the known universe,” Melinda sits alone at lunch, wondering if everyone is talking and laughing about her. 
One afternoon, after a basketball game, David Petrakis invites her to his house for pizza to celebrate the team’s one-point win. She declines, torn between getting a life, and the fact that the world is a dangerous place.
At last, Melinda reveals that she was attacked at a party last summer, though she does not use the word “rape.” At this point, we (the readers) are the only ones besides Melinda who know what happened.
In “Fourth Marking Period,” Melinda takes her ex-friend Ivy’s advice and tries drawing a tree instead of carving one from linoleum block. She also learns that Rachel is dating Andy Evans. Compelled to do something, she writes a note to Rachel warning her about Andy. In the note, she admits for the first time (but without divulging her identity), that she was raped. 
Springtime arrives, and Melinda finds solace working in the garden. She and David plan a protest in social studies class over an oral report she is supposed to present, and she stands up to Heather by refusing to help her decorate for the Senior Prom. She writes on a stall in the bathroom, “Guys to Stay Away From: Andy Evans.” Andy Evans continues to bully her. 
Melinda feels compelled to tell Rachel the truth about Andy and what happened that night. But, when Rachel learns that Andy Evans was Melinda’s attacker, she accuses Melinda of being jealous and calls her a “twisted little freak.” Later, Ivy brings Melinda into the bathroom stall. Other girls have added words like “creep” and “bastard” under Andy Evan’s name. Seeing that, Melinda feels like she can fly.
Melinda realizes she doesn’t need her burrow anymore. When she is clearing her items out of the closet, Andy Evans barges in, attacks Melinda, and tries to rape her again. She finds her voice and screams “NNNOOO!!” He does not back off, so Melinda breaks a mirror, takes a shard of glass, and holds it to his neck. “I said no,” she tells him. People who had heard her scream run for help.
With hours left in the school year, Melinda finds herself a sort of hero. She finishes her tree project, receiving an A+ from Mr. Freeman."
However,"The Giver is written from the point of view of Jonas, an eleven-year-old boy living in a futuristic society that has eliminated all pain, fear, war, and hatred. There is no prejudice, since everyone looks and acts basically the same, and there is very little competition. Everyone is unfailingly polite. The society has also eliminated choice: at age twelve every member of the community is assigned a job based on his or her abilities and interests. Citizens can apply for and be assigned compatible spouses, and each couple is assigned exactly two children each. The children are born to Birthmothers, who never see them, and spend their first year in a Nurturing Center with other babies, or “newchildren,” born that year. When their children are grown, family units dissolve and adults live together with Childless Adults until they are too old to function in the society. Then they spend their last years being cared for in the House of the Old until they are finally “released” from the society. In the community, release is death, but it is never described that way; most people think that after release, flawed newchildren and joyful elderly people are welcomed into the vast expanse of Elsewhere that surrounds the communities. Citizens who break rules or fail to adapt properly to the society’s codes of behavior are also released, though in their cases it is an occasion of great shame. Everything is planned and organized so that life is as convenient and pleasant as possible.
Jonas lives with his father, a Nurturer of new children, his mother, who works at the Department of Justice, and his seven-year-old sister Lily. At the beginning of the novel, he is apprehensive about the upcoming Ceremony of Twelve, when he will be given his official Assignment as a new adult member of the community. He does not have a distinct career preference, although he enjoys volunteering at a variety of different jobs. Though he is a well-behaved citizen and a good student, Jonas is different: he has pale eyes, while most people in his community have dark eyes, and he has unusual powers of perception. Sometimes objects “change” when he looks at them. He does not know it yet, but he alone in his community can perceive flashes of color; for everyone else, the world is as devoid of color as it is of pain, hunger, and inconvenience.
At the Ceremony of Twelve, Jonas is given the highly honored Assignment of Receiver of Memory. The Receiver is the sole keeper of the community’s collective memory. When the community went over to Sameness—its painless, warless, and mostly emotionless state of tranquility and harmony—it abandoned all memories of pain, war, and emotion, but the memories cannot disappear totally. Someone must keep them so that the community can avoid making the mistakes of the past, even though no one but the Receiver can bear the pain. Jonas receives the memories of the past, good and bad, from the current Receiver, a wise old man who tells Jonas to call him the Giver.
The Giver transmits memories by placing his hands on Jonas’s bare back. The first memory he receives is of an exhilarating sled ride. As Jonas receives memories from the Giver—memories of pleasure and pain, of bright colors and extreme cold and warm sun, of excitement and terror and hunger and love—he realizes how bland and empty life in his community really is. The memories make Jonas’s life richer and more meaningful, and he wishes that he could give that richness and meaning to the people he loves. But in exchange for their peaceful existence, the people of Jonas’s community have lost the capacity to love him back or to feel deep passion about anything. Since they have never experienced real suffering, they also cannot appreciate the real joy of life, and the life of individual people seems less precious to them. In addition, no one in Jonas’s community has ever made a choice of his or her own. Jonas grows more and more frustrated with the members of his community, and the Giver, who has felt the same way for many years, encourages him. The two grow very close, like a grandfather and a grandchild might have in the days before Sameness, when family members stayed in contact long after their children were grown.
Meanwhile, Jonas is helping his family take care of a problem newchild, Gabriel, who has trouble sleeping through the night at the Nurturing Center. Jonas helps the child to sleep by transmitting soothing memories to him every night, and he begins to develop a relationship with Gabriel that mirrors the family relationships he has experienced through the memories. When Gabriel is in danger of being released, the Giver reveals to Jonas that release is the same as death. Jonas’s rage and horror at this revelation inspire the Giver to help Jonas devise a plan to change things in the community forever. The Giver tells Jonas about the girl who had been designated the new Receiver ten years before. She had been the Giver’s own daughter, but the sadness of some of the memories had been too much for her and she had asked to be released. When she died, all of the memories she had accumulated were released into the community, and the community members could not handle the sudden influx of emotion and sensation. The Giver and Jonas plan for Jonas to escape the community and to actually enter Elsewhere. Once he has done that, his larger supply of memories will disperse, and the Giver will help the community to come to terms with the new feelings and thoughts, changing the society forever.
However, Jonas is forced to leave earlier than planned when his father tells him that Gabriel will be released the next day. Desperate to save Gabriel, Jonas steals his father’s bicycle and a supply of food and sets off for Elsewhere. Gradually, he enters a landscape full of color, animals, and changing weather, but also hunger, danger, and exhaustion. Avoiding search planes, Jonas and Gabriel travel for a long time until heavy snow makes bike travel impossible. Half-frozen, but comforting Gabriel with memories of sunshine and friendship, Jonas mounts a high hill. There he finds a sled—the sled from his first transmitted memory—waiting for him at the top. Jonas and Gabriel experience a glorious downhill ride on the sled. Ahead of them, they see—or think they see—the twinkling lights of a friendly village at Christmas, and they hear music. Jonas is sure that someone is waiting for them there."
Memory,"Sophie Caco, age twelve, comes home from school in Croix-des-Rosets, Haiti, to the house she shares with her beloved, illiterate aunt Atie. Noting sadness in her aunt, Sophie presents Atie with a handmade Mother's Day card she had been meaning to save. But Atie refuses to take it, insisting that the card belongs to Martine, her sister and Sophie's absent mother.
That night, at the konbit potluck dinner, Atie is forced to reveal that Martine has mailed her a plane ticket and instructions to send Sophie to her mother in New York. The gossips are delighted, but Sophie is devastated.
Preparations for the trip begin. Sophie and Atie make a trip to La Nouvelle Dame Marie, Haiti, to obtain the blessing of Sophie's maternal Grandmè Ifé for Sophie's voyage. That week, Atie works late to buy Sophie a new dress for her trip. On the morning of Sophie's departure, the taxi arrives in the middle of breakfast. Arriving in Port-au-Prince, Sophie and Atie find themselves in the midst of a riot over the airport's name change. Sophie is rushed onto the plane along with a small hysterical boy whose father, a corrupt government official, has just been killed in the demonstration.
Arriving in New York, Sophie is met by Martine, who looks scrawny and tired, unlike the smiling woman in Atie's photographs. Arriving home to a poor neighborhood, Martine tells Sophie that her only chance lies in academic success. Sophie promises to work hard. That night, she wakes to find Martine the midst of a violent nightmare. Sophie wakes her, and Martine thanks Sophie for saving her life.
The next night, Sophie and Martine go to a Haitian restaurant with Marc, an affluent Haitian immigration lawyer who has become Martine's long-term lover. Sophie realizes that she is a relic of her mother's past, and is ashamed that she looks like no one in her family.
In the months before school starts, Sophie spends her days with Martine at her various jobs. Late one night, as Martine is babysitting an invalid old woman, she reveals to Sophie that her own mother used to test for virginity by making sure her hymen was intact. But this testing stopped early, as Martine was raped by a masked man at sixteen on her way home from school, leaving her pregnant with Sophie. The rapist's unseen face is mirrored in Sophie's own.
Six years have passed and Martine's work is paying off, though her nightmares continue. The Cacos have moved to a small house in a neighborhood near Marc, and Sophie is preparing to attend college. In the past six years, Sophie has done little but study, and has known no men. Now, she finds herself attracted to Joseph, the older musician next door. While Martine works night and day, Sophie and Joseph gradually become friends. He is kind, articulate and respectful. Eventually, he asks her to marry him.
Coming home late the next night, Sophie is caught by a furious, frantic Martine, who takes her upstairs and promptly tests her virginity. In the weeks that follow, the testing continues and Sophie begins to feel depressed and isolated. Finally, in desperation, Sophie impales herself her mother's spice pestle, breaking her hymen. She subsequently fails Martine's test, and is thrown out of the house, whereupon she elopes with Joseph to Providence, R.I.
Sophie arrives in La Nouvelle Dame Marie, Haiti, with her infant daughter Brigitte, not having spoken to her mother in two years. She finds Macoutes wandering the marketplace, a desperate Louise trying to raise money to leave Haiti, and an increasingly alcoholic Atie. Nonetheless, the women are delighted with Brigitte, whom they declare has Martine's face.
The reasons for Sophie's trip gradually become evident. She left while Joseph was on tour, driven to desperation by a hatred of her body and a terror of sex. Though Joseph is understanding and kind, she cannot sleep with him without doubling. She blames her phobia on Martine's testing of her, and in turn on Grandmè Ifé's testing of Martine.
Several days into her trip, Louise arrives in tears with the news that the Macoutes have arbitrarily killed a poor coal seller, Dessalines, in the marketplace. Sophie mediates on her mother's rape, probably due to a Macoute, and on the Haitian obsession with female purity.
The next week, Martine arrives in Dame Marie, summoned by Grandmè Ifé for the purpose of reconciliation. She tells Sophie that although they started off wrong, now that Sophie is an adult, she and Martine can begin again. The sympathy between them returns. That night, Atie and Martine reflect on the mess of their lives. Later, Grandmè Ifé, fed up with Louise's influence on Atie, finally buys her pig so that she will have money to leave the country. Louise leaves without telling Atie goodbye.
On the plane home, the stress of being in Haiti leaves Martine physically ill. Sophie spends the night at her mother's house, and the next morning Martine reveals that she is pregnant by Marc. As a result, her nightmares of the rape have been getting worse, and she does not know what to do.
Sophie returns home to Joseph, who is furious at her for leaving, though he loves her very much. In that week, Sophie attends her sexual phobia group and meets with her therapist, Rena, while Joseph tries to help her heal.
As a gesture of goodwill, Martine invites Sophie and Joseph to spend that Saturday with her and Marc. The day is spent eating, laughing, and singing spirituals. When Sophie, Joseph and Brigitte return home, Martine calls to tell Sophie that the baby has begun speaking to her in the rapist's voice, and that she has decided she must have an abortion.
The next day, Sophie returns from therapy to an urgent message from Marc. When she finally gets through, he tells her that Martine has committed suicide by stabbing herself in the stomach with a rusty knife seventeen times. She died in the ambulance after telling Marc that she could not carry the baby.
Sophie and Marc make the trip to Dame Marie for Martine's burial. During the funeral, unable to watch dirt being shoveled over her mother, Sophie runs into the cane fields, the scene of her mother's rape, and begins violently attacking the stalks. She has finally become free."
Referred,"Offred is a Handmaid in the Republic of Gilead, a totalitarian and theocratic state that has replaced the United States of America. Because of dangerously low reproduction rates, Handmaids are assigned to bear children for elite couples that have trouble conceiving. Offred serves the Commander and his wife, Serena Joy, a former gospel singer and advocate for “traditional values.” Offred is not the narrator’s real name—Handmaid names consist of the word “of” followed by the name of the Handmaid’s Commander. Every month, when Offred is at the right point in her menstrual cycle, she must have ritualized sex with the Commander while Serena sits behind her, holding her hands. Offred’s freedom, like the freedom of all women, is completely restricted. She can leave the house only on shopping trips, the door to her room cannot be completely shut, and the Eyes, Gilead’s secret police force, watch her every public move.
As Offred tells the story of her daily life, she frequently slips into flashbacks, from which the reader can reconstruct the events leading up to the beginning of the novel. In the old world, before Gilead, Offred had an affair with Luke, a married man. Luke divorced his wife and married Offred, and they had a child together. Offred’s mother was a single mother and feminist activist. Offred’s best friend, Moira, was fiercely independent. The architects of Gilead began their rise to power in an age of readily available pornography, prostitution, and violence against women—when pollution and chemical spills led to declining fertility rates. Using the military, they assassinated the president and members of Congress and launched a coup, claiming that they were taking power temporarily. They cracked down on women’s rights, forbidding women to hold property or jobs. Offred and Luke took their daughter and attempted to flee across the border into Canada, but they were caught and separated from one another, and Offred has seen neither her husband nor her daughter since.
After her capture, Offred’s marriage was voided (because Luke had been divorced), and she was sent to the Rachel and Leah Re-education Center, called the Red Center by its inhabitants. At the center, women were indoctrinated into Gilead’s ideology in preparation for becoming Handmaids. Aunt Lydia supervised the women, giving speeches extolling Gilead’s beliefs that women should be subservient to men and solely concerned with bearing children. Aunt Lydia also argued that such a social order ultimately offers women more respect and safety than the old, pre-Gilead society offered them. Moira is brought to the Red Center, but she escapes, and Offred does not know what becomes of her.
Once Offred is assigned to the Commander’s house, her life settles into a restrictive routine. She takes shopping trips with Ofglen, another Handmaid, and they visit the Wall outside what used to be Harvard University, where the bodies of rebels hang. She must visit the doctor frequently to be checked for disease and other complications, and she must endure the “Ceremony,” in which the Commander reads to the household from the Bible, then goes to the bedroom, where Serena and Offred wait for him, and has sex with Offred.
The first break from her routine occurs when she visits the doctor and he offers to have sex with her to get her pregnant, suggesting that her Commander is probably infertile. She refuses. The doctor makes her uneasy, but his proposition is too risky—she could be sent away if caught. After a Ceremony, the Commander sends his gardener and chauffeur, Nick, to ask Offred to come see him in his study the following night. She begins visiting him regularly. They play Scrabble (which is forbidden, since women are not allowed to read), and he lets her look at old magazines like Vogue. At the end of these secret meetings, he asks her to kiss him.
During one of their shopping trips, Ofglen reveals to Offred that she is a member of “Mayday,” an underground organization dedicated to overthrowing Gilead. Meanwhile, Offred begins to find that the Ceremony feels different and less impersonal now that she knows the Commander. Their nighttime conversations begin to touch on the new order that the Commander and his fellow leaders have created in Gilead. When Offred admits how unhappy she is, the Commander remarks, “[Y]ou can’t make an omelette without breaking eggs.”
After some time has gone by without Offred becoming pregnant, Serena suggests that Offred have sex with Nick secretly and pass the child off as the Commander’s. Serena promises to bring Offred a picture of her daughter if she sleeps with Nick, and Offred realizes with horror that Serena has always known where her daughter was. The same night that Offred is to sleep with Nick, the Commander secretly takes her out to a club called Jezebel’s, where the Commanders mingle with prostitutes. Offred sees Moira working there. The two women meet in a bathroom, and Offred learns that Moira was captured just before she crossed the border. She chose life in Jezebel’s over being sent to the Colonies, where most political prisoners and others who pose a threat to Gilead are sent. After that night at Jezebel’s, Offred says, she never sees Moira again. The Commander takes Offred upstairs after a few hours, and they have sex in what used to be a hotel room. She tries to feign passion.
Soon after Offred returns from Jezebel’s, late at night, Serena arrives and tells Offred to go to Nick’s room. Offred and Nick have sex. Soon they begin to sleep together frequently, without anyone’s knowledge. Offred becomes caught up in the affair and ignores Ofglen’s requests that she gather information from the Commander for Mayday. One day, all the Handmaids take part in a group execution of a supposed rapist, supervised by Aunt Lydia. Ofglen strikes the first blow. Later, she tells Offred that the so-called rapist was a member of Mayday and that she hit him to put him out of his misery.
Shortly thereafter, Offred goes out shopping, and a new Ofglen meets her. This new woman is not part of Mayday, and she tells Offred that the old Ofglen hanged herself when she saw the secret police coming for her. At home, Serena has found out about Offred’s trip to Jezebel’s, and she sends her to her room, promising punishment. Offred waits there, and she sees a black van from the Eyes approach. Then Nick comes in and tells her that the Eyes are really Mayday members who have come to save her. Offred leaves with them, over the Commander’s futile objections, on her way either to prison or to freedom—she does not know which.
The novel closes with an epilogue from 2195, after Gilead has fallen, written in the form of a lecture given by Professor Pieixoto. He explains the formation and customs of Gilead in objective, analytical language. He discusses the significance of Offred’s story, which has been found on cassette tapes in Bangor, Maine. Pieixoto suggests that Nick arranged Offred’s escape but that her fate after that is unknown. She could have escaped to Canada or England, or she could have been recaptured."
Conceive,"The action covered in Tristram Shandy spans the years 1680-1766. Sterne obscures the story's underlying chronology, however, by rearranging the order of the various pieces of his tale. He also subordinates the basic plot framework by weaving together a number of different stories, as well as such disparate materials as essays, sermons, and legal documents. There are, nevertheless, two clearly discernible narrative lines in the book.
The first is the plot sequence that includes Tristram's conception, birth, christening, and accidental circumcision. (This sequence extends somewhat further in Tristram's treatment of his ""breeching,"" the problem of his education, and his first and second tours of France, but these events are handled less extensively and are not as central to the text.) It takes six volumes to cover this chain of events, although comparatively few pages are spent in actually advancing such a simple plot. The story occurs as a series of accidents, all of which seem calculated to confound Walter Shandy's hopes and expectations for his son. The manner of his conception is the first disaster, followed by the flattening of his nose at birth, a misunderstanding in which he is given the wrong name, and an accidental run-in with a falling window-sash. The catastrophes that befall Tristram are actually relatively trivial; only in the context of Walter Shandy's eccentric, pseudo-scientific theories do they become calamities.
The second major plot consists of the fortunes of Tristram's Uncle Toby. Most of the details of this story are concentrated in the final third of the novel, although they are alluded to and developed in piecemeal fashion from the very beginning. Toby receives a wound to the groin while in the army, and it takes him four years to recover. When he is able to move around again, he retires to the country with the idea of constructing a scaled replica of the scene of the battle in which he was injured. He becomes obsessed with re-enacting those battles, as well as with the whole history and theory of fortification and defense. The Peace of Utrecht slows him down in these ""hobby-horsical"" activities, however, and it is during this lull that he falls under the spell of Widow Wadman. The novel ends with the long-promised account of their unfortunate affair."
Pile,"Katniss Everdeen wakes up on the day of the reaping, when the tributes are chosen who will take part in the Hunger Games. Her mother and little sister, Prim, sleep nearby. Her father died in a mine explosion years earlier. She goes hunting in the woods outside her district, District 12, with Gale, her best friend. That night, at the reaping ceremony, the mayor gives a speech describing how the governments of North America collapsed and the country of Panem rose up in their place. A war ensued between the Capitol and the districts. The Capitol won, and as a reminder of their defeat, the Capitol holds the Hunger Games every year. The mayor then introduces Haymitch Abernathy, District 12’s only living Hunger-Games winner, and he’s so drunk he ends up falling in his own vomit.
The district’s female tribute is chosen, and to Katniss’s horror, it’s Prim. Katniss volunteers immediately in Prim’s place. Then the male tribute is selected. It’s Peeta Mellark, and Katniss remembers how years earlier, while searching for food for her family in the garbage bins behind the town shops, Peeta gave her bread from his family’s bakery. Katniss credits him with saving her that day. Katniss and Peeta say goodbye to their friends and families and board a train for the Capitol. During the trip, she and Peeta convince Haymitch, their mentor in the Games and the person responsible for getting them gifts from sponsors, to take his duties seriously.
Once there, Katniss meets with her stylist, Cinna, who is designing her dress for the opening ceremony. At the ceremony, Katniss and Peeta wear simple black outfits lit with synthetic flames. The outfits are a huge hit with the audience and make Katniss and Peeta stand out among the tributes. The next day, Katniss and Peeta attend group training, and the tributes from rich districts who have trained for the Games their whole lives, called Career Tributes, show off their skills. Later, the tributes are interviewed by Caesar Flickerman, a television host. In his interview, Peeta reveals that he’s had a crush on Katniss for several years.
Finally the time comes. From a small underground room, Katniss is lifted into the arena and the Games officially begin. All the tributes are there, and in front of her is the Cornucopia, which houses an abundance of supplies. Rather than fight, she runs away as Haymitch advised. She hikes all day before making camp. After dark, someone starts a fire nearby, and it isn’t long before a pack of Career Tributes arrives and kills the person. To Katniss’s shock, Peeta is with them. The next day Katniss goes in search of water. She walks for hours and collapses from exhaustion, but ultimately she finds a stream. She’s woken in the night by a wall of fire moving in her direction, and as she runs away one of the numerous fireballs falling around her grazes her leg, injuring it.
That night, while she hides in a tree from the pack of Careers below, she notices a young girl named Rue from District 11 in a nearby tree. Rue points out a nest of tracker jackers, wasps engineered by the Capitol to be lethal, over Katniss’s head, and Katniss cuts the branch holding the nest, dropping it onto the Careers. Two of them die from the stings and the rest scatter. Katniss is stung a few times as well, but as she’s running away, she remembers one of the girls who died had a bow and arrows, the weapons she’s become proficient with from hunting. She runs back to retrieve them, and Peeta happens to arrive as she’s grabbing the bow. He yells at Katniss to run just as Cato, a very large and dangerous Career from District 2, shows up. Peeta stops him so Katniss can escape, and she passes out in a ditch shortly after.
Katniss encounters Rue again, and the two quickly form a bond. They are able to get food hunting and foraging, and Katniss realizes that the Careers would have difficulty surviving without the supplies at the Cornucopia, so she and Rue devise a plan. While Rue lights decoy fires, Katniss sneaks up to the Cornucopia. The supplies are in a pyramid away from the main camp, and after the Careers leave to investigate the fires, Katniss manages to blow up the supplies by cutting open a bag of apples with her arrows, which sets off the mines set to protect the pyramid. When Katniss doesn’t find Rue at their meeting spot, she goes looking for her and finds her just as another tribute stabs her with a spear. Katniss kills the other tribute, and when Rue dies, she covers her body in flowers.
Katniss is depressed all the next day, until an announcement is made that there has been a rule change: Now, two tributes from the same district can be declared winners. Katniss goes looking for Peeta, and it takes her a day but finally she finds him. He’s severely injured from his fight with Cato and can barely walk, but Katniss helps him to a cave where they’ll be hidden. Thinking Peeta may die, Katniss impulsively kisses him. A moment later she hears a noise outside and finds a pot of broth sent from Haymitch. She realizes that Haymitch will reward her for playing up the romance between her and Peeta. The next morning Katniss sees that Peeta’s leg is badly infected and he’ll die without treatment. Another announcement is made, this time saying each tribute will find an item they desperately need at the Cornucopia. Katniss knows that means medicine for Peeta’s leg, but Peeta thinks it’s too dangerous and doesn’t want Katniss to go. Using a sleep syrup sent from Haymitch, Katniss knocks him out.
At the Cornucopia, Katniss tries to run and grab the item marked for District 12, but she gets into a fight with a female tribute. The tribute is about to kill her when Thresh, the male tribute from District 11 who came to the Games with Rue, kills the girl instead. He spares Katniss because of the way she treated Rue, and Katniss makes it back to the cave. She injects Peeta with the medicine just before passing out. They stay there for a few days while it rains nonstop outside, and in this time the romance between Katniss and Peeta progresses. When the rain lets up, Peeta and Katniss need to find food. Katniss leaves Peeta in charge of foraging while she goes to hunt. She comes back hours later and finds a small pile of poisonous berries Peeta collected thinking they were safe. They discover the body of a tribute who Katniss nicknamed Foxface, and Katniss realizes she died from eating the berries. By this point Cato, who killed Thresh, is the only tribute left, and Katniss decides to keep some berries in case they can trick Cato the same way. Eventually the streams and ponds dry up, and they know the only source of water left is the lake near the Cornucopia. Without any other choice, they start walking to the lake.
By the lake, Cato comes suddenly barreling toward them. Unexpectedly, however, he runs straight by them. Katniss realizes there are strange creatures chasing him, and they all run to the Cornucopia and climb up. The creatures are mutant wolves engineered by the Capitol, and Katniss realizes they are actually the dead tributes, who have been turned into these monsters. Taking advantage of the situation, Cato attacks Peeta, but Katniss and Peeta manage to push him over the edge. The creatures overpower him, but because of the body armor he’s wearing he remains alive for hours, until Katniss shoots him out of pity. Just as Katniss and Peeta think they’ve won, another announcement is made that there can only be one winner again. Neither Katniss nor Peeta will kill the other, so Katniss takes out the poisonous berries. Just as she and Peeta pop them in their mouths, the announcer shouts for them to stop and declares them both winners.
They go back to the Training Center and Katniss is kept alone for days while she recuperates. When she is let out, Haymitch warns her that she’s in danger. The Capitol took her stunt with the berries as an act of defiance, so she has to convince everyone that she was desperate at the thought of losing Peeta and not being rebellious, or even her family could be at risk. In their final interview, she’s reunited with Peeta, who lost his leg and now has a prosthetic. After, when Haymitch tells her she did great, Peeta wonders what he means, and Katniss explains everything, including the romance strategy during the Games. Peeta is angry and hurt, but as they arrive back in District 12, they hold hands one more time to greet the crowd and cameras."
Eminent,"Scout Finch lives with her brother, Jem, and their widowed father, Atticus, in the sleepy Alabama town of Maycomb. Maycomb is suffering through the Great Depression, but Atticus is a prominent lawyer and the Finch family is reasonably well off in comparison to the rest of society. One summer, Jem and Scout befriend a boy named Dill, who has come to live in their neighborhood for the summer, and the trio acts out stories together. Eventually, Dill becomes fascinated with the spooky house on their street called the Radley Place. The house is owned by Mr. Nathan Radley, whose brother, Arthur (nicknamed Boo), has lived there for years without venturing outside.
Scout goes to school for the first time that fall and detests it. She and Jem find gifts apparently left for them in a knothole of a tree on the Radley property. Dill returns the following summer, and he, Scout, and Jem begin to act out the story of Boo Radley. Atticus puts a stop to their antics, urging the children to try to see life from another person’s perspective before making judgments. But, on Dill’s last night in Maycomb for the summer, the three sneak onto the Radley property, where Nathan Radley shoots at them. Jem loses his pants in the ensuing escape. When he returns for them, he finds them mended and hung over the fence.
The next winter, Jem and Scout find more presents in the tree, presumably left by the mysterious Boo. Nathan Radley eventually plugs the knothole with cement. Shortly thereafter, a fire breaks out in another neighbor’s house, and during the fire someone slips a blanket on Scout’s shoulders as she watches the blaze. Convinced that Boo did it, Jem tells Atticus about the mended pants and the presents.
To the consternation of Maycomb’s racist white community, Atticus agrees to defend a Black man named Tom Robinson, who has been accused of raping a white woman. Because of Atticus’s decision, Jem and Scout are subjected to abuse from other children, even when they celebrate Christmas at the family compound on Finch’s Landing. Calpurnia, the Finches’ Black cook, takes them to the local Black church, where the warm and close-knit community largely embraces the children.
Atticus’s sister, Alexandra, comes to live with the Finches the next summer. Dill, who is supposed to live with his “new father” in another town, runs away and comes to Maycomb. Tom Robinson’s trial begins, and when the accused man is placed in the local jail, a mob gathers to lynch him. Atticus faces the mob down the night before the trial. Jem and Scout, who have sneaked out of the house, soon join him. Scout recognizes one of the men, and her polite questioning about his son shames him into dispersing the mob.
At the trial itself, the children sit in the “colored balcony” with the town’s Black citizens. Atticus provides clear evidence that the accusers, Mayella Ewell and her father, Bob, are lying: in fact, Mayella propositioned Tom Robinson, was caught by her father, and then accused Tom of rape to cover her shame and guilt. Atticus provides impressive evidence that the marks on Mayella’s face are from wounds that her father inflicted; upon discovering her with Tom, he called her a whore and beat her. Yet, despite the significant evidence pointing to Tom’s innocence, the all-white jury convicts him. The innocent Tom later tries to escape from prison and is shot to death. In the aftermath of the trial, Jem’s faith in justice is badly shaken, and he lapses into despondency and doubt.
Despite the verdict, Bob Ewell feels that Atticus and the judge have made a fool out of him, and he vows revenge. He menaces Tom Robinson’s widow, tries to break into the judge’s house, and finally attacks Jem and Scout as they walk home from a Halloween party. Boo Radley intervenes, however, saving the children and stabbing Ewell fatally during the struggle. Boo carries the wounded Jem back to Atticus’s house, where the sheriff, in order to protect Boo, insists that Ewell tripped over a tree root and fell on his own knife. After sitting with Scout for a while, Boo disappears once more into the Radley house.  
Later, Scout feels as though she can finally imagine what life is like for Boo. He has become a human being to her at last. With this realization, Scout embraces her father’s advice to practice sympathy and understanding and demonstrates that her experiences with hatred and prejudice will not sully her faith in human goodness."
Forbear,"General Prologue
At the Tabard Inn, a tavern in Southwark, near London, the narrator joins a company of twenty-nine pilgrims. The pilgrims, like the narrator, are traveling to the shrine of the martyr Saint Thomas Becket in Canterbury. The narrator gives a descriptive account of twenty-seven of these pilgrims, including a Knight, Squire, Yeoman, Prioress, Monk, Friar, Merchant, Clerk, Man of Law, Franklin, Haberdasher, Carpenter, Weaver, Dyer, Tapestry-Weaver, Cook, Shipman, Physician, Wife, Parson, Plowman, Miller, Manciple, Reeve, Summoner, Pardoner, and Host. (He does not describe the Second Nun or the Nun’s Priest, although both characters appear later in the book.)
The Host, whose name, we find out in the Prologue to the Cook’s Tale, is Harry Bailey, suggests that the group ride together and entertain one another with stories. He decides that each pilgrim will tell two stories on the way to Canterbury and two on the way back. Whomever he judges to be the best storyteller will receive a meal at Bailey’s tavern, courtesy of the other pilgrims. The pilgrims draw lots and determine that the Knight will tell the first tale.
The Knight’s Tale
Theseus, duke of Athens, imprisons Arcite and Palamon, two knights from Thebes (another city in ancient Greece). From their prison, the knights see and fall in love with Theseus’s sister-in-law, Emelye. Through the intervention of a friend, Arcite is freed, but he is banished from Athens. He returns in disguise and becomes a page in Emelye’s chamber. Palamon escapes from prison, and the two meet and fight over Emelye. Theseus apprehends them and arranges a tournament between the two knights and their allies, with Emelye as the prize. Arcite wins, but he is accidentally thrown from his horse and dies. Palamon then marries Emelye.
The Miller’s Prologue and Tale
The Host asks the Monk to tell the next tale, but the drunken Miller interrupts and insists that his tale should be the next. He tells the story of an impoverished student named Nicholas, who persuades his landlord’s sexy young wife, Alisoun, to spend the night with him. He convinces his landlord, a carpenter named John, that the second flood is coming, and tricks him into spending the night in a tub hanging from the ceiling of his barn. Absolon, a young parish clerk who is also in love with Alisoun, appears outside the window of the room where Nicholas and Alisoun lie together.
When Absolon begs Alisoun for a kiss, she sticks her rear end out the window in the dark and lets him kiss it. Absolon runs and gets a red-hot poker, returns to the window, and asks for another kiss; when Nicholas sticks his bottom out the window and farts, Absolon brands him on the buttocks. Nicholas’s cries for water make the carpenter think that the flood has come, so the carpenter cuts the rope connecting his tub to the ceiling, falls down, and breaks his arm.
The Reeve’s Prologue and Tale
Because he also does carpentry, the Reeve takes offense at the Miller’s tale of a stupid carpenter, and counters with his own tale of a dishonest miller. The Reeve tells the story of two students, John and Alayn, who go to the mill to watch the miller grind their corn, so that he won’t have a chance to steal any. But the miller unties their horse, and while they chase it, he steals some of the flour he has just ground for them. By the time the students catch the horse, it is dark, so they spend the night in the miller’s house. That night, Alayn seduces the miller’s daughter, and John seduces his wife. When the miller wakes up and finds out what has happened, he tries to beat the students. His wife, thinking that her husband is actually one of the students, hits the miller over the head with a staff. The students take back their stolen goods and leave.
The Cook’s Prologue and Tale
The Cook particularly enjoys the Reeve’s Tale, and offers to tell another funny tale. The tale concerns an apprentice named Perkyn who drinks and dances so much that he is called “Perkyn Reveler.” Finally, Perkyn’s master decides that he would rather his apprentice leave to revel than stay home and corrupt the other servants. Perkyn arranges to stay with a friend who loves drinking and gambling, and who has a wife who is a prostitute. The tale breaks off, unfinished, after fifty-eight lines.
The Man of Law’s Introduction, Prologue, Tale, and Epilogue
The Host reminds his fellow pilgrims to waste no time, because lost time cannot be regained. He asks the Man of Law to tell the next tale. The Man of Law agrees, apologizing that he cannot tell any suitable tale that Chaucer has not already told—Chaucer may be unskilled as a poet, says the Man of Law, but he has told more stories of lovers than Ovid, and he doesn’t print tales of incest as John Gower does (Gower was a contemporary of Chaucer). In the Prologue to his tale, the Man of Law laments the miseries of poverty. He then remarks how fortunate merchants are, and says that his tale is one told to him by a merchant.
In the tale, the Muslim sultan of Syria converts his entire sultanate (including himself) to Christianity in order to persuade the emperor of Rome to give him his daughter, Custance, in marriage. The sultan’s mother and her attendants remain secretly faithful to Islam. The mother tells her son she wishes to hold a banquet for him and all the Christians. At the banquet, she massacres her son and all the Christians except for Custance, whom she sets adrift in a rudderless ship. After years of floating, Custance runs ashore in Northumberland, where a constable and his wife, Hermengyld, offer her shelter. She converts them to Christianity.
One night, Satan makes a young knight sneak into Hermengyld’s chamber and murder Hermengyld. He places the bloody knife next to Custance, who sleeps in the same chamber. When the constable returns home, accompanied by Alla, the king of Northumberland, he finds his slain wife. He tells Alla the story of how Custance was found, and Alla begins to pity the girl. He decides to look more deeply into the murder. Just as the knight who murdered Hermengyld is swearing that Custance is the true murderer, he is struck down and his eyes burst out of his face, proving his guilt to Alla and the crowd. The knight is executed, Alla and many others convert to Christianity, and Custance and Alla marry.
While Alla is away in Scotland, Custance gives birth to a boy named Mauricius. Alla’s mother, Donegild, intercepts a letter from Custance to Alla and substitutes a counterfeit one that claims that the child is disfigured and bewitched. She then intercepts Alla’s reply, which claims that the child should be kept and loved no matter how malformed. Donegild substitutes a letter saying that Custance and her son are banished and should be sent away on the same ship on which Custance arrived. Alla returns home, finds out what has happened, and kills Donegild.
After many adventures at sea, including an attempted rape, Custance ends up back in Rome, where she reunites with Alla, who has made a pilgrimage there to atone for killing his mother. She also reunites with her father, the emperor. Alla and Custance return to England, but Alla dies after a year, so Custance returns, once more, to Rome. Mauricius becomes the next Roman emperor.
Following the Man of Law’s Tale, the Host asks the Parson to tell the next tale, but the Parson reproaches him for swearing, and they fall to bickering.
The Wife of Bath’s Prologue and Tale
The Wife of Bath gives a lengthy account of her feelings about marriage. Quoting from the Bible, the Wife argues against those who believe it is wrong to marry more than once, and she explains how she dominated and controlled each of her five husbands. She married her fifth husband, Jankyn, for love instead of money. After the Wife has rambled on for a while, the Friar butts in to complain that she is taking too long, and the Summoner retorts that friars are like flies, always meddling. The Friar promises to tell a tale about a summoner, and the Summoner promises to tell a tale about a friar. The Host cries for everyone to quiet down and allow the Wife to commence her tale.
In her tale, a young knight of King Arthur’s court rapes a maiden; to atone for his crime, Arthur’s queen sends him on a quest to discover what women want most. An ugly old woman promises the knight that she will tell him the secret if he promises to do whatever she wants for saving his life. He agrees, and she tells him women want control of their husbands and their own lives. They go together to Arthur’s queen, and the old woman’s answer turns out to be correct. The old woman then tells the knight that he must marry her. When the knight confesses later that he is repulsed by her appearance, she gives him a choice: she can either be ugly and faithful, or beautiful and unfaithful. The knight tells her to make the choice herself, and she rewards him for giving her control of the marriage by rendering herself both beautiful and faithful.
The Friar’s Prologue and Tale
The Friar speaks approvingly of the Wife of Bath’s Tale, and offers to lighten things up for the company by telling a funny story about a lecherous summoner. The Summoner does not object, but he promises to pay the Friar back in his own tale. The Friar tells of an archdeacon who carries out the law without mercy, especially to lechers. The archdeacon has a summoner who has a network of spies working for him, to let him know who has been lecherous.
The summoner extorts money from those he’s sent to summon, charging them more money than he should for penance. He tries to serve a summons on a yeoman who is actually a devil in disguise. After comparing notes on their treachery and extortion, the devil vanishes, but when the summoner tries to prosecute an old wealthy widow unfairly, the widow cries out that the summoner should be taken to hell. The devil follows the woman’s instructions and drags the summoner off to hell.
The Summoner’s Prologue and Tale
The Summoner, furious at the Friar’s Tale, asks the company to let him tell the next tale. First, he tells the company that there is little difference between friars and fiends, and that when an angel took a friar down to hell to show him the torments there, the friar asked why there were no friars in hell; the angel then pulled up Satan’s tail and 20,000 friars came out of his ass.
In the Summoner’s Tale, a friar begs for money from a dying man named Thomas and his wife, who have recently lost their child. The friar shamelessly exploits the couple’s misfortunes to extract money from them, so Thomas tells the friar that he is sitting on something that he will bequeath to the friars. The friar reaches for his bequest, and Thomas lets out an enormous fart. The friar complains to the lord of the manor, whose squire promises to divide the fart evenly among all the friars.
The Clerk’s Prologue and Tale
The Host asks the Clerk to cheer up and tell a merry tale, and the Clerk agrees to tell a tale by the Italian poet Petrarch. Griselde is a hardworking peasant who marries into the aristocracy. Her husband tests her fortitude in several ways, including pretending to kill her children and divorcing her. He punishes her one final time by forcing her to prepare for his wedding to a new wife. She does all this dutifully, her husband tells her that she has always been and will always be his wife (the divorce was a fraud), and they live happily ever after.
The Merchant’s Prologue, Tale, and Epilogue
The Merchant reflects on the great difference between the patient Griselde of the Clerk’s Tale and the horrible shrew he has been married to for the past two months. The Host asks him to tell a story of the evils of marriage, and he complies. Against the advice of his friends, an old knight named January marries May, a beautiful young woman. She is less than impressed by his enthusiastic sexual efforts, and conspires to cheat on him with his squire, Damien. When blind January takes May into his garden to copulate with her, she tells him she wants to eat a pear, and he helps her up into the pear tree, where she has sex with Damien. Pluto, the king of the faeries, restores January’s sight, but May, caught in the act, assures him that he must still be blind. The Host prays to God to keep him from marrying a wife like the one the Merchant describes.
The Squire’s Introduction and Tale
The Host calls upon the Squire to say something about his favorite subject, love, and the Squire willingly complies. King Cambyuskan of the Mongol Empire is visited on his birthday by a knight bearing gifts from the king of Arabia and India. He gives Cambyuskan and his daughter Canacee a magic brass horse, a magic mirror, a magic ring that gives Canacee the ability to understand the language of birds, and a sword with the power to cure any wound it creates. She rescues a dying female falcon that narrates how her consort abandoned her for the love of another. The Squire’s Tale is either unfinished by Chaucer or is meant to be interrupted by the Franklin, who interjects that he wishes his own son were as eloquent as the Squire. The Host expresses annoyance at the Franklin’s interruption, and orders him to begin the next tale.
The Franklin’s Prologue and Tale
The Franklin says that his tale is a familiar Breton lay, a folk ballad of ancient Brittany. Dorigen, the heroine, awaits the return of her husband, Arveragus, who has gone to England to win honor in feats of arms. She worries that the ship bringing her husband home will wreck itself on the coastal rocks, and she promises Aurelius, a young man who falls in love with her, that she will give her body to him if he clears the rocks from the coast. Aurelius hires a student learned in magic to create the illusion that the rocks have disappeared. Arveragus returns home and tells his wife that she must keep her promise to Aurelius. Aurelius is so impressed by Arveragus’s honorable act that he generously absolves her of the promise, and the magician, in turn, generously absolves Aurelius of the money he owes.
The Physician’s Tale
Appius the judge lusts after Virginia, the beautiful daughter of Virginius. Appius persuades a churl named Claudius to declare her his slave, stolen from him by Virginius. Appius declares that Virginius must hand over his daughter to Claudius. Virginius tells his daughter that she must die rather than suffer dishonor, and she virtuously consents to her father’s cutting her head off. Appius sentences Virginius to death, but the Roman people, aware of Appius’s hijinks, throw him into prison, where he kills himself.
The Pardoner’s Introduction, Prologue, and Tale
The Host is dismayed by the tragic injustice of the Physician’s Tale, and asks the Pardoner to tell something merry. The other pilgrims contradict the Host, demanding a moral tale, which the Pardoner agrees to tell after he eats and drinks. The Pardoner tells the company how he cheats people out of their money by preaching that money is the root of all evil. His tale describes three riotous youths who go looking for Death, thinking that they can kill him. An old man tells them that they will find Death under a tree. Instead, they find eight bushels of gold, which they plot to sneak into town under cover of darkness.
The youngest goes into town to fetch food and drink, but brings back poison, hoping to have the gold all to himself. His companions kill him to enrich their own shares, then drink the poison and die under the tree. His tale complete, the Pardoner offers to sell the pilgrims pardons, and singles out the Host to come kiss his relics. The Host infuriates the Pardoner by accusing him of fraud, but the Knight persuades the two to kiss and bury their differences.
The Shipman’s Tale
The Shipman’s Tale features a monk who tricks a merchant’s wife into having sex with him by borrowing money from the merchant, then giving it to the wife so she can repay her own debt to her husband, in exchange for sexual favors. When the monk sees the merchant next, he tells him that he returned the merchant’s money to his wife. The wife realizes she has been duped, but she boldly tells her husband to forgive her debt: she will repay it in bed. The Host praises the Shipman’s story, and asks the Prioress for a tale.
The Prioress’s Prologue and Tale
The Prioress calls on the Virgin Mary to guide her tale. In an Asian city, a Christian school is located at the edge of a Jewish ghetto. An angelic seven-year-old boy, a widow’s son, attends the school. He is a devout Christian, and loves to sing Alma Redemptoris (Gracious Mother of the Redeemer). Singing the song on his way through the ghetto, some Jews hire a murderer to slit his throat and throw him into a latrine. The Jews refuse to tell the widow where her son is, but he miraculously begins to sing Alma Redemptoris, so the Christian people recover his body, and the magistrate orders the murdering Jews to be drawn apart by wild horses and then hanged.
The Prologue and Tale of Sir Thopas
The Host, after teasing Chaucer the narrator about his appearance, asks him to tell a tale. Chaucer says that he only knows one tale, then launches into a parody of bad poetry—the Tale of Sir Thopas. Sir Thopas rides about looking for an elf-queen to marry until he is confronted by a giant. The narrator’s doggerel continues in this vein until the Host can bear no more and interrupts him. Chaucer asks him why he can’t tell his tale, since it is the best he knows, and the Host explains that his rhyme isn’t worth a turd. He encourages Chaucer to tell a prose tale.
The Tale of Melibee
Chaucer’s second tale is the long, moral prose story of Melibee. Melibee’s house is raided by his foes, who beat his wife, Prudence, and severely wound his daughter, Sophie, in her feet, hands, ears, nose, and mouth. Prudence advises him not to rashly pursue vengeance on his enemies, and he follows her advice, putting his foes’ punishment in her hands. She forgives them for the outrages done to her, in a model of Christian forbearance and forgiveness.
The Monk’s Prologue and Tale
The Host wishes that his own wife were as patient as Melibee’s, and calls upon the Monk to tell the next tale. First he teases the Monk, pointing out that the Monk is clearly no poor cloisterer. The Monk takes it all in stride and tells a series of tragic falls, in which noble figures are brought low: Lucifer, Adam, Sampson, Hercules, Nebuchadnezzar, Belshazzar, Zenobia, Pedro of Castile, and down through the ages.
The Nun’s Priest’s Prologue, Tale, and Epilogue
After seventeen noble “falls” narrated by the Monk, the Knight interrupts, and the Host calls upon the Nun’s Priest to deliver something more lively. The Nun’s Priest tells of Chanticleer the Rooster, who is carried off by a flattering fox who tricks him into closing his eyes and displaying his crowing abilities. Chanticleer turns the tables on the fox by persuading him to open his mouth and brag to the barnyard about his feat, upon which Chanticleer falls out of the fox’s mouth and escapes. The Host praises the Nun’s Priest’s Tale, adding that if the Nun’s Priest were not in holy orders, he would be as sexually potent as Chanticleer.
The Second Nun’s Prologue and Tale
In her Prologue, the Second Nun explains that she will tell a saint’s life, that of Saint Cecilia, for this saint set an excellent example through her good works and wise teachings. She focuses particularly on the story of Saint Cecilia’s martyrdom. Before Cecilia’s new husband, Valerian, can take her virginity, she sends him on a pilgrimage to Pope Urban, who converts him to Christianity. An angel visits Valerian, who asks that his brother Tiburce be granted the grace of Christian conversion as well. All three—Cecilia, Tiburce, and Valerian—are put to death by the Romans.
The Canon’s Yeoman’s Prologue and Tale
When the Second Nun’s Tale is finished, the company is overtaken by a black-clad Canon and his Yeoman, who have heard of the pilgrims and their tales and wish to participate. The Yeoman brags to the company about how he and the Canon create the illusion that they are alchemists, and the Canon departs in shame at having his secrets discovered. The Yeoman tells a tale of how a canon defrauded a priest by creating the illusion of alchemy using sleight of hand.
The Manciple’s Prologue and Tale
The Host pokes fun at the Cook, riding at the back of the company, blind drunk. The Cook is unable to honor the Host’s request that he tell a tale, and the Manciple criticizes him for his drunkenness. The Manciple relates the legend of a white crow, taken from the Roman poet Ovid’s Metamorphoses and one of the tales in The Arabian Nights. In it, Phoebus’s talking white crow informs him that his wife is cheating on him. Phoebus kills the wife, pulls out the crow’s white feathers, and curses it with blackness.
The Parson’s Prologue and Tale
As the company enters a village in the late afternoon, the Host calls upon the Parson to give them a fable. Refusing to tell a fictional story because it would go against the rule set by St. Paul, the Parson delivers a lengthy treatise on the Seven Deadly Sins, instead.
Chaucer’s Retraction
Chaucer appeals to readers to credit Jesus Christ as the inspiration for anything in his book that they like, and to attribute what they don’t like to his own ignorance and lack of ability. He retracts and prays for forgiveness for all of his works dealing with secular and pagan subjects, asking only to be remembered for what he has written of saints’ lives and homilies."
Wilderness,"Into the Wild contains two interconnected plots, one that involves directly represented action and another that involves the careful development of a psychological portrait of Christopher McCandless. The first plot tracks McCandless’s journey into the wild, while the second tracks the development of Krakauer’s, and, implicitly, the reader’s, understanding of McCandless’s character and motivations. Neither plot is presented in linear fashion, and the two often intersect through the presentation of subtle detail, description, and the elaboration of multiple possible lines of cause and effect. Krakauer serves as the narrator throughout the book.
Into the Wild begins with the discovery of Christopher McCandless’s body by a group of Alaskan hunters who visit Denali National Park and Preserve on a yearly excursion. They radio for help. The FBI arrives and removes the body. Krakauer then visits with Wayne Westerberg, who knew Christopher McCandless as “Alex McCandless” and who provides an initial character sketch of the young man, Krakauer in a bar in Carthage, Wisconsin. Westerberg employed McCandless on and off on his grain elevator and remembers him as engaging, intelligent, and determined. Details from McCandless’s comfortable, middle-class Virginia upbringing and his dislike of materialism further Krakauer’s understanding of the young man. These same details take the narrator back to the first leg of McCandless’s journey west in his used yellow Datsun.
Just after graduating from college, McCandless drives to Lake Mead in Nevada, where a flashflood wets the engine of the Datsun. He leaves it and a number of other possessions behind. After two months of tramping, he buys a canoe on impulse and paddles down the Colorado River to Mexico. The journey takes five months. In the meantime, the McCandless family begins investigating their son’s disappearance. After his canoeing excursion, McCandless lives and works in Bullhead City, Arizona. An old man named Charlie takes him in briefly, before McCandless departs and meets Jan Buress and her old boyfriend in California. He engages in the social life of Buress’s drifters’ camp but leaves hastily, intending to embark on his trip to Alaska. Krakauer receives a letter from and then meets Ronald Franz, who describes to Krakauer the father-son relationship he established with McCandless. The narrator uses Franz’s story to initiate a line of investigation into the harm McCandless’s risk-taking behavior caused others.
Krakauer next visits Wayne Westerberg again and reconstructs McCandless’s last month in Carthage, South Dakota by speaking with Westerberg’s girlfriend and his mother. He acquires insight into McCandless’s troubled relationship with his father and relates that in late April, 1992, McCandless sent his friends postcards revealing that he was leaving for the wild, perhaps never to return. Krakauer’s investigation then move through his revelation that many readers of his original Outdoor magazine article about McCandless thought that Christopher McCandless was an incompetent, romantic fool. In response, Krakauer embarks on the telling of the stories of three other twentieth century wilderness fanatics who disappeared or died in the wild. He evaluates each and decides that McCandless has the most in common the young artist Everett Ruess.
Back at the bus in Alaska, state troopers attempt to identify McCandless’s body. Jim Gallien reads about the finding of the corpse and then contacts the police, setting off a string of events that lead to the identification of the body. Krakauer next visits with McCandless’s family, beginning with his father, Walt McCandless, and his mother, Billie McCandless. Billie shows Krakauer photographs of Christopher’s childhood and Walt describes the heartbreak his son has caused the family. Krakauer’s investigation then picks up a new subject: McCandless’s frustration with his family. When McCandless graduated from high school, he went on a trip to California and discovered that his father had been a bigamist. Krakauer theorizes that McCandless’s anger at this long-kept family secret offers some motivation for his desire to leave his life behind.
Krakauer then dedicates two chapters to his own ascent of the Devils Thumb. These parallel the plot of McCandless’s journey. Krakauer attempts the glacier’s north face and is rebuffed, then spends three days trapped at his base camp. After accidentally setting his tent on fire, he makes a desperate attempt at the southeast face and succeeds. Recalling this story allows Krakauer conclude that Christopher McCandless must not have been suicidal when he began his trip.
Jon Krakauer’s own trip to Denali National Park and the abandoned bus where McCandless died closes out the narrative. Along with three experienced Alaskans, Krakauer crosses the same river whose flooding prevented McCandless from leaving the wild. The four hikers encounter the bus in the late evening and examine its contents. Everything seems to have been as McCandless left it. The party eats dinner and reflects on the circumstances that could have led McCandless to head into the wild. In an epilogue, the author visits the bus again with Walt and Billie McCandless, Christopher McCandless’s mother and father."
Guaranteed,"Euripedes' Medea opens in a state of conflict. Jason has abandoned his wife, Medea, along with their two children. He hopes to advance his station by remarrying with Glauce, the daughter of Creon, king of Corinth, the Greek city where the play is set. All the events of play proceed out of this initial dilemma, and the involved parties become its central characters.
Outside the royal palace, a nurse laments the events that have lead to the present crisis. After a long series of trials and adventures, which ultimately forced Jason and Medea to seek exile in Corinth, the pair had settled down and established their family, achieving a degree of fame and respectability. Jason's recent abandonment of that family has crushed Medea emotionally, to the degree that she curses her own existence, as well as that of her two children.
Fearing a possible plot of revenge, Creon banishes Medea and her children from the city. After pleading for mercy, Medea is granted one day before she must leave, during which she plans to complete her quest for ""justice""--at this stage in her thinking, the murder of Creon, Glauce, and Jason. Jason accuses Medea of overreacting. By voicing her grievances so publicly, she has endangered her life and that of their children. He claims that his decision to remarry was in everyone's best interest. Medea finds him spineless, and she refuses to accept his token offers of help.
Appearing by chance in Corinth, Aegeus, King of Athens, offers Medea sanctuary in his home city in exchange for her knowledge of certain drugs that can cure his sterility. Now guaranteed an eventual haven in Athens, Medea has cleared all obstacles to completing her revenge, a plan which grows to include the murder of her own children; the pain their loss will cause her does not outweigh the satisfaction she will feel in making Jason suffer.
For the balance of the play, Medea engages in a ruse; she pretends to sympathize with Jason (bringing him into her confidence) and offers his wife ""gifts,"" a coronet and dress. Ostensibly, the gifts are meant to convince Glauce to ask her father to allow the children to stay in Corinth. The coronet and dress are actually poisoned, however, and their delivery causes Glauce's death. Seeing his daughter ravaged by the poison, Creon chooses to die by her side by dramatically embracing her and absorbing the poison himself.
A messenger recounts the gruesome details of these deaths, which Medea absorbs with cool attentiveness. Her earlier state of anxiety, which intensified as she struggled with the decision to commit infanticide, has now given way to an assured determination to fulfill her plans. Against the protests of the chorus, Medea murders her children and flees the scene in a dragon-pulled chariot provided by her grandfather, the Sun-God. Jason is left cursing his lot; his hope of advancing his station by abandoning Medea and marrying Glauce, the conflict which opened the play, has been annihilated, and everything he values has been lost through the deaths that conclude the tragedy."
Bay,"King Hrothgar of Denmark, a descendant of the great king Shield Sheafson, enjoys a prosperous and successful reign. He builds a great mead-hall, called Heorot, where his warriors can gather to drink, receive gifts from their lord, and listen to stories sung by the scops, or bards. But the jubilant noise from Heorot angers Grendel, a horrible demon who lives in the swamplands of Hrothgar’s kingdom. Grendel terrorizes the Danes every night, killing them and defeating their efforts to fight back. The Danes suffer many years of fear, danger, and death at the hands of Grendel. Eventually, however, a young Geatish warrior named Beowulf hears of Hrothgar’s plight. Inspired by the challenge, Beowulf sails to Denmark with a small company of men, determined to defeat Grendel.
Hrothgar, who had once done a great favor for Beowulf’s father Ecgtheow, accepts Beowulf’s offer to fight Grendel and holds a feast in the hero’s honor. During the feast, an envious Dane named Unferth taunts Beowulf and accuses him of being unworthy of his reputation. Beowulf responds with a boastful description of some of his past accomplishments. His confidence cheers the Danish warriors, and the feast lasts merrily into the night. At last, however, Grendel arrives. Beowulf fights him unarmed, proving himself stronger than the demon, who is terrified. As Grendel struggles to escape, Beowulf tears the monster’s arm off. Mortally wounded, Grendel slinks back into the swamp to die. The severed arm is hung high in the mead-hall as a trophy of victory.
Overjoyed, Hrothgar showers Beowulf with gifts and treasure at a feast in his honor. Songs are sung in praise of Beowulf, and the celebration lasts late into the night. But another threat is approaching. Grendel’s mother, a swamp-hag who lives in a desolate lake, comes to Heorot seeking revenge for her son’s death. She murders Aeschere, one of Hrothgar’s most trusted advisers, before slinking away. To avenge Aeschere’s death, the company travels to the murky swamp, where Beowulf dives into the water and fights Grendel’s mother in her underwater lair. He kills her with a sword forged for a giant, then, finding Grendel’s corpse, decapitates it and brings the head as a prize to Hrothgar. The Danish countryside is now purged of its treacherous monsters.
The Danes are again overjoyed, and Beowulf’s fame spreads across the kingdom. Beowulf departs after a sorrowful goodbye to Hrothgar, who has treated him like a son. He returns to Geatland, where he and his men are reunited with their king and queen, Hygelac and Hygd, to whom Beowulf recounts his adventures in Denmark. Beowulf then hands over most of his treasure to Hygelac, who, in turn, rewards him.
In time, Hygelac is killed in a war against the Shyflings, and, after Hygelac’s son dies, Beowulf ascends to the throne of the Geats. He rules wisely for fifty years, bringing prosperity to Geatland. When Beowulf is an old man, however, a thief disturbs a barrow, or mound, where a great dragon lies guarding a horde of treasure. Enraged, the dragon emerges from the barrow and begins unleashing fiery destruction upon the Geats. Sensing his own death approaching, Beowulf goes to fight the dragon. With the aid of Wiglaf, he succeeds in killing the beast, but at a heavy cost. The dragon bites Beowulf in the neck, and its fiery venom kills him moments after their encounter. The Geats fear that their enemies will attack them now that Beowulf is dead. According to Beowulf’s wishes, they burn their departed king’s body on a huge funeral pyre and then bury him with a massive treasure in a barrow overlooking the sea."
Nullify,"Lawyer Bryan Stevenson gives a first-person account of his decades helping marginalized Americans who have been unfairly and harshly punished by the U.S. criminal justice system, which disproportionately targets people of color and poor people. At the heart of Just Mercy is the story of Walter McMillian, a Black man who was framed for the murder of a girl named Ronda Morrison, convicted, and sent to death row. 
Stevenson alternates chapters about Walter with his personal reflections on our country’s history with racial disparity and issues around incarceration. Stevenson highlights other groups of vulnerable people who have been victimized by the criminal justice system and shares the stories of the prisoners he has helped over the years. The book also follows the growth of Stevenson’s nonprofit law project, the Alabama-based Equal Justice Initiative (EJI), through its expansion from focusing on death row prisoners to helping people sentenced to life without parole. Stevenson chronicles how EJI becomes a significant force in criminal justice reform.
In 1983 as a law student, Stevenson discovers his life’s passion when he interns with the Georgia-based Southern Prisoners Defense Committee and meets his first death row prisoner. After graduation Stevenson accepts a job with the organization to represent poor prisoners, including those in Alabama who lack any public defender. He meets Walter McMillian on Alabama’s death row. Walter owns a successful business but also transgresses racial boundaries when he has an affair with a white woman. Soon after the affair becomes public, the woman’s friend, Ralph Myers, accuses Walter of committing the unsolved murder of Ronda Morrison, which has outraged the community. Law enforcement, including a racist sheriff and the district attorney, eagerly pounces on this accusation, overlooking Walter’s alibi and a lack of evidence. Instead, they actively force Ralph to stick with his story even when he tries to recant. They coerce other false witness testimonies, and—as revealed years later—actively suppress evidence.
After Stevenson and the team at EJI unsuccessfully appeal Walter’s conviction, they launch their own investigation of the crime and uncover new evidence. They find witnesses who can prove the witnesses against Walter lied as well as financial records that indicate that one of these witnesses was paid to give false testimony. Stevenson and his team also petition for and receive all records from Walter’s trial. However, their big break comes when they receive a phone call from Ralph, who now wants to make amends. Ralph admits to lying about Walter and says he was threatened by law enforcement. Stevenson wins a hearing for Walter where he can present his new evidence: Ralph’s testimony, which is confirmed by health care workers and other inmates, as well as recordings of the law enforcement team threatening Ralph if he doesn’t frame Walter. 
While the judge refuses to grant Walter relief, Stevenson continues the appeal process through the Alabama courts. The district attorney asks outside agents to investigate the murder for which Walter was convicted, and the investigators determine that Walter had nothing to do with the crime. Six weeks later, the court invalidates Walter’s conviction. Stevenson and the State file a joint motion to dismiss the charges, and Walter is set free.
Throughout the process, Stevenson and Walter become close friends, and Stevenson helps Walter upon his release, including filing a civil suit on his behalf and offering him a place to stay. Walter works with Stevenson to share his story, giving interviews and speaking at legal conferences, and Walter is even featured in a documentary. Unfortunately, Walter is diagnosed with advancing dementia and is forced to rely on family and eventually a nursing facility for his care. He dies in 2013. Stevenson gives a eulogy at his funeral and shares all he learned from Walter, particularly that we must extend mercy to everyone, even those who have not earned it.
Interspersed with chapters chronicling Walter’s narrative are stories of Stevenson’s other clients and work. His closeness with these prisoners and their horrifying circumstances makes Stevenson more determined to help and causes him to reflect on abstract issues that nevertheless imbue the criminal justice system, like humanity and mercy. Stevenson focuses on several categories of vulnerable people who become trapped in the system, including mentally ill prisoners, disabled prisoners, and poor women who give birth to stillborn babies. 
Stevenson and his team at EJI also become increasingly focused on juvenile offenders who are sometimes tried as adults despite their young age. These offenders may be given de facto death sentences by being sentenced to life without parole and face perilous circumstances when they are housed in adult prisons. Stevenson illustrates how these prisoners retain their own humanity while being forced to live under inhumane conditions. He also discusses some of the qualities common among these types of prisoners: They are generally poor and disproportionately people of color, and most of them lack adequate legal counsel. The juveniles have horrific backgrounds of abuse and neglect.
Stevenson and his team at EJI also work to change the legal system to offer more protection to marginalized people. Several of his cases end up before the U.S. Supreme Court, and he succeeds in winning rulings that ban as unconstitutional the conviction of children to life without parole and the execution of people deemed incompetent from dementia or neurological disease. EJI works to raise public awareness of issues surrounding unfair incarceration, produces groundbreaking reports on racial issues, and sets up programs to help formerly incarcerated people adjust to life on the outside.
Stevenson also reflects on the issues that surround the criminal justice system. His time spent with prisoners awaiting their execution makes him realize how inhumane it is to prepare another human to die. After decades of work, when Stevenson fails to prevent the execution of a man who suffers from an intellectual disability, he momentarily feels unable to continue his work. However, he realizes that he cannot help but be broken by his experiences and comes to understand that it is his own brokenness that allows him to more fully understand the need for mercy and to bring compassion to others. The book ends with Stevenson’s renewed commitment to helping others."
Took,"Kidnapped tells the story of David Balfour, a young man of the Lowlands, the southern part of Scotland. David's father, Alexander Balfour, has recently died, and his mother died some time before, so he is now an orphan. Since he is now seventeen years old, he has decided it is time to go and seek his fortune. Before he leaves for the city of Edinburgh, he meets with his guardian, Mr. Campbell. Campbell reveals that David has an uncle, Ebenezer Balfour, of the House of Shaws—meaning that David is, to his surprise, from a wealthy family. David decides to go to Cramond, where his uncle lives, and meet his wealthy relatives.
David walks two days to Edinburgh, and soon finds his way to Cramond. As he begins to ask about the House of Shaws, he finds it is an unpopular place. His Uncle Ebenezer seems particularly ill regarded by the community, and is in fact the only occupant of the house. Nevertheless, David continues on to the House of Shaws. Ebenezer gives him a cold welcome, and seems very interested in the death of David's father. Ebenezer treats David badly, almost as if David were a thief, but he wins some of David's respect by giving the lad nearly forty pounds. But when Ebenezer nearly sends David to his death in the tower adjacent to the house, David demands to know why his uncle hates him and, if he does, why he wants him to stay at the House of Shaws.
A cabin boy, Ransome, arrives at the House of Shaws. He has been sent by Captain Hoseason of the Covenant, a ship that deals with some of Ebenezer's financial ventures. Hoseason has requested to see Ebenezer, so the old man decides to go to the port of Queensferry with Ransome and David. David is interested in seeing the ships at the port, so he willingly goes along. At first, Hoseason seems very pleasant. He even warns David that Ebenezer means mischief toward him. Hoseason then asks to speak to David on the boat, and David agrees, being interested in seeing more of the boat. Once he is on, however, the boat swiftly departs, and as he screams at the dock for help, the sailors knock David unconscious.
He awakes in the dark storage deck of the Covenant. As he drifts in and out of sleep, he quickly becomes ill, and soon he is lingering near death. The ship's mate, Riach, demands that the boy be allowed to sleep in the healthier forecastle of the ship with the other sailors. Hoseason reluctantly agrees, and as David recovers he becomes friends with Riach and a few of the other sailors. Then, Ransome is accidentally killed by Mr. Shuan, and David becomes the new cabin boy.
After a few days at this new job, the Covenant strikes and sinks another boat. One man survives, a strange Highland man dressed in the clothing of a French soldier. The stranger tells the captain that he is carrying the rent money for his disenfranchised chieftain. The two men make an agreement that Hoseason will drop the stranger off in Linnhe Loch, but no sooner is the captain gone from the Round-House—the officers' lounge where the visiting stranger is kept—when David overhears the officers plotting to murder the stranger and take his belt. David tells this to the stranger, and agrees to fight by his side. The stranger says his name is Alan Breck Stewart. Alan and David successfully defend the Round-House from the sailors, Alan killing several men and even David taking two himself. Alan, impressed with David's courage, gives David a silver button from his coat. The captain and Alan negotiate, and the captain agrees to drop Alan and David off near Linnhe Loch.
On the way, however, the ship strikes the Torran Rocks and goes down. David escapes and finds himself on an island. The island is separated from a larger main island only by a river, but he can find no way to cross the river. After a few days, a fisherman comes in a boat and reveals to him that the river gets very low at high tide, and David crosses easily.
David then stays at a house, and discovers that Alan himself passed through, having survived the wreck. Alan left instructions that David should follow him to Torosay, and from there go to Alan's homeland of Appin. David heads this way, meeting several disreputable people along the way, including a notorious blind robber; but the young man manages to avoid any great dangers. He meets a pleasant old religious instructor, Henderland, who helps David secure a boat to take him to Appin.
As soon as David arrives in Appin, he comes across a group of four men on horseback. One of the men is Colin Campbell, the King's Regent for that area, whose clan, the Campbells, are hated by Alan and his Stewart clan. As David speaks with Campbell, he is suddenly shot and killed by an unknown assailant. One of the people in Campbell's party accuses David of distracting Campbell so that he could be shot, and just as soldiers are about to apprehend David he is pulled away by Alan, who has been fishing nearby.
Alan and David, now major suspects in the murder, flee to the woods. Alan swears he had nothing to do with the murder, but he must now draw attention away from the real killer. David believes Alan, and they escape to the home of James Stewart, or James of the Glens. James gives them a change of clothes and some little money, but he tells them that he will have to blame them for the murder and put our warrants for their arrest once they are safely gone, so that he will not be blamed for the murder. If James is killed, it will mean great difficulties for the Stewart clan. David and Alan agree to be the scapegoats, and Alan and David are soon fleeing through the wilderness once more.
They hide for a whole day on top of a large rock while English soldiers roam around below, searching for them. They escape and go to a mountain where they rest for several days and send word to James, hoping to get a little more money so that Alan can escape to France. The messenger returns with a note from James' wife; James has been arrested for the murder. She also sends a little more money for David and Alan.
The two continue on their flight, soon reaching the broad, flat region known as the moors. They take some time out to rest, but David oversleeps on his watch, and a troop of English soldiers nearly takes them by surprise. They must run through the wide, flat land on their hands and knees, hiding in small brush and behind rocks. They manage to escape and are ambushed by Highland men who, fortunately, turn out to be men of Cluny Macpherson, another disenfranchised Highland leader. Cluny takes them in his hideout in the mountain of Ben Alder, and while David sleeps for nearly three days, Alan and Cluny play cards. Alan gambles away all their money, including David's. Cluny agrees to give them their money back, plus more, but Cluny is mortified that they thought he would keep the money, David is angry that Alan gambled it away and he has to swallow his pride and ask for it back, and Alan feels guilty for having gambled it all away.
Alan and David continue on their journey toward the Lowlands, but David is now angry and bitter toward Alan. Alan feels remorseful for some time, but when David refuses to warm up at all, Alan thinks that he has personally suffered enough, and soon becomes his usual happy self, taunting David for being a Whig. Alan is a Jacobite, someone who believed the Stuarts, a Highland clan, should be on the throne, whereas Whigs were supporters of the current English monarchy, following the line of William and Mary. David's patience wears thin, and he viciously attacks Alan's honor. Realizing he cannot be forgiven for what he said, David pretends that he is about to die of exhaustion, and Alan becomes very worried and takes David to a house.
Over the course of a month, David recovers. There is some brief trouble when Alan meets Robin Oig, one of the sons of the well-known Highlander Rob Roy Macgregor, who was also a Campbell. But instead of using guns, they duel by playing the bagpipes, and the two men quickly respect one another and a crisis is averted.
David and Alan finally move on and, after some difficulties, reach Queensferry once more. They cross over and David meets with his family's lawyer, Mr. Rankeillor. Rankeillor believes his story, but David's uncle Ebenezer must be dealt with somehow. It turns out that Ebenezer and David's father had had a dispute over a woman, David's mother. They had finally come to an agreement—David's father married his mother, and Ebenezer took the estate and the Balfour fortune, although he was not the elder brother. Rankeillor says the agreement is not legally binding, and that David is the true heir of the estate. But David does not want the House of Shaws, just a pension from its yearly earnings.
To rectify the situation, David plays a trick on Ebenezer. Rankeillor, David, and Alan go to the House of Shaws. Alan walks up to the door alone, and pretends that he is from a bunch of Highlanders who found David alive shortly after the shipwreck on the Torran Rocks. He asks for money to return to the boy, but Ebenezer refuses to pay anything. Alan then says that they'll kill him unless Ebenezer pays to have him kept alive. Ebenezer does not want the boy dead, and as he haggles over how much he will pay he admits that the plan had been for Hoseason to sell the boy into slavery in the Carolinas. At that point, David and Rankeillor reveal themselves, having caught Ebenezer in the confession. Ebenezer and Rankeillor then work out an agreement that David would get two-thirds of the yearly income of the House of Shaws.
David receives a note from Rankeillor that will allow him to collect his money. David then speaks to Alan, and arranges to send him money so that Alan can get passage to France. The two men part, and David wanders into town to claim his fortune."
Republic,"Far into the future, the United States has been rocked by floods and a volcanic eruption that caused massive destruction. In the wake of these apocalyptic events, a new Republic has formed. This Republic is a totalitarian state run by a dictator named Elector Primo. A dissenting faction, the Colonies, has also formed, which resists the Republic’s rule. Day is the Republic’s most wanted criminal. He is a fifteen-year-old boy from the poor Lake sector outside of Los Angeles. After failing the Republic’s “Trial,” a grueling test every child takes at the age of ten which determines their educational and economic future, and being subjected to painful medical tests while in a labor camp, Day decides to live a life of crime against the state. He is known for torching fighter jets, vandalizing public buildings, and stealing from banks. Day, only fifteen years old, is very clever and has managed to elude capture for several years—the Republic doesn’t even know what Day looks like. Even though it would be safer for Day to stay outside the city, he remains close to his family’s home to keep watch over his two brothers, John and Eden, and their mother. On the other side of town is June, a fifteen-year-old prodigy who was born to wealthy parents. She is the only student known to have gotten a perfect 1500 on the Trial. June, cocky and self-assured, awaits graduation from Drake, one of the nation’s top schools. She’s in line to become one of the Republic’s premier citizens. 
One day, June learns that her brother, Metias, a military captain for the Republic, has been murdered. Metias’s friend and military colleague, Thomas, comes to break the news to June. He tells her that Metias was murdered during a break-in at a local hospital while during rounds. Everyone suspects Day is the killer since he was the one who committed the break-in. Day was searching for plague cures for his family. Cures are expensive and inaccessible to the poor, who have to pay for medical care, unlike the wealthy, who receive free care. When June arrives at the scene of her brother’s murder, Commander Jameson, a hardline official, informs June that she’s being promoted to officer right on the spot, and her first assignment will be to investigate her brother’s murder. June swallows her emotions, puts on a brave face, and stoically assumes the role. After examining her brother’s body, however, she vows to avenge his death and hunt down his murderer. Meanwhile, Day, who managed to escape the hospital with only an injured leg, doesn’t know if he killed Metias. Day, who is known for not murdering his hostages, only recalls throwing the knife at a soldier, being careful to not kill him. Day is nursed back to health by Tess, a younger orphan he took under his wing when he found her scavenging for food on the streets. Day and Tess take care of each other.
June goes undercover to find Day, whom she is convinced killed her brother. While undercover, she stumbles upon a Skiz fight, a type of street fight where gamblers take bets on random fighters. June is inadvertently brought into the ring when she intervenes to help Tess, who is challenged to a fight. Although June doesn’t know Tess, she sees that Tess is too thin and fragile to compete, and could easily get killed. When June wins the fight but refuses to pick another opponent, the angry gamblers chase after her. Day, who is waiting for Tess outside the ring, throws a dust bomb to disperse the crowd. Day decides to take June in, and he, Tess, and June become a unit wandering the streets together. Both Day and June are clever, intelligent, and perceptive. They try to hide their identities from each other because they don’t know who the other one is. After a few days, however, June pieces together that the boy who helped her is Day. She struggles with this realization, however, because Day has been so caring and protective of her. They’ve even grown attracted to each other.
Despite her attraction to Day, and her instinct that he is a good, caring person, June summons up the resolve to turn Day in. She alerts Thomas, who stages a capture at Day’s family’s home. June tells Day that the plague patrol is coming to his house to take a sick family member away. Day races toward his family’s home. He rushes inside the house to bring them to safety, shocking his mother, who believes he died in the labor camps years prior. It’s too late, however. The soldiers come and outnumber him. Day starts sling-shotting bullets at the soldiers out of desperation. Commander Jameson, impatient to draw Day out, orders Thomas to shoot Day’s mother on the spot. Destroyed and distraught, Day and the rest of his family are captured and brought to the military’s headquarters.
June is put in charge of guarding and interrogating Day, who is sentenced to be executed. The more she questions him, however, the more she begins to doubt that Day is the one who killed her brother. Day tells her that the Republic doesn’t send kids to labor camps but kills them outright when they fail their Trials. He also tells her he suspects the Republic deliberately infects the poor sectors with the plague. One night, June reads her brother Metias’s journals. She remembers that the night before he died, he told her he needed to tell her something. In the journals, June finds a code to a secret website her brother created to give her the shocking news he found out: Their parents, whom they believe had died in a car crash, were murdered by the Republic, and Thomas found out that Metias knew about it. June realizes that it was Thomas who killed Metias, not Day, and the Republic is trying to cover it up.
June rushes back to Day’s cell. When Day reiterates that he didn’t kill her brother, she accepts his innocence and resolves to save him. June enlists the help of the Colonies’ rebel soldiers, the Patriots, who create a diversion that allows June, Day, and Day’s brothers—John and Eden—to escape. The ruse doesn’t work as planned, however. To buy them more time, John makes a fateful decision to switch himself with Day. Since Day is barely conscious after being beaten, Day isn’t able to stop him. John wears a hood and walks onto a stage where the Republic executes him. When Day comes to full consciousness, June assures him that his brother John wanted to sacrifice himself. Day, anguished, resolves to save both his brother Eden, who he now knows was deliberately infected with a new strain of the plague, and Tess, who has gone undercover with the Patriots. June, who now realizes Day is her only family, commits to helping him."
Another,"The Other Wes Moore: One Name, Two Fates tells the story of two Black men with the same name: Wes Moore. Both men grew up enduring similar hardships, but Moore, the author and narrator, was encouraged to overcome these difficulties and became successful, while Wes, his counterpart, found himself sentenced to life in prison for murder. Moore learns about Wes and, fascinated, writes him a letter, hoping to find out more about what led Wes to a life of incarceration. Moore receives a response from Wes and begins to visit him in prison, where the two share their stories.
In the first section of the book, the two men discuss the impact that the absence of their fathers had on their lives, and their stories alternate in each chapter. Moore introduces his mother, Joy; father, Westley; and sisters, Nikki and Shani. He details how his parents met and describes his father’s job as a radio journalist. When Moore was three years old, he watched his father become sick and die in front of him. 
Meanwhile, young Wes has never met his father, Bernard, who was an alcoholic, but loved spending time with his father’s mother, Mamie. One day, Wes’s mother, Mary, learns that her funding to go to college has been taken away, and her dream to get her degree crumbles. That night, Mary has plans with friends, so she drops young Wes off at Mamie’s for the night. When Wes arrives at Mamie’s, he sees a drunk man—Bernard—on Mamie’s couch. When Bernard asks Mary who the kid is, Mary introduces Wes to his father.
Several years later, Wes and his friend Woody go the park, where they meet up with a group of boys to play football. The game turns aggressive, and another boy punches Wes. Wes runs home and grabs a knife. He returns to the park and runs after the boy, but the police arrive and arrest Wes. He is eight years old. 
Around this time, Moore’s widowed mother, Joy, unable to raise her children alone any longer, has moved her family to the Bronx to live with her parents. To keep Moore off the street, she sends Moore to Riverdale, a private school. She works three jobs to pay the tuition. Moore feels alienated. He doesn’t fit in at Riverdale, and the neighborhood kids tease him for attending a white school. When Moore’s grades slip, Joy threatens to send him to military school. 
Wes admires and envies his older brother Tony. Tony is very protective of Wes. Tony deals drugs, has a formidable reputation, and always seems to wear expensive, stylish clothes. Hoping to earn money like Tony, Wes becomes a lookout for a local drug dealer. He later starts dealing drugs himself.
In the next section of the book, Moore and Wes discuss maturity and second chances. Once again, their stories alternate in each chapter. At age fifteen, Wes makes his money selling drugs. When Tony asks Wes how he can afford so many pairs of sneakers, Wes lies and says he works as a DJ. Tony knows he’s being dishonest, attacks him, and then tells Mary that Wes sells drugs. Mary finds drugs in Wes’s room and flushes them down the toilet. Wes feels angry about the situation but vows to make up the $4,000 he lost. 
In the Bronx, Moore continues to do poorly in school. The police catch him tagging a building with his friend Shea, who has started running drugs. Shea is obstinate toward the police, but Moore feels terrified. The police let the boys off with a warning. A year later, Moore finds himself on academic probation at Riverdale, so Joy sends him to military school. At first, Moore displays an attitude and defies his commander, Sergeant Anderson. At one point, Anderson gives Moore a map with directions to the nearest bus station, encouraging Moore to leave. The directions are fake, however, and Moore becomes lost in the woods. When Anderson finds Moore in the woods, he brings him to Colonel Batt, who allows Moore to call home for five minutes. The next day, Moore is impressed by the discipline of F Company, and Colonel Batt suggests he talks to its commander, Cadet Captain Ty Hill.
In Maryland, Wes meets Alicia, who quickly becomes pregnant. Wes soon begins dating a new girl, however, and one night, as the girl leaves Wes’s apartment, her boyfriend, Ray, is waiting outside. Ray yells at the girl and attacks Wes, who runs inside and grabs a gun. Wes and some of his crew chase Ray and shoot him. Wes is arrested soon after. He spends six months in juvenile detention for the crime.
Three years later, Wes has dropped out of school and is selling drugs full-time. One day, a suspicious man approaches Wes, asking for drugs. Wes turns the man away at first but then decides to take a chance. However, the man is an undercover cop, and Wes is arrested again. 
Meanwhile, Moore thrives in military school, where he wins academic and athletic scholarships. One day, Moore and a friend walk into town for food. While they are walking, a group of boys in a car accost them, shout racial slurs, and hit Moore in the head with a bottle. Moore and his friend find their way back to campus through the same woods where Moore once got lost. He reflects on how much has changed for him over the past few years.
In the third section of the book, Moore and Wes discuss how other people’s expectations have shaped their lives. While in a plane during his paratrooper training, Moore contemplates how much his life has changed and considers how he now sees every moment of life as precious. 
In Baltimore, Wes, now the father of four, tries to change his life and goes to Job Corps for vocational training. There, he is encouraged by his teachers and peers and finds success. However, after graduating, Wes struggles to pay his bills and turns to selling drugs again.
Three years later, Wes and Tony rob a jewelry store. As they escape, one of them shoots and kills the security guard, Sergeant Prothero. The police find and arrest them in Philadelphia. Tony pleads guilty and receives a life sentence. Wes pleads innocent and goes to trial, where he is convicted and also sentenced to life in prison. 
During this time, Moore works as an intern for Baltimore’s Mayor Schmoke, who encourages Moore to apply for a Rhodes Scholarship. Moore receives a grant and spends a semester in South Africa, where he witnesses true poverty and the impact of apartheid. At the same time, Moore learns how young Black men in South Africa are encouraged and celebrated, rather than feared, and decides to dedicate himself to a life of service."
Land,"Paul-Edward Logan is born on a plantation in Georgia to a white man and his black mistress, a former slave. He has three white brothers—two who are older and one who his own age—and one black sister. His father is a fair-minded man, and when Paul is little, he sees little difference between his life and the lives of his brothers, especially the youngest brother, Robert, who is his best friend. Throughout his childhood, Paul, who is only one-quarter black and can pass as white, is tormented by the black children who live on the plantation, especially a boy named Mitchell. Eventually, Paul strikes a deal with Mitchell: Paul will teach Mitchell how to read and write, and Mitchell will teach Paul how to fight. Their alliance is sealed when Paul takes the blame for Mitchell, who rides and injures one of Paul's father's best horses. Shortly thereafter, Paul's father sends Paul to learn furniture making in Macon, and he sends Robert to a boy's school in Savannah. The two brothers, now immersed in separate worlds, begin to grow apart. This distance creates a developing rift, especially when Paul fights Robert and two of his white friends because they have beaten and hurt one of the family's horses. As a result, Paul's father whips Paul severely, not for fighting the boys, but for standing up to and striking white men.
Several years later, Paul and Mitchell accompany Paul's father to a horse fair in east Texas. Paul is an excellent rider, and a man, whose jockey is ill, asks Paul to ride in a horse race. When Paul's father does not permit him to race, Paul disobeys his father, partially because he feels his father has a double standard about kinship. Paul wins the race but must flee on a train with Mitchell, both to escape his father's wrath and because Mitchell took money from the horse owner that should have gone to Paul. The two young men work as horsemen on a farm in Mississippi and then work in a lumbering camp. In the lumbering camp, the boss, Jessup, resents Paul, who looks like a white man. Eventually, the pair leaves the lumbering camp in search of a better life, and the two part ways. Paul ends up in Vicksburg, where he makes furniture for a friendly white storeowner. Paul carefully saves his money, determined to buy a tract of land south of Vicksburg. He meets an attractive and saucy young girl, Caroline, while making a rocker for her mother. He thinks about asking to court her, but before he can muster the nerve, he discovers that Caroline is betrothed to his dear friend Mitchell, who works at a lumbering camp nearby.
Impatient to begin his life as a landowner, Paul makes a deal with a miserly white man, Filmore Granger, to clear forty acres of timberland for the man in exchange for ownership of the forty acres. Though this is not the land Paul wants to own, he hopes he can sell it later to buy the land he really desires. Mitchell agrees to work with Paul in exchange for a share of the land. Mitchell and Caroline get married, and the three begin a happy but demanding life that consists of clearing trees from the land. They are occasionally harassed, particularly by a poor white man named Digger Wallace, a worthless drunk. Finally, the land Paul dreams of owning goes on sale, and Paul stakes everything he has to buy 200 acres. Just after he makes the deal, however, Digger Wallace shoots and kills Mitchell. Paul and Caroline work desperately, selling off their belongings one by one to make payments on the 200 acres. When Granger rescinds his deal and seizes ownership of the forty acres, Paul and Caroline are ready to surrender. Just before they must leave the forty acres and foreclose on the 200, Robert appears with a letter from Paul's sister, Cassie. Inside the letter is Paul's inheritance from his mother and money that Cassie had saved—more than enough to pay for the land. Paul and Caroline get married and move onto the 200 acres together."
Forbearers,"N. Scott Momaday, a poet and novelist of Kiowa descent, learns that his grandmother, Aho, has died. She is buried near Rainy Mountain, Oklahoma, and Momaday wants to visit her grave. He decides to make the journey the long way—by following the ancient migration route of the Kiowas, from their original homeland near the headwaters of the Yellowstone River east to the Black Hills and then south to Oklahoma. During this migration, the Kiowas had acquired horses and the Sun Dance religion. Their warrior society once dominated the southern Great Plains. 
As Momaday follows his ancestors’ journey, he recounts oral histories passed on to him by his parents and grandparents. He collects pieces of historical information, records his own impressions and memories, and composes poems. He arranges these diverse materials to form a narrative wheel, in which the voice of Kiowa oral tradition, the voice of historical commentary, and the personal voice of the author take turns telling stories of multiple journeys that form a single journey of the human spirit. Paintings by Al Momaday, the author’s father, illustrate key scenes from the Kiowas’ oral history.
The voice of oral tradition begins with the myth of how Kiowas enter the world through a hollow log. Although they must leave many of their people behind, they are happy with what they see. Sometime later, two of their chiefs argue over the udders of an antelope. One chief gets so angry that he takes his followers and leaves, never to be seen again. A talking dog agrees to help a man escape his enemies, and in return the man cares for her puppies.
A Kiowa woman hangs a little girl’s cradle in a tree. A redbird lures the child out of her cradle. As the girl climbs after the bird, the tree grows and carries her to the sky. There the sun is waiting to make her his wife. The girl weds the sun and has a child. Later, after arguing with her husband, the woman lowers a rope and climbs down, trying to reach her people. The angry sun throws a ring and kills his wife, leaving the child alone. A grandmother spider ensnares the sun’s child, a little boy, and raises him as her own son. The sun’s child keeps the ring that killed his mother. He tosses the ring toward the sky. The ring falls on him and splits him in two. Now grandmother spider must raise twins. She teaches them a sacred word that helps them escape evil giants. Then the twins kill a snake without realizing he is their grandfather. Heartbroken, the grandmother spider dies, but the twins live on for a long time.
The Kiowas suffer hard times, when food is scarce. A man is out looking for food when Tai-me (the sacred Sun Dance doll) appears, covered with feathers. She promises to give the Kiowas whatever they want. From this time on she will belong to the Kiowas. Another legend tells of two brothers who receive a mysterious gift of meat during a hungry winter. While one brother feels afraid of the meat, the other brother eats it and is transformed into a water beast.
Kiowa storytellers recite newer legends about their forebears and their life on the plains. They tell of a woman who saves her family by throwing hot grease at her enemies and of a skilled arrow maker who shoots his enemy right in the heart. They speak of how horses came to be and of terrible winds and storms. The elders relive the love story of the great warrior Quoetotai and one of the wives of Many Bears. They celebrate a buffalo with horns of steel—and the hunter who kills him with one last perfect shot. One tale relates what happens to a wife who abandons her husband. Another tale tells of some young men who ride south to find the homeland of the sun and of the spooky events that made them return to their homes and their life of hunting buffalo.
The Kiowas also tell of two brothers who are captured by the Utes. The Ute chief offers freedom if one brother can carry the other over a path of greased buffalo heads. The Kiowa hero accomplishes the task. The elders also tell how a great horse dies of shame after its hunter shows fear.
The Kiowas recite stories about Mammedaty, the grandson of Guipahgo. Mammedaty has visions, such as his vision of a child in the grass. He also has a bad temper—he shoots a horse in anger. Aho, Momaday’s grandmother, joins the voices of the elders. She tells of the time the Tai-me bundle fell to the floor with a great noise. Momaday, the author, adds the tale of a beautifully dressed woman buried somewhere near the house of Mammedaty, his grandfather.
Momaday adds historical comments after each story in the Kiowas’ oral history. He explains that the name Kiowa contains the meaning of two different halves. Momaday describes Kiowa traditional dress, their hunting practices, their “dog societies” of skilled warriors, their skill with horses, their Sun Dance ceremony, which was centered on the sacred doll Tai-me, and their later peyote rituals. He also records key events in the decline and destruction of the Kiowas and their culture.
Momaday also adds comments in his own voice after each Kiowa story and historical comment. He describes the land and its living things—wildflowers, insects, and spiders—in intimate detail and records how places make him feel. Momaday adds memories of his grandmother, Aho; of his grandfather, Mammedaty; and of Mammedaty’s grandmother and other elders. He shares a final oral memory from Ko-sahn, a one-hundred-year-old woman. Ko-sahn remembers how, in her childhood, she helped get the lodge ready for the Sun Dance, how an old woman sprinkled special earth on the lodge floor, and how beautiful it was to watch the Sun Dance, which was all for Tai-me."
Unexpected,"Bilbo Baggins lives a quiet, peaceful life in his comfortable hole at Bag End. Bilbo lives in a hole because he is a hobbit—one of a race of small, plump people about half the size of humans, with furry toes and a great love of good food and drink. Bilbo is quite content at Bag End, near the bustling hobbit village of Hobbiton, but one day his comfort is shattered by the arrival of the old wizard Gandalf, who persuades Bilbo to set out on an adventure with a group of thirteen militant dwarves. The dwarves are embarking on a great quest to reclaim their treasure from the marauding dragon Smaug, and Bilbo is to act as their “burglar.” The dwarves are very skeptical about Gandalf’s choice for a burglar, and Bilbo is terrified to leave his comfortable life to seek adventure. But Gandalf assures both Bilbo and the dwarves that there is more to the little hobbit than meets the eye.
Shortly after the group sets out, three hungry trolls capture all of them except for Gandalf. Gandalf tricks the trolls into remaining outside when the sun comes up, and the sunlight turns the nocturnal trolls to stone. The group finds a great cache of weapons in the trolls’ camp. Gandalf and the dwarf lord Thorin take magic swords, and Bilbo takes a small sword of his own.
The group rests at the elfish stronghold of Rivendell, where they receive advice from the great elf lord Elrond, then sets out to cross the Misty Mountains. When they find shelter in a cave during a snowstorm, a group of goblins who live in the caverns beneath the mountain take them prisoner. Gandalf leads the dwarves to a passage out of the mountain, but they accidentally leave behind Bilbo.
Wandering through the tunnels, Bilbo finds a strange golden ring lying on the ground. He takes the ring and puts it in his pocket. Soon he encounters Gollum, a hissing, whining creature who lives in a pool in the caverns and hunts fish and goblins. Gollum wants to eat Bilbo, and the two have a contest of riddles to determine Bilbo’s fate. Bilbo wins by asking the dubious riddle, “What have I got in my pocket?”
Gollum wants to eat Bilbo anyway, and he disappears to fetch his magic ring, which turns its wearer invisible. The ring, however, is the same one Bilbo has already found, and Bilbo uses it to escape from Gollum and flee the goblins. He finds a tunnel leading up out of the mountain and discovers that the dwarves and Gandalf have already escaped. Evil wolves known as Wargs pursue them, but Bilbo and his comrades are helped to safety by a group of great eagles and by Beorn, a creature who can change shape from a man into a bear.
The company enters the dark forest of Mirkwood, and, making matters worse, Gandalf abandons them to see to some other urgent business. In the forest, the dwarves are caught in the webs of some giant spiders, and Bilbo must rescue them with his sword and magic ring. After slaying his first spider, Bilbo names his sword Sting. Shortly after escaping the spiders, the unlucky dwarves are captured by a group of wood elves who live near the river that runs through Mirkwood. Bilbo uses his ring to help the company escape and slips the dwarves away from the elves by hiding them inside barrels, which he then floats down the river. The dwarves arrive at Lake Town, a human settlement near the Lonely Mountain, under which the great dragon sleeps with Thorin’s treasure.
After sneaking into the mountain, Bilbo talks to the sly dragon Smaug, who unwittingly reveals that his armorlike scales have a weak spot near his heart. When Bilbo steals a golden cup from the dragon’s hoard, Smaug is furious and flies out of the mountain to burn Lake Town in his rage. Bard, a heroic archer, has learned the secret about Smaug’s weakness from a thrush, and he fires an arrow into the dragon’s heart, killing him. Before Smaug dies, however, he burns Lake Town to the ground. 
The humans of Lake Town and the elves of Mirkwood march to the Lonely Mountain to seek a share of the treasure as compensation for their losses and aid, but Thorin greedily refuses, and the humans and elves besiege the mountain, trapping the dwarves and the hobbit inside. Bilbo sneaks out to join the humans in an attempt to bring peace. When Thorin learns what Bilbo has done, he is livid, but Gandalf suddenly reappears and saves Bilbo from the dwarf lord’s wrath.
At this moment, an army of goblins and Wargs marches on the mountain, and the humans, elves, and dwarves are forced to band together to defeat them. The goblins nearly win, but the arrival of Beorn and the eagles helps the good armies win the battle.
After the battle, Bilbo and Gandalf return to Hobbiton, where Bilbo continues to live. He is no longer accepted by respectable hobbit society, but he does not care. Bilbo now prefers to talk to elves and wizards, and he is deeply content to be back among the familiar comforts of home after his grand and harrowing adventures."
Attaining,"Starr Carter, a sixteen-year-old black girl, attends a party in her neighborhood, Garden Heights. Starr goes with Kenya, a friend with whom she shares an older half-brother, Seven. Ever since attending Williamson Prep, a primarily white school, Starr feels out of place in the Garden Heights social scene. When Kenya goes off with other friends, Starr runs into her childhood best friend, Khalil Harris, whom she hasn’t seen in a long time. Gunshots from a gang fight interrupt the party, and Khalil offers to take Starr home. While Khalil drives, he explains rapper Tupac Shakur’s idea that “Thug Life” stands for “The Hate U Give Little Infants F---- Everybody.” Soon after, a white police officer with the badge number one-fifteen pulls them over. Khalil questions the motivation for the stop, and One-Fifteen orders him out of the car and searches him. One-Fifteen commands Khalil not to move, and returns to his car. Khalil opens the door to check on Starr. One-Fifteen fatally shoots Khalil.
Starr has nightmares about the death of another childhood friend, Natasha, who died in the crossfire of a gang shooting. At school on Monday, Starr feels tense around Hailey and Chris, her white friend and boyfriend, as memories of Khalil’s death interrupt her thoughts and she realizes they don’t understand. At the urging of her uncle Carlos, a police officer, Starr goes into the police station after school with her mother, Lisa, to testify about Khalil’s shooting. Starr realizes that the officers are asking more questions about whether Khalil was a troublemaker than about the night of the shooting. She worries that justice for Khalil will not be served. At Khalil’s funeral, a lawyer and activist named April Ofrah confirms Starr’s fears when she announces that the police will not pursue legal action against One-Fifteen and invites the attendees to a rally in Khalil’s honor. Starr blames herself for the police’s inaction. King, the head of a local gang called the King Lords, also interrupts the funeral and places a gray bandana on Khalil’s casket, signifying Khalil’s membership in the King Lords. April Ofrah tells Starr to call her if she needs legal representation.
The news that the police won’t prosecute One-Fifteen leads to days of protests in Garden Heights. During this time, Maverick, Starr’s father, explains to her his interpretation of Tupac’s phrase “Thug Life.” He believes that Thug Life describes a system designed against black communities. Only by speaking out can black communities begin to break the cycle. At the Carter family’s grocery store, a teenage member of the King Lords named DeVante begs Maverick, a former King Lord, to help him leave the gang. Maverick agrees. Starr sees DeVante’s request as a chance to help someone in a similar situation as Khalil. A few days later, Maverick gets into an argument with the neighborhood barber, Mr. Lewis. Although the argument is peaceful, two police officers intervene, and when they see Maverick is Starr’s father, they push him to the ground and search him. Between this scary event and pressure from Kenya, Starr decides that she will no longer be silent.
The District Attorney calls Lisa to announce that a grand jury will hear the case against One-Fifteen and asks if Starr will testify. Starr agrees, and April Ofrah decides to represent Starr pro bono, and also find a way to get Starr a television interview. Meanwhile, DeVante tells Starr that Khalil had never been a member of the King Lords and only sold drugs for King to protect his mother, who had stolen money from King. During Starr’s television interview, she decides, against Ms. Ofrah’s advice, to talk about the truth behind Khalil’s drug dealing. Starr’s implication of King enrages him. The night before her grand jury testimony, someone throws a brick and fires a gun into the Carter household. Unsure if the culprits are the King Lords or the police, Starr almost backs out of testifying. However, she ultimately decides that Khalil needs her truth. She testifies before the grand jury.
Almost two months later, the grand jury announces their decision not to indict One-Fifteen. Starr and some of her friends get caught up in the resulting riots. As she tries to avoid the chaos, Starr stumbles upon a protest led by Ms. Ofrah. She offers Starr the megaphone, and Starr leads a chant in front of the protest. The police try to break up the protest with tear gas. Starr and her friends head to the Carter family store to get milk to help heal their eyes. A Molotov cocktail lands in the store, setting it ablaze and trapping them. Maverick arrives just in time to unlock the back door. King arrives to taunt them, proud about getting his revenge. The police arrive, and King, confident that no one will testify against him, claims ignorance. However, the neighbors rally around the Carter family and tell the police that they saw King throw the Molotov cocktail. The police arrest King. Although the grocery store is in ruins, Starr knows that the family will rebuild. She vows to continue fighting for justice on behalf of Khalil and all other black people killed at the hands of police."
Actual,"Arnold Spirit Jr. (“Junior”) tells about his early life on the Spokane reservation. How doctors predicted he would die from complications of hydrocephalus—his being born with excess spinal fluid on the brain. But, of course, Junior survived. The early condition, however, left Junior with a lisp and stutter. He had too many teeth and had to have some removed, and he is far-sighted in one eye and near-sighted in the other. Worst of all, as a small child he had seizures. Even today, other Native Americans on the reservation or, as Junior calls it, the “rez,” bully him and call him names like “hydrohead.” Junior’s best friend, Rowdy, often promises to protect him, but Rowdy’s own violent tendencies sometimes prevent him from being all that helpful. Junior’s parents are alcoholics and his sister, Mary, spends all her time in the family basement. Junior loves drawing cartoons, and many of his drawings are included in the book. Rowdy is extremely supportive of Junior’s art, and Junior thinks this proves his and Rowdy’s friendship.
In the summer before their freshman year of high school, Rowdy convinces Junior to go with him to the Spokane powwow. Junior is fourteen. Rowdy promises to protect Junior from any bullies, but, soon after they arrive, Rowdy trips into a van, embarrassing himself. Rowdy takes out his anger by attacking the van with a shovel, but the vandalism scares Junior. Junior runs away into a set of mean, drunk, thirty-year-old triplets. They push him around and beat him up. Later, to make up for having let Junior down, Rowdy sneaks into the triplets’ camp at night and cuts off their long braids, emasculating them. Junior sees it as more proof that Rowdy does the best he can. Soon thereafter, Junior and Rowdy begin their first year at Wellpinit High. Junior is excited to get started and is especially looking forward to his geometry class. But his geometry teacher, Mr. P, gives Junior a textbook that Junior sees was signed by his mother, Agnes Adams, thirty years previously. He throws the textbook in a fit of rage. It hits Mr. P in the face, breaking his nose.
After the textbook incident, Junior is suspended from school. Much to Junior’s surprise, Mr. P comes to Junior’s house to apologize to Junior. Mr. P tells Junior that there is no hope on the reservation, and that the best thing Junior can do for himself is to get off the reservation as quickly as possible. Mr. P says that Junior is smart, but that Mary was even smarter and more talented than Junior until the reservation crushed her spirit. Junior takes Mr. P advice, and, when his parents come home, he tells them he’s decided to go to school in the all-white town of Reardan, some twenty-two miles from home. Junior’s parents agree, and he starts school the next day. Because his family is very poor, sometimes without any money for gas, Junior often has difficulty getting to Reardan. He hitchhikes or gets rides from people like his dad’s friend, Eugene. On his first day, Junior meets his future girlfriend, Penelope. A few days later, the toughest jock, Roger, insults Junior with a racist joke, and Junior punches him in the face. Junior is surprised to find that his action earns him Roger’s respect. Then, Junior’s future friend, Gordy, sticks up for Junior in class.
On the reservation, however, Rowdy and the other Native Americans feel betrayed. Most react by ignoring Junior, but some are angrier than that. To impress Penelope, Junior decides to raise money for the homeless while trick-or-treating. But, after Junior starts going door-to-door, word gets around that he is carrying money. Junior gets jumped by three boys in masks. Junior fears that Rowdy is one of them. Penelope finds out and donates money in both her and Junior’s names. Then, around Thanksgiving, Mary gets married to a Montana poker player she meets at the Spokane casino, and she moves with him to Montana without saying goodbye to her family. Junior wonders if Mary is competing with him because he managed to get off the reservation. Junior hears from Mary occasionally thereafter by email and letter. In her messages, Mary says she is struggling to find a job, but she remains optimistic.
Later that fall, Junior tries out for the Reardan basketball team and has to play one-on-one against Roger, who is 6’6” and can dunk. It’s a tough match up, but Junior holds his own and is rewarded with a spot on the varsity team. Junior’s team plays an early game against Wellpinit on the reservation where the entire crowd turns its back on Junior when his team enters the gym. While Junior is checking into the game for the first time, a fan throws a quarter at him, hitting him in the head. Junior asks Eugene, an EMT, to stich him up in the locker room, but, just after he checks back into the game, Rowdy fouls Junior so badly he gives Junior a concussion. Reardan loses badly, but, weeks later, in the teams’ next match up at Reardan, Junior’s strong defense leads Reardan to decisive victory. Wellpinit’s season is ruined, and Reardan loses, later, early in the state playoffs.
Then the tragedies begin. Junior’s grandmother, whom Junior admires for her tolerance and generosity, is struck and killed by a drunk driver as she is walking home from a powwow. A white billionaire named Ted makes a pompous speech at her well-attended funeral, and the Native Americans laugh him off the reservation. Then, Eugene’s friend, Bobby, shoots Eugene in the face over the last sip of a bottle of wine. Later, just when Junior thinks things can’t get any worse, the school guidance counselor calls him into the hall to tell him that Mary has died. Junior’s dad picks him up from school and tells him that Mary and her husband’s trailer caught on fire while the two were passed out from excess drinking. Rowdy blames Junior for Mary’s death, but Junior somehow manages to finish the school year and get a decent report card. He and his family begin to heal, and he promises his Mom that he will never drink. That summer, Rowdy comes to Junior’s house to see if Junior will hang out. The book ends with the two playing a game of one-on-one in the summer heat."
Philosophy,"Sophie Amundsen is fourteen years old when the book begins, living in Norway. She begins a strange correspondence course in philosophy. Every day, a letter comes to her mailbox that contains a few questions and then later in the day a package comes with some typed pages describing the ideas of a philosopher who dealt with the issues raised by the questions. Although at first she does not know, later on Sophie learns that Alberto Knox is the name of the philosopher who is teaching her. He sends her packages via his dog Hermes. Alberto first tells Sophie that philosophy is extremely relevant to life and that if we do not question and ponder our very existence we are not really living. Then he proceeds to go through the history of western philosophy. Alberto teaches Sophie about the ancient myths that people had in the days before they tried to come up with natural explanations for the processes in the world. Then she learns about the natural philosophers who were concerned with change. Next Alberto describes Democritus and the theory of indivisible atoms underlying all of nature as well as the concept of fate.
At the same time as she takes the philosophy course, Sophie receives a strange postcard sent to Hilde Møller Knag, care of Sophie. The postcard is from Hilde's father and wishes Hilde happy birthday. Sophie is confused, and moreso when she finds a scarf with Hilde's name on it. She does not know what is happening but she is sure that Hilde and the philosophy course must somehow be connected. She learns about Socrates, who was wise enough to know that he knew nothing. Then Alberto sends her a video that shows him in present day Athens and somehow he seems to go back in time to ancient Athens. She learns about Plato and his world of ideas and then about Aristotle, who critiqued Plato, classified much of the natural world, and founded logic and our theory of concepts.
Then, as Sophie's education continues, the Hilde situation begins to get more complicated. She finds many more postcards to Hilde, and some of them are even dated on June 15, the day of Sophie will turn 15. The problem is that June 15 is still over a month away. She discovers some of this with her best friend Joanna, and one of the postcards tells Hilde that one day she will meet Sophie and also mentions Joanna. Strange things are happening that the girls cannot figure out. Sophie's relationship with her mother becomes somewhat strained as she tries both to cover up the correspondence with Alberto and to practice her philosophical thinking on her mom. Meanwhile, Alberto teaches Sophie about Jesus and the meeting of Indo-European and Semitic culture. She learns about St. Augustine, St. Aquinas, and the christianization of Greek philosophy that occurred in the Middle Ages. By this time, Sophie has met Alberto and he begins hinting that the philosophy is about to get extremely relevant to the strange things that are happening to her.
Sophie learns about the focus on humanity in the Renaissance and the extremes of the Baroque and then Alberto focuses on some key philosophers. Urgently, he teaches her about Descartes, who doubted, and by doing so knew at least that he could doubt. They move on to Spinoza as it becomes clear that Hilde's father has some awesome power over them. Then Sophie learns about the empiricists. Locke believed in natural rights and that everything we know is gained from experience. Hume, an important influence on Kant, showed that our actions are guided by feelings and warned against making laws based upon our experiences. But Berkeley is most important to Sophie because he suggested that perhaps our entire lives were inside the mind of God. And Alberto says that their lives are inside the mind of Albert Knag, Hilde's father.
At this point the story switches to Hilde's point of view. On June 15, the day she turns fifteen, Hilde receives a birthday gift from her father entitled Sophie's World. She begins to read and is enthralled. We follow the rest of Sophie's story from Hilde's perspective. Hilde becomes certain that Sophie exists, that she is not just a character in a book. Alberto has a plan to escape Albert Knag's mind, and they must finish the philosophy course before that can happen. He teaches Sophie about the Enlightenment and its humane values and about Kant and his unification of empiricist and rationalist thought. Things in Sophie's life have become completely insane but she and Alberto know they must figure out a way to do something. It will have to occur on the night of June 15, when Hilde's father returns home. They learn about the world spirit of Romanticism, Hegel's dialectical view of history, and Kierkegaard's belief that the individual's existence is primary. Meanwhile, Hilde plans a surprise for her father on his return home. They rush through Marx, Darwin, Freud, and Sartre, desperate to come up with a plan to escape even though everything they do is known by Hilde's father. Then at the end of Sophie's World, the book that Hilde is reading, while at a party for Sophie on June 15, Alberto and Sophie disappear. Hilde's father comes home and they talk about the book, and Hilde is sure that Sophie exists somewhere. Meanwhile, Sophie and Alberto have a new existence as spirit—they have escaped from Albert Knag's mind but they are invisible to other people and can walk right through them. Sophie wants to try to interfere in the world of Hilde and her father, and at the end of the book she is learning how to do so."
Dakotas,"Herbert Clutter inspects his ranch on the morning of November 14, 1959. That same morning, on the other side of Kansas, Perry Smith meets up with Dick Hickock. While the Clutters go about their daily business, running errands and baking cherry pies, Hickock and Smith are tuning their car. After a long drive, they pull up to the Clutter home with a shotgun and knife in hand.
That morning, the bodies are discovered by Susan Kidwell and another of Nancy's friends. Initially, the police are baffled. Bobby Rupp is a suspect until he passes a lie detector test. Alvin Dewey, the KBI agent in charge of the investigation, thinks that the killer must be someone close to the family. Rumor sets the small town of Holcomb on fire.

Lesson,"Grant Wiggins has been teaching on a plantation outside Bayonne, Louisiana, for several years when a slow-witted man named Jefferson is convicted of murder and sentenced to death. Jefferson claims he is innocent of the crime. He says he was on his way to a bar, but changed his mind and decided to tag along with two men who were on their way to a liquor store. Upon arriving there, the two men began arguing with the storeowner, and a shootout ensued. The storeowner and the two men died, and Jefferson remained at the scene of the crime. He was arrested and tried for murder. Jefferson’s lawyer argues in court that Jefferson is nothing but a poor fool, hardly more worthwhile than a hog, and therefore incapable of plotting such a scheme. The jury quickly brings back a guilty verdict.
	Upon hearing the lawyer’s speech, Jefferson’s godmother, Miss Emma, resolves to help Jefferson die like a man, not a hog. She asks Grant to help her, knowing that he will resist. Grant left many years prior to attend college, and he returned an educated man. He deplores the injustices done to his fellow black men, but he does not want to get involved in Jefferson’s case. However, after considerable pressure from his aunt, Tante Lou, he agrees to try to help Jefferson. Grant, Miss Emma, and Grant’s aunt go to visit Jefferson in his cell, and they discover that he too heard the lawyer’s words and has taken them to heart. Silent and moody, Jefferson resists Grant’s feeble attempts to reach him. The three visitors spend an uncomfortable hour in the cell and then leave.
	During the next few visits, Jefferson continues to frustrate Grant’s attempts to communicate. When Grant attempts to teach Jefferson about dignity, Jefferson insists that dignity is for “youmans,” not hogs. He eats and snuffles in imitation of a hog and tries to anger Grant with stubbornness and malice, but Grant maintains his patience. Each hour-long visit ends in failure, but Grant continues to try to reach Jefferson. On his fourth visit, Grant sparks a conversation with Jefferson about his final meal. Jefferson admits that he wants a gallon of vanilla ice cream because, although he loves ice cream, he has never had more than a thimbleful at a time. This admission begins to break down the barrier between the two men. Grant borrows money from some townspeople and buys Jefferson a small radio. On his next visit, he brings Jefferson a notebook and asks him to write down whatever thoughts come to his mind. Jefferson promises to do so, and by Grant’s next visit, Jefferson has filled most of a page with thoughts concerning the difference between hogs and men.
	Grant’s relationships with his girlfriend Vivian and with Reverend Ambrose begin to intensify. Despite her love for Grant, Vivian dislikes his tendency to think only of himself, showing little regard for her needs. Grant uses Vivian to escape the troubles of his life, and he continually suggests that they run away from their hometown and their past in the South. The Reverend Ambrose, himself unable to reach Jefferson, urges Grant to put aside his atheistic beliefs and help save not just Jefferson’s character, but his soul. The Reverend declares that Grant must learn to tell lies for the good of others.
	Grant focuses his energy on Jefferson and tries to explain the importance of Jefferson’s death. Jefferson asks Grant if he believes in heaven and Grant replies that he does not, although he qualifies this remark by saying that his atheism does not make him a good man. In fact, Grant says, Jefferson will save even Grant’s atheistic soul if he carries the cross for the sinners on earth. Grant explains that the black community in the quarter has spent centuries enslaved to white men, and that when Jefferson’s attorney called him a hog, he attacked the will and intelligence of the entire black society. In consequence, Jefferson now has the opportunity to stand up for his community. He has become a symbol to his people, and the manner in which he faces his death will bear on their self--confidence and potential.
	Over the next few weeks, Jefferson continues to write in his journal. In March, the governor of Louisiana sets the execution date for two weeks after Easter. As news of Jefferson’s impending death spreads through the town, more and more people begin to visit him. Young children and old men, strangers and friends, all come to -Jefferson’s cell to speak to him. The onslaught of attention makes Jefferson begin to understand the enormity of the task that Grant has given him. He realizes that he has become much more than an ordinary man and that his death will represent much more than an ordinary death. Elated by Jefferson’s progress, Grant nevertheless dreads the execution day, when that progress will be tested.
	Grant cannot bring himself to attend the execution, for he has grown very close to Jefferson. At the time the execution is scheduled to take place, he orders his students to kneel by their desks in honor of Jefferson. He steps outside the classroom, distressed and bewildered. He knows he should have attended the execution. A few minutes later, a deputy comes down from the courthouse and informs Grant that the execution is over. He assures Grant that Jefferson was the bravest man in the room that morning. Grant looks out over the town, numb and heavyhearted, and discovers that he is crying."
Counter,"At the age of nineteen, Edmond Dantès seems to have the perfect life. He is about to become the captain of a ship, he is engaged to a beautiful and kind young woman, Mercédès, and he is well liked by almost everyone who knows him. This perfect life, however, stirs up dangerous jealousy among some of Dantès’s so-called friends. Danglars, the treasurer of Dantès’s ship, envies Dantès’s early career success; Fernand Mondego is in love with Dantès’s fiancée and so covets his amorous success; his neighbor Caderousse is simply envious that Dantès is so much luckier in life than he is.
Together, these three men draft a letter accusing Dantès of treason. There is some truth to their accusations: as a favor to his recently deceased captain, Dantès is carrying a letter from Napoleon to a group of Bonapartist sympathizers in Paris. Though Dantès himself has no political leanings, the undertaking is enough to implicate him for treason. On the day of his wedding, Dantès is arrested for his alleged crimes.
The deputy public prosecutor, Villefort, sees through the plot to frame Dantès and is prepared to set him free. At the last moment, though, Dantès jeopardizes his freedom by revealing the name of the man to whom he is supposed to deliver Napoleon’s letter. The man, Noirtier, is Villefort’s father. Terrified that any public knowledge of his father’s treasonous activities will thwart his own ambitions, Villefort decides to send Dantès to prison for life. Despite the entreaties of Monsieur Morrel, Dantès’s kind and honest boss, Dantès is sent to the infamous Château d’If, where the most dangerous political prisoners are kept.
While in prison, Dantès meets Abbé Faria, an Italian priest and intellectual, who has been jailed for his political views. Faria teaches Dantès history, science, philosophy, and languages, turning him into a well-educated man. Faria also bequeaths to Dantès a large treasure hidden on the island of Monte Cristo, and he tells him how to find it should he ever escape. When Faria dies, Dantès hides himself in the abbé’s shroud, thinking that he will be buried and then dig his way out. Instead, Dantès is thrown into the sea, and is able to cut himself loose and swim to freedom.
Dantès travels to Monte Cristo and finds Faria’s enormous treasure. He considers his fortune a gift from God, given to him for the sole purpose of rewarding those who have tried to help him and, more important, punishing those who have hurt him. Disguising himself as an Italian priest who answers to the name of Abbé Busoni, he travels back to Marseilles and visits Caderousse, who is now struggling to make a living as an innkeeper. From Caderousse he learns the details of the plot to frame him. In addition, Dantès learns that his father has died of grief in his absence and that Mercédès has married Fernand Mondego. Most frustrating, he learns that both Danglars and Mondego have become rich and powerful and are living happily in Paris. As a reward for this information, and for Caderousse’s apparent regret over the part he played in Dantès’s downfall, Dantès gives Caderousse a valuable diamond. Before leaving Marseilles, Dantès anonymously saves Morrel from financial ruin.
Ten years later, Dantès emerges in Rome, calling himself the Count of Monte Cristo. He seems to be all knowing and unstoppable. In Rome Dantès ingratiates himself to Albert de Morcerf, son of Fernand Mondego and Mercédès, by saving him from bandits. In return for the favor, Albert introduces Dantès to Parisian society. None of his old cohorts recognize the mysterious count as Edmond Dantès, though Mercédès does. Dantès is thus able to insinuate himself effortlessly into the lives of Danglars, Mondego, and Villefort. Armed with damning knowledge about each of them that he has gathered over the past decade, Dantès sets an elaborate scheme of revenge into motion.
Mondego, now known as the Count de Morcerf, is the first to be punished. Dantès exposes Morcerf’s darkest secret: Morcerf made his fortune by betraying his former patron, the Greek vizier Ali Pacha, and he then sold Ali Pacha’s wife and daughter into slavery. Ali Pacha’s daughter, Haydée, who has lived with Dantès ever since he bought her freedom seven years earlier, testifies against Morcerf in front of the senate, irreversibly ruining his good name. Ashamed by Morcerf’s treachery, Albert and Mercédès flee, leaving their tainted fortune behind. Morcerf commits suicide.
Villefort’s punishment comes slowly and in several stages. Dantès first takes advantage of Madame de Villefort’s murderous intent, subtly tutoring her in the uses of poison. As Madame de Villefort wreaks her havoc, killing off each member of the household in turn, Dantès plants the seeds for yet another public exposé. In court, it is revealed that Villefort is guilty of attempted infanticide, as he tried to bury his illegitimate baby while it was still alive. Believing that everyone he loves is dead and knowing that he will soon have to answer severe criminal charges, Villefort goes insane.
For his revenge on Danglars, Dantès simply plays upon his enemy’s greed. He opens various false credit accounts with Danglars that cost him vast amounts of money. He also manipulates Danglars’s unfaithful and dishonest wife, costing Danglars more money, and helps Danglars’s daughter, Eugénie, run away with her female companion. Finally, when Danglars is nearly broke and about to flee without paying any of his creditors, Dantès has the Italian bandit Luigi Vampa kidnap him and relieve him of his remaining money. Dantès spares Danglars’s life, but leaves him penniless.
Meanwhile, as these acts of vengeance play out, Dantès also tries to complete one more act of goodness. Dantès wishes to help the brave and honorable Maximilian Morrel, the son of the kind shipowner, so he hatches an elaborate plot to save Maximilian’s fiancée, Valentine Villefort, from her murderous stepmother, to ensure that the couple will be truly happy forever. Dantès gives Valentine a pill that makes her appear dead and then carries her off to the island of Monte Cristo. For a month Dantès allows Maximilian to believe that Valentine is dead, which causes Maximilian to long for death himself. Dantès then reveals that Valentine is alive. Having known the depths of despair, Maximilian is now able to experience the heights of ecstasy. Dantès too ultimately finds happiness, when he allows himself to fall in love with the adoring and beautiful Haydée."
Assurance,"A Raisin in the Sun portrays a few weeks in the life of the Youngers, a Black family living on the South Side of Chicago in the 1950s. When the play opens, the Youngers are about to receive an insurance check for $10,000. This money comes from the deceased Mr. Younger’s life insurance policy. Each of the adult members of the family has an idea as to what he or she would like to do with this money. The matriarch of the family, Mama, wants to buy a house to fulfill a dream she shared with her husband. Mama’s son, Walter Lee, would rather use the money to invest in a liquor store with his friends. He believes that the investment will solve the family’s financial problems forever. Walter’s wife, Ruth, agrees with Mama, however, and hopes that she and Walter can provide more space and opportunity for their son, Travis. Finally, Beneatha, Walter’s sister and Mama’s daughter, wants to use the money for her medical school tuition. She also wishes that her family members were not so interested in assimilating into the white world. Beneatha instead tries to find her identity by looking back to the past and to Africa.
As the play progresses, the Youngers clash over their competing dreams. Ruth discovers that she is pregnant but fears that if she has the child, she will put more financial pressure on her family members. When Walter says nothing to Ruth’s admission that she is considering abortion, Mama puts a down payment on a house for the whole family. She believes that a bigger, brighter dwelling will help them all. This house is in Clybourne Park, an entirely white neighborhood. When the Youngers’ future neighbors find out that the Youngers are moving in, they send Mr. Lindner, from the Clybourne Park Improvement Association, to offer the Youngers money in return for staying away. The Youngers refuse the deal, even after Walter loses the rest of the money ($6,500) to his friend Willy Harris, who persuades Walter to invest in the liquor store and then runs off with his cash.
In the meantime, Beneatha rejects her suitor, George Murchison, whom she believes to be shallow and blind to the problems of race. Subsequently, she receives a marriage proposal from her Nigerian boyfriend, Joseph Asagai, who wants Beneatha to get a medical degree and move to Africa with him (Beneatha does not make her choice before the end of the play). The Youngers eventually move out of the apartment, fulfilling the family’s long-held dream. Their future seems uncertain and slightly dangerous, but they are optimistic and determined to live a better life. They believe that they can succeed if they stick together as a family and resolve to defer their dreams no longer."
Revisions,"Esi, a government official who works for the Department of Urban Statistics, drives her old car over to the offices of Linga HideAway Travel in order to make some business travel arrangements. There, she meets the head of the company, Ali Kondey, a charming and handsome man who is later described as the best advertisement for the company because of his multiple national identities. The two are immediately attracted to each another. Ali offers to drive Esi home after promising to take care of all of the necessary travel arrangements, but Esi declines because she has her own car.
One morning, Ogyaanowa, the daughter of Esi and Oko, listens to the sounds of her parents fighting while she eats her breakfast. In the bedroom, Oko and Esi instigate yet another fight about their marriage. Oko is angry that Esi refuses to have another child and that she spends so much time at work. Oko says that his friends are beginning to laugh at him. Angry, he grabs Esi and forces her to have sex with him. Rather than apologize for his actions, he grabs the bed sheet and walks out of the bedroom. At work, Esi contemplates the fact that what just happened to her could be described as marital rape, even though no such term exists. She decides that she is going to leave her husband.
Opokuya, Esi’s best friend, begins a conversation with her husband, Kubi, about which of them needs the car. Opokuya, in addition to being a nurse, is also a mother. Although Kubi’s needs are frequently less pressing than Opakuya’s, he almost always “wins” their argument and gets use of the car. Esi runs into Opokuya in a hotel lobby. The two women have a drink and discuss Esi’s recent decision to divorce her husband. As they talk, Ali coincidentally enters the hotel as well. Esi tells Opokuya about the gifts that Ali has been sending her, and Opokuya tells Esi about her children and marriage. Esi hopes that Opokuya can understand her decision to leave Oko.
Ali is already married to his childhood friend and love, Fusena. The two have known each other since they were young, and after developing a friendship, they finally married. Following their marriage, Ali moved to London to complete his education. Fusena gave up her career and education in order to become a mother at Ali’s insistence. In spite of his marriage to Fusena, Ali and Esi’s relationship grows, and they soon become lovers. Ali disappears for two weeks, in part because of complications with his marriage and work. Shortly after he sees Esi again, he proposes to her. After discussing the potential complications with family and Ali’s wife, Ali offers Esi a wedding band. Following the proposal, Ali begins to spend more and more time at Esi’s house, showering her and her family with gifts. Esi discusses with Opokuya her upcoming marriage and her thoughts on polygamy.
Ali takes one of his coworkers to visit Esi’s family to discuss the marriage according to proper tradition. He is rejected because he fails to bring along a respectable member of his family. When Ali finally approaches his family and asks them to speak on his behalf, they are at first reluctant, but eventually consent. Esi’s mother and grandmother are disappointed in her decision to get divorced and become a second wife, but in the end they accept her decision. Ali returns to Esi’s family with his elders, and the marriage is approved. It is a simple ceremony, and afterward, Esi returns home alone.
On New Year’s Eve, Ali rushes over to Esi’s house before returning to his family. Shortly after, Oko appears with their daughter, and the two men begin to fight. Esi grabs Ogyaanowa and runs out of the house to Opokuya’s place. She tells Opokuya and Kubi everything that happened. Kubi goes to Esi’s house and finds that both men have left. He checks on Oko at Oko’s mother’s house and finds that he is only slightly injured.
Six months later, Ali takes Esi to Bamako, his home village, for a vacation. They have a wonderful time. Ali’s family, after initially rejecting Esi, now accepts her. Their relationship begins to change, though after they return, Ali starts spending less time with Esi. Rather than spending time with her after work, he drives his new secretary, who is young and attractive, home. By the end of the year, Esi feels completely abandoned. She is alienated from her own daughter and spends Christmas alone. She takes sleeping pills to help her get through the day. Finally, on New Year’s Day, Ali appears at Esi’s house, driving a brand new car. The car is a present and a bribe for Esi. Immediately after giving her the car, Ali drives off. Esi drives the new car to Opokuya’s house. Opokuya is so jealous and taken aback by the new car that Esi cannot begin to tell her how she really feels about the present. Esi offers Opokuya her old car.
At the start of another new year, Ali spends more time with Esi but quickly falls back into his old habits. He sends her gifts from all over the world in order to compensate for his absence. Three years into their marriage, Esi finally tells Ali that she cannot be in such a relationship with him. Three months later, Opokuya finally goes to Esi’s house to take away her old car. She is too excited about owning a car to share in Esi’s sadness. After Opokuya leaves, Kubi arrives and searches for his wife. Upon seeing that Esi is distraught, he hugs her and then begins to kiss her. Before Kubi can take off his clothes, Esi backs away from him, and he leaves. Esi and Ali remain close friends and occasional lovers, and they never get a divorce even though Ali continues to have affairs with other women."
Death,"Death introduces himself as the narrator of the novel. The first time he saw the book thief, he says, was on a train. The next time he saw her was when he came for a pilot who had crashed his plane. And the third time was after a bombing. He associates a color with each sighting: white, red, and black, the colors of the Nazi flag. Death then begins the story. Liesel, her mother, and her brother Werner are traveling on a train to Munich when Werner suddenly dies. Liesel and her mother get off the train to bury the body, and Liesel steals a book from one of the gravediggers. She and her mother continue their journey to a town called Molching, where Liesel will be raised by foster parents, Hans and Rosa Hubermann. At first Liesel doesn’t like her foster parents, but Hans wins her over by teaching her to roll cigarettes for him.
Slowly, Liesel adjusts to her new life, though she is plagued by nightmares of her dead brother. She meets and befriends a neighborhood boy named Rudy, who worships the American athlete Jesse Owens and constantly pesters Liesel to kiss him. When Hans discovers that Liesel doesn’t know how to read, he begins teaching her the alphabet, and together they make their way through the book Liesel stole from the gravedigger. Meanwhile, the political situation in Molching and throughout Germany is becoming serious, with war escalating and food and work shortages at home. When the town holds a book-burning to celebrate Hitler’s birthday, Liesel steals another book from the flames.
Liesel begins delivering laundry for Rosa. One of Rosa’s customers is the mayor’s wife, Ilsa Hermann. One day Liesel is invited into Ilsa Hermann’s study, where she marvels at the walls of books. Frau Hermann allows her to read in the study. Meanwhile, in Stuttgart, a German Jew named Max hides in a closet with no food, light, or water. A friend brings him false identity papers and a map hidden in MKPF, Hitler’s autobiography. Max leaves the closet and takes the train to the Hubermanns’ house. Hans, we learn, served with Max’s father in World War I. After Max’s father died, Hans promised Max’s mother he would always help her. When Max arrives in Molching, Hans and Rosa hide him in the basement. As he recovers from his ordeal, he and Liesel become friends, and Max writes her a book on the painted-over pages of MKPF.
Frau Hermann tells Liesel she can’t afford to send out the laundry anymore. Liesel is furious because her family is already struggling to survive and the Hermanns have so much. With Rudy’s help, Liesel begins sneaking into the Hermanns’ library and stealing books. For Christmas, Liesel builds Max a snowman in the basement. When Max gets sick and falls into a coma, Hans and Rosa worry about how they will dispose of the corpse if he dies. After months, Max recovers. Nazi soldiers arrive and inspect the basement to see if it is deep enough for a bomb shelter. Luckily, they don’t see Max. Liesel continues stealing books from the Hermanns’ library. Frau Hermann leaves her a dictionary and thesaurus with a note saying she knows Liesel has been stealing from her. At a Hitler Youth carnival, Rudy wins three races. The Allies begin bombing near Molching, and the people on Liesel’s block must take shelter in a neighbor’s basement. With each raid, Liesel reads to them until it’s safe to exit. Max, meanwhile, has to stay in the Hubermanns’ basement by himself.
As the war intensifies, Nazi soldiers begin parading Jewish prisoners through town on their way to the concentration camp at Dachau. When Hans sees an old man struggling to keep up with the group, he gives him a piece of bread. Nazi soldiers intervene and whip both the man and Hans. Hans realizes he has aroused suspicion and drawn attention to himself, and Max is no longer safe in the basement. That night, Max leaves Hans and Rosa’s house. Hans waits for soldiers to come take him away, but none do. Instead, they come to Rudy’s house, to recruit him for a school for future Nazi leaders. Rudy’s father, Alex, refuses to let his son go. The soldiers leave, but a few days later both Alex and Hans are drafted into the German army. After Alex and Hans leave for duty, Rudy and Liesel go to the next parade of Jews and scatter bread in the streets. Rosa gives Liesel a book that Max made for her called “The Word Shaker.” It is the story of Max and Liesel’s friendship, and promises they will be reunited some day.
Hans is sent to Essen, where he is part of a squad that cleans up after air raids. Another member of the squad takes a dislike to Hans, and one day he insists they change places on their work bus. The bus crashes and the other man is killed, while Hans merely breaks his leg. Hans gets sent home to recuperate. Following another air raid, Liesel and Rudy find an Allied fighter pilot who has crashed his plane. They arrive just in time to see him die. Death sees Liesel for the second time when he comes to collect the pilot’s soul. The Nazis continue to parade the Jews through Molching, and Liesel sees Max among the prisoners. Liesel tells Rudy about hiding Max. She had never told anyone before.
The mayor’s wife gives Liesel a blank notebook so she can begin writing her own story. One night, while Liesel is in the basement editing her book, her neighborhood is bombed. Hans, Rosa, Rudy, and the rest of the neighbors are killed. When rescue workers pull Liesel out of the rubble, she finds Rudy’s corpse and gives him the kiss he always wanted. When the workers take her away, she leaves behind her finished book, called “The Book Thief.” Death, who has been watching, rescues the book. Liesel goes to live with the mayor and his wife. After the liberation of the concentration camps, Max returns to Molching and finds Liesel. They hug and cry together. Liesel eventually grows up and moves to Australia, where she has a family and lives to an old age. When Death finally comes to take her soul, he shows her the book she wrote so many years before."
It,"The novel begins where It Ends with Us left off, after the novel’s protagonists Lily Kincaid and Atlas Corrigan run into each other on the street, and Lily tells Atlas she and Ryle are now divorced. Told in chapters that alternate between Atlas’s and Lily’s perspectives, the novel begins with Atlas nervously hoping Lily will text him soon like she said she would. This hope keeps him uplifted as he handles the reality that someone broke into his restaurant, Bib’s, and vandalized it with a misspelled profanity. Meanwhile, Lily is incredibly busy at Lily Bloom’s, her flower shop, and is confused about what to do about Atlas, knowing a romance with Atlas will infuriate her jealous and abusive ex-husband, Ryle, with whom she shares jointed custody of their infant daughter Emerson.   
Atlas visits the flower shop wanting to talk to Lily and ask her if they can speak on the phone that evening. Ryle comes in unexpectedly, and a panicked Lily hides Atlas in the office supply closet. Lily and Atlas do talk on FaceTime that evening, catching up on each other’s lives, flirting, and testing the waters of their relationship. Hearing that Ryle responded in rage after reading Lily’s teenage journals about Atlas, Atlas asks Lily to read to him from the journals. 
On their first date, Lily gifts Atlas one of her journals. Exhausted after staying up all night with a sick Emerson, Lily falls asleep during the ride to the restaurant. Atlas lets Lily sleep, content to read her journal, reliving their first kiss. Inspired, Atlas writes Lily a letter about his life before her. Atlas recounts how his mother rejected and abused him as a teenager, choosing herself and her abusive husband Tim over Atlas. He says that Lily changed his life and taught him what love was. When Lily wakes up, she reads Atlas’s letter and is moved by it. They want to kiss goodnight but decide to continue taking it slow. 
After his date with Lily, Atlas encounters his mother, Sutton, who is at his restaurant to ask Atlas if he knows where his twelve-year-old brother Josh is. Atlas tells Sutton he didn’t know Josh existed until their conversation. Atlas realizes that Josh is likely the vandal targeting his restaurants. As Atlas deals with Sutton, Lily returns from their date to an angry Ryle, who has just watched Finding Nemo for the first time. Ryle is furious that his daughter’s middle name, Dory, is associated with Atlas, as he is aware that Lily and Atlas often talked about Dory as teenagers. Ryle’s rage-fueled confrontation shakes Lily, and after getting away from Atlas, she is comforted when Marshall, Ryle’s best friend and brother-in-law, tells her she was right to leave Ryle. After their respective rough nights, Atlas drives to Lily’s house to give her a hug. Afterward, Atlas stakes out Bib’s and reads Lily’s journal entry about the first time he and Lily made love, after which Lily’s father almost beat him to death. Atlas catches Josh attempting to vandalize his restaurant. He convinces Josh to come stay with him. Atlas doesn’t want Josh to return to live with Sutton, who he feels is still abusive and only cares about herself. The following day, Sutton demands that Atlas bring Josh to her, and when he does, Atlas sees Sutton strike Josh. He immediately gets Josh back in the car and then takes him to the hospital, vowing to fight for custody.  
Lily invites Atlas to be her date for her coworker Lucy’s wedding. While Lily is getting ready, Atlas sees Lily’s collarbone, the spot where Ryle once bit Lily, and notices the heart tattoo that Lily got as a teenager. Atlas feels upset upon realizing Ryle bit Lily’s collarbone out of jealousy. Lily realizes Atlas’s anger is protective, and she isn’t afraid of him. Atlas and Lily kiss. After making a brief appearance at Lucy’s wedding, they return to Lily’s and make love for the first time since they were teenagers. Afterward, they talk about Atlas fighting for custody of Josh and about the aftermath of Lily’s father’s violent outburst the last time they made love. Atlas returns home to Josh.  
The next morning, Lily is woken to the sound of Ryle pounding her door. Ryle notices evidence of the previous evening and quickly figures out that Lily was with Atlas. He flies into a rage, pinning her to the wall by her throat. Lily, afraid that he’s going to come for Emerson, tells her mother, who watched Emerson the previous night, to take her to a park. Unsure where to go after she picks Emerson up, Lily takes Emerson to Atlas’s and hides out. Josh is working on a homework assignment about his family tree that he struggles to finish because he doesn’t know his family. Atlas thinks if he and Lily were together, he’d raise Emerson as his own daughter. 
Lily wakes up the next morning to a series of angry, threatening texts from Ryle, who also comes to the flower shop to try to make nice after his drunken, menacing texts. Lily tells Ryle she’s sent the messages to her lawyer. Ryle leaves in a rage, and Lily warns Atlas that Ryle may be coming for him, and before Atlas hangs up, Ryle is there. Ryle punches Atlas, blaming him for his problems with Lily. Atlas nonconfrontationally points out to Ryle that his marriage ended because of his temper. Atlas tries to convince Ryle that they need to be a team, since Emerson is impacted by all of their behavior. Ryle leaves, somewhat less angry. Atlas tells Lily about the conversation, and she is pleased that he diffused the situation with words and not violence. 
Atlas and Lily are having a peaceful morning together when Sutton arrives at Atlas’s, demanding Josh back. Josh returns from Theo’s and is afraid of his mother. He insists he wants to live with his father, Tim. Sutton leaves and Lily connects with Josh while Atlas calms down. Atlas takes Josh to see his father in Vermont. Josh realizes he wants to stay with Atlas and says his family tree can be a seedling with two branches—one for him and one for Atlas. Later, Allysa, Marshall, and Lily confront Ryle, telling him that he needs to go to anger management and that he’ll only have supervised visits with Emerson and Rylee until further notice. Ryle is upset but agrees to get help. Meanwhile, Atlas tells Sutton that he wants custody of Josh but encourages her to meet them once a week for dinner, so she can still have a relationship with both her sons. Six months after they began dating, Atlas and Lily move in together. A few years later, they get married. In his vows, Atlas says that no matter what happens, he’s grateful to have gotten to love Lily and even to have her break his heart. He is hopeful for the future."
Dominion,"Ten years have passed since the fall of Troy, and the Greek hero Odysseus still has not returned to his kingdom in Ithaca. A large and rowdy mob of suitors who have overrun Odysseus’s palace and pillaged his land continue to court his wife, Penelope. She has remained faithful to Odysseus. Prince Telemachus, Odysseus’s son, wants desperately to throw them out but does not have the confidence or experience to fight them. One of the suitors, Antinous, plans to assassinate the young prince, eliminating the only opposition to their dominion over the palace.
Read more about The Odyssey’s precursor, The Iliad.
Unknown to the suitors, Odysseus is still alive. The beautiful nymph Calypso, possessed by love for him, has imprisoned him on her island, Ogygia. He longs to return to his wife and son, but he has no ship or crew to help him escape. While the gods and goddesses of Mount Olympus debate Odysseus’s future, Athena, Odysseus’s strongest supporter among the gods, resolves to help Telemachus. Disguised as a friend of the prince’s grandfather, Laertes, she convinces the prince to call a meeting of the assembly at which he reproaches the suitors. Athena also prepares him for a great journey to Pylos and Sparta, where the kings Nestor and Menelaus, Odysseus’s companions during the war, inform him that Odysseus is alive and trapped on Calypso’s island. Telemachus makes plans to return home, while, back in Ithaca, Antinous and the other suitors prepare an ambush to kill him when he reaches port.
On Mount Olympus, Zeus sends Hermes to rescue Odysseus from Calypso. Hermes persuades Calypso to let Odysseus build a ship and leave. The homesick hero sets sail, but when Poseidon, god of the sea, finds him sailing home, he sends a storm to wreck Odysseus’s ship. Poseidon has harbored a bitter grudge against Odysseus since the hero blinded his son, the Cyclops Polyphemus, earlier in his travels. Athena intervenes to save Odysseus from Poseidon’s wrath, and the beleaguered king lands at Scheria, home of the Phaeacians. Nausicaa, the Phaeacian princess, shows him to the royal palace, and Odysseus receives a warm welcome from the king and queen. When he identifies himself as Odysseus, his hosts, who have heard of his exploits at Troy, are stunned. They promise to give him safe passage to Ithaca, but first they beg to hear the story of his adventures.
Odysseus spends the night describing the fantastic chain of events leading up to his arrival on Calypso’s island. He recounts his trip to the Land of the Lotus Eaters, his battle with Polyphemus the Cyclops, his love affair with the witch-goddess Circe, his temptation by the deadly Sirens, his journey into Hades to consult the prophet Tiresias, and his fight with the sea monster Scylla. When he finishes his story, the Phaeacians return Odysseus to Ithaca, where he seeks out the hut of his faithful swineherd, Eumaeus. Though Athena has disguised Odysseus as a beggar, Eumaeus warmly receives and nourishes him in the hut. He soon encounters Telemachus, who has returned from Pylos and Sparta despite the suitors’ ambush, and reveals to him his true identity. Odysseus and Telemachus devise a plan to massacre the suitors and regain control of Ithaca.
When Odysseus arrives at the palace the next day, still disguised as a beggar, he endures abuse and insults from the suitors. The only person who recognizes him is his old nurse, Eurycleia, but she swears not to disclose his secret. Penelope takes an interest in this strange beggar, suspecting that he might be her long-lost husband. Quite crafty herself, Penelope organizes an archery contest the following day and promises to marry any man who can string Odysseus’s great bow and fire an arrow through a row of twelve axes—a feat that only Odysseus has ever been able to accomplish. At the contest, each suitor tries to string the bow and fails. Odysseus steps up to the bow and, with little effort, fires an arrow through all twelve axes. He then turns the bow on the suitors. He and Telemachus, assisted by a few faithful servants, kill every last suitor.
Odysseus reveals himself to the entire palace and reunites with his loving Penelope. He travels to the outskirts of Ithaca to see his aging father, Laertes. They come under attack from the vengeful family members of the dead suitors, but Laertes, reinvigorated by his son’s return, successfully kills Antinous’s father and puts a stop to the attack. Zeus dispatches Athena to restore peace. With his power secure and his family reunited, Odysseus’s long ordeal comes to an end."
Relation,"Alex Claremont-Diaz is the 21-year-old son of Ellen Claremont, the first female president of the United States. Alex is highly ambitious, with his sights set on a career in politics like his mother and his father, who is a US senator. Alex is finishing his last year of college and living in the White House with his family, including his older sister June. As the novel opens, June and Alex discuss the British royal wedding, which they are about to attend, and Alex talks about how much he hates the groom’s younger brother, Prince Henry. When Alex was 12, he used to look repeatedly at a photo of Henry from one of June’s teen magazines. But when he met Henry in person, Henry was rude to him, and he’s disliked Henry ever since. At the wedding, Alex is focused on Prince Henry and is irritated by everything he does, especially when he asks June to dance for a photo opportunity. Drunk, Alex confronts Henry for acting superior, and the two end up in a physical altercation that topples the $75,000 royal wedding cake. The international incident is a scandal, and Alex is forced to pretend to be Henry’s close friend to squash rumors of a shaky relationship between the United States and Britain. 
Alex has no choice but to go along with the plan. As Alex and Henry spend more time together, however, Alex is continually surprised by Henry and finds that Henry is not at all what he expected. He’s especially moved when he sees Henry speaking warmly and openly to a young girl with cancer. Before Alex can talk to Henry about it, there’s a loud noise like gunshots, and the two are rushed into a supply closet by security. In the closet, Henry ends up apologizing for mistreating Alex in the past and says he was cold to Alex because his father had just died. Alex and Henry exchange phone numbers and start texting and talking on the phone. The Claremont-Diaz clan has a family dinner, and Ellen offers both Alex and June positions in her reelection campaign. Alex is thrilled, but June, who wants to be a journalist, declines the offer. 
Alex, June, and their best friend Nora, who is the granddaughter of the Vice President, throw their annual New Year’s Eve party. Henry attends with his best friend Pez, who is enamored of June. Everyone is having fun together, but when Henry sees Alex and Nora kiss at midnight, he gets jealous and leaves the party. Alex finds him in the garden, and Henry kisses him for the first time. This spurs a crisis of sexual identity in Alex, who can’t stop thinking about the kiss. Though Alex has had a sexual relationship with his high school friend Liam and been attracted to men, he’s never considered himself bisexual. He talks to Nora about his confusion, and she says that Henry is gay, and that Alex seems to have feelings for Henry. When Henry flies in for a dinner, Alex kisses him while a security guard keeps watch. That night, they have sex for the first time, and Alex says they are friends with benefits. Henry and Alex continue to meet up to have sex when they can get away. They also begin to write flirtatious emails to each other and have heart-to-hearts on the phone. After a night on the town with June, Nora, Henry, Pez, and Henry’s sister Bea, Alex begins to develop feelings for Henry. 
Since Alex's mother is running for reelection and because Henry is a royal, it’s crucial that Henry and Alex’s relationship remain a secret. Alex often turns to his mentor and family friend, Senator Rafael Luna, for advice to help his mother with her campaign. It’s a blow to the whole family when Luna comes out as the running mate for Ellen’s opponent, Jeffrey Richards. Alex is devastated, and Henry comes to visit Alex at the Democratic National Convention to comfort him. The next morning, Zahra, Ellen’s chief of staff and family friend, catches Henry and Alex together and agrees to keep it a secret until after the convention. Alex comes out to his mother, who creates a PowerPoint presentation as a means of talking about the dangers of his relationship with Henry. She tells him she’ll support him, but he needs to be sure the relationship is forever. He goes to his family’s lake house with Henry, June, Nora, and his father Oscar. Alex comes out to his father, too, and he realizes that he is in love with Henry. Just as he’s about to tell Henry how he feels, Henry suddenly becomes formal and fake and leaves the conversation. The next morning Henry leaves the lake house without saying goodbye, leaving only a note. 
When Henry stops responding to Alex’s texts, Alex is distraught. He flies to London to confront Henry. Henry says he can’t be in a relationship with Alex because of the royal family. They have sex, and neither of them is sure whether it is a goodbye or the beginning of their relationship. Henry gives Alex his signet ring and says he wants to be with Alex. They are happy to be together, and they send each other passionate emails when they are apart.
Suspicions about their relationship start coming out in the press, so Alex and Henry pretend to go on dates with Nora and June. It’s painful for Henry to pretend to be someone he isn’t. Then, Akex and Henry's relationship is leaked to the press, with photos of them together and their entire email history. They are both forced to go on a communication blackout, and Ellen’s team attempts to triage the situation. Alex is miserable and worried about Henry. Eventually, he flies to London. Alex and Bea help Henry confront his family, including his grandmother, the Queen. As the Queen argues that the world will never accept them, a group of people gathers outside the palace to express support for Alex and Henry’s love.  
Nora, who has been missing since the news of Alex and Henry’s relationship broke, emerges and reveals that it was the Richards campaign that leaked their photographs and emails. Alex figures out that it was Luna who tipped them off. Alex talks to Luna, and Luna reveals that Richards sexually assaulted him when he was his intern. Luna joined the campaign to expose Richards as a sexual predator. Election night is tense, and in the end, whoever wins Texas, Ellen’s home state, will win the election. Ellen wins, and Henry joins Alex onstage for her victory lap. The two leave the party and go to Alex’s house. Alex shows Henry where he grew up, letting them in with the key he always wears around his neck."
Tap,"Joe Bonham lies injured in a hospital bed. While conscious, Joe thinks back over scenes from his past: the night of his father's death and the night before he left his girlfriend Kareen to go to World War I. Before his family moved to Los Angeles, Joe grew up in Shale City, a small town in Colorado. He remembers small-town memories and images, such as the food his mother would prepare, the first time an airplane came to Shale City, and the night he lost his girlfriend, Diane, to his best friend, Bill Harper.
The narrative shifts from the past to the present as Joe thinks regretfully about his decision to join a war that was not any of his business. Slowly, Joe begins to realize that he has been severely injured and treated in a hospital, which is where he currently lies. Joe gradually feels that his arms and legs have been amputated. Furthermore, he realizes that he cannot speak, see, hear, or smell because he no longer has a face—only a mask covering where his face used to be. Joe wonders bitterly abut the doctors' motivation for saving him at all.
Joe continues to live inside his head, reliving memories and terrorized by nightmares. He wonders how he can even tell whether he is awake or asleep. Joe thinks about his father kept beautiful gardens in a vacant city lot and fed his children well, although he was never officially a success because he never made any money. Joe continues to think bitterly about the foolishness of fighting and dying in a war that had nothing to do with him, and about the deceitfulness of abstract words like ""liberty,"" ""democracy,"" ""freedom,"" and ""decency.""
Time passes, and Joe tries to occupy his mind with stories, facts, and figures. One day, he realizes that he should use the skin he has left—the skin of his neck that is not covered by blankets—to try to sense the outside world. Joe develops a plan to wait for the feeling of sunrise so that he can tally the nurses' visits and count the passing of the days. A year later, Joe has accomplished his goal and counted up 365 days. He celebrates the New Year in his mind, just as he has celebrated each Sunday of his year with an imagined walk in the woods.
In Joe's fourth year, he is amazed to feel that the hospital staff is prepared him to be shown to visitors. When he feels the visitors lay something on his chest, he realizes he is being given a medal. Joe becomes angry and shudders in his bed, trying to remove his mask to show the visitors how much damage men like him sustained in the war while generals emerged unscathed. Joe feels the vibrations of the men leaving the room. An idea comes upon him that if he can sense the outside world through vibrations, perhaps he might also communicate to the outside world with vibrations. Joe begins tapping SOS in Morse code with his head, but his regular nurse assumes that he is having seizures and sedates him.
Joe awakens from his sedation to realize that he has a new day nurse. The new day nurse tries to communicate with Joe by spelling out ""MERRY CHRISTMAS"" on his chest. Joe signals with his head that he understands, and he begins trying to tap Morse code to her. After trying to appease his tapping by making him more comfortable in various ways, the nurse eventually realizes he is trying to communicate in words.
The nurse goes to get a man who understands Morse code. This man taps onto Joe's forehead the words ""WHAT DO YOU WANT?"" Joe spends some time thinking about the inappropriateness of the question and then tries to think about what in fact it is that he wants. Joe asks in Morse code to be taken around the outside world as an educational exhibit on the realities of war. The man listens to his response and returns a while later to tap into his head, ""WHAT YOU ASK IS AGAINST REGULATIONS.""
The man continues tapping other messages, but Joe is no longer paying attention. He is still trying to process this betrayal on the part of the people for whom he fought a war when he feels the hospital staff sedating him again. Joe taps the question ""why? why? why?""—wondering why they will not let him talk or acknowledge that there is still a person inside his mangled body. Joe suddenly realizes that they are afraid to let him out, to let other men see him as the ""new messiah of the battlefields."" If other men see Joe, they would no longer agree to fight in wars—especially wars ordered by the upper classes, but fought only by the lower classes of peaceful, working men."
Marred,"Silas Marner is the weaver in the English countryside village of Raveloe in the early nineteenth century. Like many weavers of his time, he is an outsider—the object of suspicion because of his special skills and the fact that he has come to Raveloe from elsewhere. The villagers see Silas as especially odd because of the curious cataleptic fits he occasionally suffers. Silas has ended up in Raveloe because the members of his religious sect in Lantern Yard, an insular neighborhood in a larger town, falsely accused him of theft and excommunicated him.
	Much shaken after the accusation, Silas finds nothing familiar in Raveloe to reawaken his faith and falls into a numbing routine of solitary work. His one attempt at neighborliness backfires: when an herbal remedy he suggests for a neighbor’s illness works, he is rumored to be a sort of witch doctor. With little else to live for, Silas becomes infatuated with the money he earns for his work and hoards it, living off as little as possible. Every night he pulls his gold out from its hiding place beneath his floorboards to count it. He carries on in this way for fifteen years.
	Squire Cass is the wealthiest man in Raveloe, and his two eldest sons are Godfrey and Dunstan, or Dunsey. Dunsey is greedy and cruel, and enjoys tormenting Godfrey, the eldest son. Godfrey is good-natured but weak-willed, and, though secretly married to the opium addict Molly Farren, he is in love with Nancy Lammeter. Dunsey talked Godfrey into the marriage and repeatedly blackmails him with threats to reveal the marriage to their father. Godfrey gives Dunsey 100 pounds of the rent money paid to him by one of their father’s tenants. Godfrey then finds himself in a bind when Dunsey insists that Godfrey repay the sum himself. Dunsey once again threatens to reveal Godfrey’s marriage but, after some arguing, offers to sell Godfrey’s prize horse, Wildfire, to repay the loan.
	The next day, Dunsey meets with some friends who are hunting and negotiates the sale of the horse. Dunsey decides to participate in the hunt before finalizing the sale, and, in doing so, he has a riding accident that kills the horse. Knowing the rumors of Silas’s hoard, Dunsey makes plans to intimidate the weaver into lending him money. His walk home takes him by Silas’s cottage, and, finding the cottage empty, Dunsey steals the money instead.
	Silas returns from an errand to find his money gone. Overwhelmed by the loss, he runs to the local tavern for help and announces the theft to a sympathetic audience of tavern regulars. The theft becomes the talk of the village, and a theory arises that the thief might have been a peddler who came through the village some time before. Godfrey, meanwhile, is distracted by thoughts of Dunsey, who has not returned home. After hearing that Wildfire has been found dead, Godfrey decides to tell his father about the money, though not about his marriage. The Squire flies into a rage at the news, but does not do anything drastic to punish Godfrey.
	Silas is utterly disconsolate at the loss of his gold and numbly continues his weaving. Some of the townspeople stop by to offer their condolences and advice. Among these visitors, Dolly Winthrop stands out. Like many of the others, she encourages Silas to go to church—something he has not done since he was banished from Lantern Yard—but she is also gentler and more genuinely sympathetic.
	Nancy Lammeter arrives at Squire Cass’s famed New Year’s dance resolved to reject Godfrey’s advances because of his unsound character. However, Godfrey is more direct and insistent than he has been in a long time, and Nancy finds herself exhilarated by the evening in spite of her resolution. Meanwhile, Molly, Godfrey’s secret wife, is making her way to the Casses’ house to reveal the secret marriage. She has their daughter, a toddler, in her arms. Tiring after her long walk, Molly takes a draft of opium and passes out by the road. Seeing Silas’s cottage and drawn by the light of the fire, Molly’s little girl wanders through the open door and falls asleep at Silas’s hearth.
	Silas is having one of his fits at the time and does not notice the little girl enter his cottage. When he comes to, he sees her already asleep on his hearth, and is as stunned by her appearance as he was by the disappearance of his money. A while later, Silas traces the girl’s footsteps outside and finds Molly’s body lying in the snow. Silas goes to the Squire’s house to find the doctor, and causes a stir at the dance when he arrives with the baby girl in his arms. Godfrey, recognizing his daughter, accompanies the doctor to Silas’s cottage. When the doctor declares that Molly is dead, Godfrey realizes that his secret is safe. He does not claim his daughter, and Silas adopts her.
	Silas grows increasingly attached to the child and names her Eppie, after his mother and sister. With Dolly Winthrop’s help, Silas raises the child lovingly. Eppie begins to serve as a bridge between Silas and the rest of the villagers, who offer him help and advice and have come to think of him as an exemplary person because of what he has done. Eppie also brings Silas out of the benumbed state he fell into after the loss of his gold. In his newfound happiness, Silas begins to explore the memories of his past that he has long repressed.
	The novel jumps ahead sixteen years. Godfrey has married Nancy and Squire Cass has died. Godfrey has inherited his father’s house, but he and Nancy have no children. Their one daughter died at birth, and Nancy has refused to adopt. Eppie has grown into a pretty and spirited young woman, and Silas a contented father. The stone-pit behind Silas’s cottage is drained to water neighboring fields, and Dunsey’s skeleton is found at the bottom, along with Silas’s gold. The discovery frightens Godfrey, who becomes convinced that his own secrets are destined to be uncovered as well. He confesses the truth to Nancy about his marriage to Molly and fathering of Eppie. Nancy is not angry but regretful, saying that they could have adopted Eppie legitimately if Godfrey had told her earlier.
	That evening, Godfrey and Nancy decide to visit Silas’s cottage to confess the truth of Eppie’s lineage and claim her as their daughter. However, after hearing Godfrey and Nancy’s story, Eppie tells them she would rather stay with Silas than live with her biological father. Godfrey and Nancy leave, resigning themselves to helping Eppie from afar. The next day Silas decides to visit Lantern Yard to see if he was ever cleared of the theft of which he was accused years before. The town has changed almost beyond recognition, though, and Silas’s old chapel has been torn down to make way for a new factory. Silas realizes that his questions will never be answered, but he is content with the sense of faith he has regained through his life with Eppie. That summer Eppie is married to Aaron Winthrop, Dolly’s son. Aaron comes to live in Silas’s cottage, which has been expanded and refurbished at Godfrey’s expense."
Rays,"Guy Montag is a fireman who burns books in a futuristic American city. In Montag’s world, firemen start fires rather than putting them out. The people in this society do not read books, enjoy nature, spend time by themselves, think independently, or have meaningful conversations. Instead, they drive very fast, watch excessive amounts of television on wall-size sets, and listen to the radio on “Seashell Radio” sets attached to their ears.
Montag encounters a gentle seventeen-year-old girl named Clarisse McClellan, who opens his eyes to the emptiness of his life with her innocently penetrating questions and her unusual love of people and nature. Over the next few days, Montag experiences a series of disturbing events. First, his wife, Mildred, attempts suicide by swallowing a bottle of sleeping pills. Then, when he responds to an alarm that an old woman has a stash of hidden literature, the woman shocks him by choosing to be burned alive along with her books. A few days later, he hears that Clarisse has been killed by a speeding car. Montag’s dissatisfaction with his life increases, and he begins to search for a solution in a stash of books that he has stolen from his own fires and hidden inside an air-conditioning vent.
When Montag fails to show up for work, his fire chief, Beatty, pays a visit to his house. Beatty explains that it’s normal for a fireman to go through a phase of wondering what books have to offer, and he delivers a dizzying monologue explaining how books came to be banned in the first place. According to Beatty, special-interest groups and other “minorities” objected to books that offended them. Soon, books all began to look the same, as writers tried to avoid offending anybody. This was not enough, however, and society as a whole decided to simply burn books rather than permit conflicting opinions. Beatty tells Montag to take twenty-four hours or so to see if his stolen books contain anything worthwhile and then turn them in for incineration. Montag begins a long and frenzied night of reading.
Overwhelmed by the task of reading, Montag looks to his wife for help and support, but she prefers television to her husband’s company and cannot understand why he would want to take the terrible risk of reading books. He remembers that he once met a retired English professor named Faber sitting in a park, and he decides that this man might be able to help him understand what he reads. He visits Faber, who tells him that the value of books lies in the detailed awareness of life that they contain. Faber says that Montag needs not only books but also the leisure to read them and the freedom to act upon their ideas.
Faber agrees to help Montag with his reading, and they concoct a risky scheme to overthrow the status quo. Faber will contact a printer and begin reproducing books, and Montag will plant books in the homes of firemen to discredit the profession and to destroy the machinery of censorship. Faber gives him a two-way radio earpiece (the “green bullet”) so that he can hear what Montag hears and talk to him secretly.
Montag goes home, and soon two of his wife’s friends arrive to watch television. The women discuss their families and the war that is about to be declared in an extremely frivolous manner. Their superficiality angers him, and he takes out a book of poetry and reads “Dover Beach” by Matthew Arnold. Faber buzzes in his ear for him to be quiet, and Mildred tries to explain that the poetry reading is a standard way for firemen to demonstrate the uselessness of literature. The women are extremely disturbed by the poem and leave to file a complaint against Montag.
Montag goes to the fire station and hands over one of his books to Beatty. Beatty confuses Montag by barraging him with contradictory quotations from great books. Beatty exploits these contradictions to show that literature is morbid and dangerously complex, and that it deserves incineration. Suddenly, the alarm sounds, and they rush off to answer the call, only to find that the alarm is at Montag’s own house. Mildred gets into a cab with her suitcase, and Montag realizes that his own wife has betrayed him.
Beatty forces Montag to burn the house himself; when he is done, Beatty places him under arrest. When Beatty continues to berate Montag, Montag turns the flamethrower on his superior and proceeds to burn him to ashes. Montag knocks the other firemen unconscious and runs. The Mechanical Hound, a monstrous machine that Beatty has set to attack Montag, pounces and injects Montag’s leg with a large dose of anesthetic. Montag manages to destroy it with his flamethrower; then he walks off the numbness in his leg and escapes with some books that were hidden in his backyard. He hides these in another fireman’s house and calls in an alarm from a pay phone.
Montag goes to Faber’s house, where he learns that a new Hound has been put on his trail, along with several helicopters and a television crew. Faber tells Montag that he is leaving for St. Louis to see a retired printer who may be able to help them. Montag gives Faber some money and tells him how to remove Montag’s scent from his house so the Hound will not enter it. Montag then takes some of Faber’s old clothes and runs off toward the river. The whole city watches as the chase unfolds on TV, but Montag manages to escape in the river and change into Faber’s clothes to disguise his scent. He drifts downstream into the country and follows a set of abandoned railroad tracks until he finds a group of renegade intellectuals (“the Book People”), led by a man named Granger, who welcome him. They are a part of a nationwide network of book lovers who have memorized many great works of literature and philosophy. They hope that they may be of some help to mankind in the aftermath of the war that has just been declared. Montag’s role is to memorize the Book of Ecclesiastes. Enemy jets appear in the sky and completely obliterate the city with bombs. Montag and his new friends move on to search for survivors and rebuild civilization."
Lasts,"Hannah Hall, a professional woodturner living in California, receives a short cryptic note from her husband Owen Michaels, telling her to protect his teenage daughter Bailey. The message puzzles Hannah, but she soon learns that Owen has disappeared in the wake of legal raids at The Shop, the tech company where he works. He also leaves a note for Bailey, as well as a duffel bag full of money. Hannah tells no one about the notes or the money, and everyone assumes that Owen fled because he is guilty. The assessment of Owen that emerges from these events diverges from the image of the good and honest man Hannah married. Visits from federal authorities, including a US Marshal named Grady Bradford, confuse and panic her. Meanwhile, at home, Owen’s disappearance exacerbates her tense relationship with Bailey, who is furious at her father for leaving and more distant and dismissive than usual toward Hannah. 
Interspersed with Hannah’s narration about present events are flashbacks to her courtship with Owen. She recalls the sincerity of their connection and how they bonded over her work, as well as more recent memories of their married life. Her recollections of Owen show a man who loves his wife and daughter, although he is sometimes distant and avoids talking about his past and his work. Once Owen disappears, though, these memories take on new meaning, and the two women increasingly scrutinize what they know, or thought they knew, about Owen. Various clues suggest that Austin, Texas, might have played a role in Owen’s mysterious past, and Hannah increasingly believes that whatever he is fleeing from involves Austin rather than the criminal activity at The Shop. She is also convinced he disappeared to protect his daughter, not himself. 
Hannah takes Bailey to Austin in the hopes that they can learn more. Hannah hopes that visiting the city will trigger Bailey’s early memories, giving them additional clues about what happened in the past and what is happening in the present. Once there, however, Hannah and Bailey find it difficult to gather the information they need. What they know seems uncharacteristic of Owen, and Bailey’s memories remain fragmentary. Tensions erupt as Bailey antagonizes both Hannah and the friendly strangers they meet in Austin. She confronts Hannah about lying to her and extracts a promise that they will be honest with each other in the future. The two visit the University of Texas football stadium, and Bailey feels that she has been there before. They both hope the nearby Episcopal church that Bailey recognizes will provide some answers, but Elenor, the church secretary, denies that a wedding could have taken place in 2008 during the timeframe they provide. 
Hannah receives a call from Jake, a New York attorney and her former fiancé, who tells her that Owen Michaels does not exist. The information Owen shared about his background matches no known person, and he only appears in 2009. The women find this news deeply distressing, although Hannah believes that some details of Owen’s previous life exist amidst the fictions he created. His favorite college anecdote leads them to University of Texas professor Tobias Cookman. As Hannah and Bailey work through one of Tobias’s class rosters, Elenor calls to confirm that the wedding Bailey remembers did indeed occur, just earlier than they had assumed. During their research, they stumble on Katherine Smith, a classmate of Owen’s who bears an eerie resemblance to Bailey. They surmise that this woman is Bailey’s mother. 
Hannah and Bailey go to the Never Dry, a bar with a connection to Katherine. Hannah refuses to let Bailey come into the bar until they know more. At the Never Dry, she meets the owner, Charlie, and learns that Katherine is his late sister. When Hannah shows him a picture of Owen, Charlie explodes in rage. Bailey rushes in and, startled, Charlie calls her Kristin. Shaken, the women flee the bar and return to their hotel room. Hannah pieces together that Katherine had been married to Owen, then known as Ethan, and that Bailey, born Kristin, is indeed Katherine’s daughter. She also learns why Ethan became Owen. Criminal associates of Katherine’s father Nicholas, a corrupt attorney, killed her, which led Ethan to provide evidence against Nicholas that helped to send him to prison. Fearing for his daughter’s safety, Ethan changed their identities and moved to California. Hannah realizes Bailey has run away from their hotel room while she was piecing together this information.  
Grady arrives and dispatches agents to find Bailey. While they wait, he tries to convince Hannah that their safety demands that she and Bailey enter witness protection. Hannah rejects his offer, arguing that for Bailey to change her identity now will destroy her given how much she has already lost. After confirming that a piggy bank on which Owen seemed focused contained his real will, Hannah returns to the Never Dry and convinces Charlie to take her to Nicholas at his house outside Austin. During a tense negotiation, Nicholas agrees to allow Hannah and Bailey to live openly in safety—but categorically refuses to extend the same offer to Owen. Hannah and Bailey reunite at the Marshals’ office. Hannah keeps her promise not to lie to Bailey and asks her what she wants to do. Bailey chooses to go home to California with Hannah, knowing that she will not see Owen for a long time. The novel’s ending, set a few years later, reveals that Hannah and Bailey have become very close, conveyed clearly when Bailey calls Hannah “Mom.” Owen is still in hiding, even from his family, but he briefly appears at one of Hannah’s exhibitions, wearing his wedding ring. Hannah is reassured that he is the good man she always believed him to be, but, as she turns to Bailey, the novel shows that her relationship with her daughter is now the most important one in her life."
We,"Cadence, nearly eighteen, narrates her story in the first person. In Part One (“Welcome”), she describes the three generations of her family, the Sinclairs; Granddad, widowed; his three daughters, all divorced or separated from their husbands; and Cadence and her six cousins. The family spends every summer on a family-owned island. One aunt’s longtime boyfriend and his nephew, Gat, always join them there, even though Granddad doesn’t like the fact that they are of South Asian descent. Cadence, her two oldest cousins, and Gat are known in the family as “the Liars,” for unexplained reasons. Cadence and Gat fell in love when Cadence was fourteen, but the next summer there was an accident of some sort. Cadence doesn’t recall much, but apparently she suffered a head injury. She now has migraines, for which she takes prescription pain medication. None of the Liars stayed in touch with Cadence during her long recovery. The following summer, when her father took her on a trip to Europe, they didn’t reply to her emails.
In Part Two (“Vermont”), Cadence struggles to remember more of her accident. When she asks Penny for details, Penny replies tearfully that Cadence has asked many times before, and always finds the answers upsetting. When Cadence’s father wants to take her to Europe again next summer, Cadence insists on returning to the island. Her mother and father reluctantly settle on a plan for her to spend just the first month of the summer there. Meanwhile, it becomes clear during a visit from Granddad and a phone call with one of the younger cousins that all is not well with the family. Granddad’s mind is starting to fail, the younger cousins gossip about Cadence being a drug addict, and the cousin on the phone thinks the island is haunted.
Part Three (“Summer Seventeen”) begins with Cadence’s arrival at the island. To her shock, the old Victorian house where Granddad and Granny used to live has been completely rebuilt, as an unattractive modern structure. She reunites awkwardly with her aunts and the younger cousins, but her reunion with the Liars goes better, despite her resentment over not hearing from them in the last two years. The four Liars agree to stay together and not to spend much time with the rest of the family. Over the next week or two, Cadence begins to remember what happened two summers ago. Granddad and his daughters argued about the family home back in Boston. One aunt was resentful over the condition of her house on the island. Granddad also snapped at Cadence one day, about his right to do with his money as he pleased. In the present, Cadence makes progress reconnecting with the Liars, but they’re not very responsive to her questions about her accident.
In Part Four (“Look, a Fire”), Cadence starts to grasp what really happened. There had been an ugly showdown between Granddad and his daughters, about the division of the family inheritance. The fight ended with all four adults angrily leaving the island for a short time, taking the younger cousins with them. The Liars stayed behind. Since much of the family conflict had been about Granddad’s house and its contents, the Liars had deliberately burned the house down. Cadence is pleased that in the new house, Granddad and his daughters treat each other more kindly. Cadence’s feelings change, however, when she realizes that Granddad’s two dogs died in the fire. She and the other Liars are responsible for their deaths.
In Part Five (“Truth”), finally, Cadence confronts the whole truth: she alone survived the fire. The other three Liars died. They have spent the last few weeks with Cadence as ghosts, waiting for her to remember and understand. Now the Liars must leave. Cadence says final goodbyes to her two cousins and her beloved Gat. She carries with her the guilty knowledge of her role in their deaths. She is resolved to be kinder toward her surviving family from now on."
Usurp,"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern wander through a featureless wilderness, flipping coins, which keep coming up heads. Each time a coin lands on heads, Rosencrantz wins it. While Guildenstern worries about the improbability of a coin landing on heads so many times in a row, Rosencrantz happily continues flipping. Guildenstern wonders if they have entered a world where the laws of chance and time are absent. The pair struggles to recall why they are traveling and remember only that a messenger called them.
They encounter a troupe of actors, known as the Tragedians. The leader of the group, called the Player, indicates that the Tragedians specialize in sexual performances and gives Rosencrantz and Guildenstern the chance to participate for a fee. Guildenstern turns the improbable coin-flipping episode to their advantage by offering the Player a bet. The Player loses but claims he cannot pay. Guildenstern asks for a play instead. Guildenstern starts to leave as the Tragedians prepare, and Rosencrantz reveals that the most recently flipped coin landed tails-up.
The scene changes suddenly. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are now inside Elsinore, the royal castle of Denmark, watching as Hamlet and Ophelia burst onstage and leave in opposite directions. Mistaking Rosencrantz for Guildenstern, Claudius explains that he sent for the pair so that they could ascertain what is bothering Hamlet, their childhood friend.
Bewildered, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern discuss how they might probe Hamlet for the cause of his supposed madness. They play a game of question-and-answer, further confusing themselves about their purpose and even their identities. Guildenstern suggests that he pretend to be Hamlet while Rosencrantz questions him. They realize that Hamlet’s disturbed state is due to the fact that his father, the former king of Denmark, has recently died, and the throne has been usurped by Hamlet’s uncle, Claudius, who also has married Hamlet’s mother, Gertrude. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern overhear Hamlet speaking riddles to Polonius.
Hamlet confuses Rosencrantz and Guildenstern with an enigmatic speech. Polonius comes in to tell Hamlet that the Tragedians have arrived. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern despair about how little they learned of Hamlet’s feelings. They cannot decide whether he is insane.
Polonius, Hamlet, and the Tragedians enter, and Hamlet announces that there will be a play the next day. Hamlet leaves, and Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and the Player discuss the possible causes of Hamlet’s strange behavior. The Player departs while Rosencrantz and Guildenstern discuss what happens after death.
As Claudius, Gertrude, Polonius, and Ophelia enter, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern explain that Hamlet wants them all to attend the play. The group leaves, but Hamlet enters. Not noticing Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, Hamlet wonders whether he should commit suicide. Ophelia enters, praying. After a short conversation, she and Hamlet exit.
Alfred, one of the Tragedians, arrives dressed as Gertrude. The other Tragedians enter to rehearse their play, which parallels Claudius’s rise to power and marriage to Gertrude. Ophelia enters, crying, followed by an angry Hamlet, who tells her to become a nun, then quickly departs. Claudius and Polonius enter and leave with Ophelia. The Player explains the tragic aspects of the Tragedians’ play, which metaphorically retells the recent events at Elsinore and foreshadows the deaths of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. They discuss whether death can be adequately represented on stage. The scene goes black.
In darkness, voices indicate that the play has disturbed Claudius. The next day, Claudius and Gertrude ask Rosencrantz and Guildenstern to find Hamlet, who has killed Polonius. Alone again, the pair concocts a plan to trap Hamlet with their belts, but they fail as Hamlet enters from an unexpected direction and immediately leaves, carrying the dead Polonius. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern call Hamlet back, but he refuses to say what he has done with Polonius’s body. Hamlet accuses Rosencrantz and Guildenstern of being Claudius’s tools. Hamlet escapes as Claudius enters, only to be brought back onstage under guard. The scene shifts outdoors, where Guildenstern tells Rosencrantz that they have to escort Hamlet to England. Hamlet arrives in conversation with a soldier. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern reluctantly depart.
On the boat to England, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern wonder where they are and whether they might be dead. They notice Hamlet sleeping nearby, remember their mission, and consider what to do when they arrive. Guildenstern has a letter from Claudius, which reveals that Hamlet is to be executed in England. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern cannot decide what to do.
As the pair sleeps, Hamlet switches the letter they were carrying with one he has written. The next morning, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern awake and hear music coming from barrels onboard the ship. To their surprise, the Tragedians emerge from the barrels just before pirates charge the ship. Hamlet, the Player, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern jump into the barrels, and the lights go down.
When the lights come back up, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and the Player come out of the barrels. Hamlet is gone. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern tell the Player about the letter and rehearse what they will say to the English king. Guildenstern discovers that the letter now states that Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are to be executed. The Tragedians encircle the pair. Despairing about his fate, Guildenstern takes a knife from the Player and stabs him. The Player cries out and falls, apparently dead. The Tragedians clap as the Player jumps up. He says that his death was a mediocre performance while showing Guildenstern that the knife was actually a stage prop.
The Player describes the different deaths that his troupe can perform while the Tragedians act out those deaths onstage. Rosencrantz applauds, and the light shifts, leaving Rosencrantz and Guildenstern alone. Rosencrantz breaks down and leaves as he realizes his death is near. Guildenstern wonders how they were caught in this situation, lamenting that they failed to seize an opportunity to avert their fate. Guildenstern exits.
The light changes, revealing the dead bodies of Claudius, Gertrude, Hamlet, and Laertes. Horatio arrives and delivers the final speech of Shakespeare’s Hamlet, as the music rises and lights fall."
Uprooted,"Ifemelu, a Nigerian woman who lives in Princeton, New Jersey, gets her hair braided in preparation for her upcoming return to Nigeria. She has broken up with her boyfriend, Blaine, closed her popular blog about race, and uprooted her life because she feels weighed down. When she thinks of returning to Nigeria, she can’t help but think of Obinze, her first love, now a wealthy man in Lagos with a wife and daughter. Upon receiving an email from Ifemelu, Obinze becomes distracted. He has stumbled into wealth after his cousin introduces him to a well-connected man. His wife, Kosi, is beautiful and adoring, but they never connected on the emotional level that he and Ifemelu did. That night, he listens to the music he and Ifemelu used to listen to when they made love.
The novel flashes back to Ifemelu’s youth. She and Obinze meet at a party where a friend attempts to set Obinze up with a girl named Ginika. Obinze has admired Ifemelu from afar since transferring to their school, and they immediately hit it off. They date all throughout secondary school and through the start of university. However, university lecturer strikes keep closing the universities, and Obinze and Aunty Uju encourage Ifemelu to apply to school in America. Ifemelu is accepted and then quickly approved for a student visa. Ifemelu and Obinze plan to one day reunite in America. Unfortunately, Ifemelu’s student visa does not allow her to work, and without a full scholarship and stipend, Ifemelu must find a source of income. She applies to jobs using a family friend’s social security card to no avail. In desperation, she agrees to work for a shady tennis coach as his “relaxation assistant,” which involves allowing him to touch her sexually. After one meeting, she never returns to the coach. Out of shame and self-loathing, she stops replying to Obinze’s messages and emails.
Ifemelu’s luck changes when Ginika introduces her to Kimberly, a white woman who needs a babysitter. The steady work offers her a chance to focus on her studies. She meets Kimberly’s wealthy cousin, Curt, who is immediately smitten with her. They start dating, and when Ifemelu graduates, Curt helps her get a job that will sponsor her green card. For the job interview, Ifemelu needs to have her hair relaxed so that it will look professional according to American standards. The relaxer burns her scalp, and her friend Wambui encourages her to try wearing her hair natural. At first, Ifemelu thinks her hair is ugly, but soon grows to love it. One day, she runs into a friend from Nigeria, who asks what happened between her and Obinze. She gives him the cold shoulder, and is upset the rest of the day. Although she explains that the university friend was not an ex-boyfriend, Curt acts possessive.
Meanwhile, Obinze lives as an illegal immigrant in London. His American visa application was rejected because of anti-terror panic after the September 11, 2001 attacks. His mother offers to bring him as a research assistant on a trip to London as a way to get him into Britain. Obinze’s friend links him up with a fellow Nigerian, Vincent, who is willing to let him use his national insurance card in order to work if Obinze will give him a percentage of his income. Obinze agrees and finds a job in a warehouse. Eventually, Vincent demands more money. Obinze refuses, and the next day his boss tells him that someone reported him as an illegal immigrant. Desperate, Obinze tries to find someone to arrange a green card marriage for him. The day Obinze’s wedding is meant to take place, he arrives to the courthouse only to find the police awaiting him. Obinze is deported.
Ifemelu cheats on Curt and ends their relationship. After she writes an email to Wambui detailing her frustration with Curt’s inability to understand the necessity of Essence magazine in a world of beauty magazines catering to white women, Wambui suggests Ifemelu start blogging. Ifemelu starts a blog focusing on her observations on race in America as a non-American Black woman, and her clever posts soon lead to its popularity. At a conference for minority bloggers, she runs into Blaine, a Black American professor at Yale. They begin dating, and Ifemelu moves in with him. When Ifemelu does not attend a protest Blaine organizes against the university’s racial profiling of a Black staff member, they have a major fight and almost break up. However, Barack Obama’s presidential candidacy draws them back together and gives them a joint mission up until the election, and Ifemelu’s subsequent decision to leave.
Aunty Uju calls Ifemelu to tell her that her son, Dike, tried to kill himself. Ifemelu rushes to be with him. Once she’s back in Nigeria, Ifemelu slowly finds her feet. However, she is hesitant to contact Obinze. Finally, she texts him, and he wants to meet up with her as soon as possible. Their attraction is still undeniable. When Obinze asks her why she cut him off, Ifemelu tells him the story of the tennis coach, surprised at her own tears. Obinze holds her hand, and she basks in the safety she feels. After more dates, Ifemelu awkwardly rekindles their sexual relationship, although she does not want to be his mistress. They argue, and Ifemelu calls Obinze a coward for not divorcing Kosi. Shaken, Obinze thinks about Ifemelu’s accusation, and finds truth in it. He asks Kosi for a divorce. Kosi tries to ignore his declaration, reminding him that he has a duty to his family. Obinze decides that he doesn’t want his daughter to grow up with her parents only playing the roles of happy husband and wife. Days later, he shows up at Ifemelu’s flat telling her that he has left Kosi, will continue to be present in his daughter’s life, and wants to be with Ifemelu. Ifemelu invites him in."
Thrives,"In the year 2045, climate change, war and poverty have ruined most of Earth’s societies. Most people find escape and relief in the OASIS, a multiplayer online game with thousands of different locations, including games, online shopping, and even a thriving school system. Most people in the world have OASIS accounts, as there are no recurring fees and it offers an escape from the real world. The creator of the OASIS, James Halliday, has left a contest that will transfer the ownership of the OASIS and its parent company to whoever finds his Easter egg. Since the company is worth billions of dollars, many users have been trying to figure out the clues that lead to Halliday’s Easter egg for years. 
In “Level One,” Wade Watts describes his adventures trying to win Halliday’s contest. He is a high school student who lives in trailer park in Oklahoma City. Since he lives in poverty and has poor social skills, he dedicates his life to being a “gunter” (egg hunter). Since the contest was announced, no one has made any meaningful progress. Gunters are OASIS users who have not given up on finding Halliday’s Easter egg. Wade’s online avatar, Parzival, and Wade’s friend Aech spend almost all of their time looking for clues. 
Wade eventually figures out the location of the Copper Key, the first step in finding Halliday’s egg. Wade also meets a fellow gunter named Art3mis. Even though she is his competition, he has a crush on her. After acquiring the key, Wade soon passes through the First Gate. Upon doing so, his avatar becomes instantly famous across the OASIS. Art3mis, Aech, and two other gunters (Daito and Shoto) soon clear the First Gate as well. Wade is contacted by the Sixers, members of the corporation IOI, who regularly employ unfair tactics to win Halliday’s contest. Wade speaks to the leader of the Sixers, Nolan Sorrento. Sorrento threatens to kill Wade in the real world. Wade does not cooperate and the trailer where Wade’s family lives is destroyed in a large explosion. Wade warns his friends, creates a fake identity, and leaves Oklahoma City.
In “Level Two,” Wade has difficulty figuring out how to get the Jade Key, the next item in his quest. He spends more time with Art3mis and eventually professes his love for her. She breaks up with him. His friends clear the Jade Key, as do the Sixers, and eventually Aech gives him a hint. Wade acquires the Jade Key, but the Sixers have already cleared the Second Gate and have acquired the Crystal Key. Shoto contacts him and tells him that the Sixers broke into Daito’s real-world apartment and killed him. Wade eventually figures out the clues to clear the Second Gate and then acquire the Crystal Key. He also figures out the location of the Third Gate, but the Sixers are ahead of him and have set up an impenetrable barrier to its location. He gives his friends explicit instructions on how to acquire the same items and begins to formulate a dangerous plan.
In “Level Three,” Wade allows himself to be captured by IOI and sent to their indentured work program as a prisoner. Since he is using his false identity, they do not know that he is Wade/Parzival. Once inside IOI, he uses hacking resources to steal evidence of their criminal activity and set up a chain of events that will allow his group to reach the Third Gate. Wade uses his computer skills and access to escape the IOI work prison. He warns his friends that the Sixers are planning to kidnap them to win the contest. He also sends all the criminal activity that he has uncovered to every news outlet. 
Wade and his friends are contacted by Ogden Morrow, James Halliday’s original business partner, who gives them refuge from the Sixers. There is a giant battle between all the clans of gunters and the Sixers outside the third gate. The Sixers use every tactic that they can to try to stop Wade. Fighting through the Sixer soldiers, Wade enters the Third Gate. He solves more of Halliday’s puzzles and reaches Halliday’s Easter egg, just before the Sixers. He splits the winnings with his friends and meets Art3mis for the first time in the real world. They share a romantic moment, and Wade is no longer concerned with the OASIS."
Wilds,"Into the Wild contains two interconnected plots, one that involves directly represented action and another that involves the careful development of a psychological portrait of Christopher McCandless. The first plot tracks McCandless’s journey into the wild, while the second tracks the development of Krakauer’s, and, implicitly, the reader’s, understanding of McCandless’s character and motivations. Neither plot is presented in linear fashion, and the two often intersect through the presentation of subtle detail, description, and the elaboration of multiple possible lines of cause and effect. Krakauer serves as the narrator throughout the book.
Into the Wild begins with the discovery of Christopher McCandless’s body by a group of Alaskan hunters who visit Denali National Park and Preserve on a yearly excursion. They radio for help. The FBI arrives and removes the body. Krakauer then visits with Wayne Westerberg, who knew Christopher McCandless as “Alex McCandless” and who provides an initial character sketch of the young man, Krakauer in a bar in Carthage, Wisconsin. Westerberg employed McCandless on and off on his grain elevator and remembers him as engaging, intelligent, and determined. Details from McCandless’s comfortable, middle-class Virginia upbringing and his dislike of materialism further Krakauer’s understanding of the young man. These same details take the narrator back to the first leg of McCandless’s journey west in his used yellow Datsun.
Just after graduating from college, McCandless drives to Lake Mead in Nevada, where a flashflood wets the engine of the Datsun. He leaves it and a number of other possessions behind. After two months of tramping, he buys a canoe on impulse and paddles down the Colorado River to Mexico. The journey takes five months. In the meantime, the McCandless family begins investigating their son’s disappearance. After his canoeing excursion, McCandless lives and works in Bullhead City, Arizona. An old man named Charlie takes him in briefly, before McCandless departs and meets Jan Buress and her old boyfriend in California. He engages in the social life of Buress’s drifters’ camp but leaves hastily, intending to embark on his trip to Alaska. Krakauer receives a letter from and then meets Ronald Franz, who describes to Krakauer the father-son relationship he established with McCandless. The narrator uses Franz’s story to initiate a line of investigation into the harm McCandless’s risk-taking behavior caused others.
Krakauer next visits Wayne Westerberg again and reconstructs McCandless’s last month in Carthage, South Dakota by speaking with Westerberg’s girlfriend and his mother. He acquires insight into McCandless’s troubled relationship with his father and relates that in late April, 1992, McCandless sent his friends postcards revealing that he was leaving for the wild, perhaps never to return. Krakauer’s investigation then move through his revelation that many readers of his original Outdoor magazine article about McCandless thought that Christopher McCandless was an incompetent, romantic fool. In response, Krakauer embarks on the telling of the stories of three other twentieth century wilderness fanatics who disappeared or died in the wild. He evaluates each and decides that McCandless has the most in common the young artist Everett Ruess.
Back at the bus in Alaska, state troopers attempt to identify McCandless’s body. Jim Gallien reads about the finding of the corpse and then contacts the police, setting off a string of events that lead to the identification of the body. Krakauer next visits with McCandless’s family, beginning with his father, Walt McCandless, and his mother, Billie McCandless. Billie shows Krakauer photographs of Christopher’s childhood and Walt describes the heartbreak his son has caused the family. Krakauer’s investigation then picks up a new subject: McCandless’s frustration with his family. When McCandless graduated from high school, he went on a trip to California and discovered that his father had been a bigamist. Krakauer theorizes that McCandless’s anger at this long-kept family secret offers some motivation for his desire to leave his life behind.
Krakauer then dedicates two chapters to his own ascent of the Devils Thumb. These parallel the plot of McCandless’s journey. Krakauer attempts the glacier’s north face and is rebuffed, then spends three days trapped at his base camp. After accidentally setting his tent on fire, he makes a desperate attempt at the southeast face and succeeds. Recalling this story allows Krakauer conclude that Christopher McCandless must not have been suicidal when he began his trip.
Jon Krakauer’s own trip to Denali National Park and the abandoned bus where McCandless died closes out the narrative. Along with three experienced Alaskans, Krakauer crosses the same river whose flooding prevented McCandless from leaving the wild. The four hikers encounter the bus in the late evening and examine its contents. Everything seems to have been as McCandless left it. The party eats dinner and reflects on the circumstances that could have led McCandless to head into the wild. In an epilogue, the author visits the bus again with Walt and Billie McCandless, Christopher McCandless’s mother and father."
Lit,"In the midst of a raging war, a plane evacuating a group of schoolboys from Britain is shot down over a deserted tropical island. Two of the boys, Ralph and Piggy, discover a conch shell on the beach, and Piggy realizes it could be used as a horn to summon the other boys. Once assembled, the boys set about electing a leader and devising a way to be rescued. They choose Ralph as their leader, and Ralph appoints another boy, Jack, to be in charge of the boys who will hunt food for the entire group.
Ralph, Jack, and another boy, Simon, set off on an expedition to explore the island. When they return, Ralph declares that they must light a signal fire to attract the attention of passing ships. The boys succeed in igniting some dead wood by focusing sunlight through the lenses of Piggy’s eyeglasses. However, the boys pay more attention to playing than to monitoring the fire, and the flames quickly engulf the forest. A large swath of dead wood burns out of control, and one of the youngest boys in the group disappears, presumably having burned to death.
At first, the boys enjoy their life without grown-ups and spend much of their time splashing in the water and playing games. Ralph, however, complains that they should be maintaining the signal fire and building huts for shelter. The hunters fail in their attempt to catch a wild pig, but their leader, Jack, becomes increasingly preoccupied with the act of hunting.
When a ship passes by on the horizon one day, Ralph and Piggy notice, to their horror, that the signal fire—which had been the hunters’ responsibility to maintain—has burned out. Furious, Ralph accosts Jack, but the hunter has just returned with his first kill, and all the hunters seem gripped with a strange frenzy, reenacting the chase in a kind of wild dance. Piggy criticizes Jack, who hits Piggy across the face. Ralph blows the conch shell and reprimands the boys in a speech intended to restore order. At the meeting, it quickly becomes clear that some of the boys have started to become afraid. The littlest boys, known as “littluns,” have been troubled by nightmares from the beginning, and more and more boys now believe that there is some sort of beast or monster lurking on the island. The older boys try to convince the others at the meeting to think rationally, asking where such a monster could possibly hide during the daytime. One of the littluns suggests that it hides in the sea—a proposition that terrifies the entire group.
Not long after the meeting, some military planes engage in a battle high above the island. The boys, asleep below, do not notice the flashing lights and explosions in the clouds. A parachutist drifts to earth on the signal-fire mountain, dead. Sam and Eric, the twins responsible for watching the fire at night, are asleep and do not see the parachutist land. When the twins wake up, they see the enormous silhouette of his parachute and hear the strange flapping noises it makes. Thinking the island beast is at hand, they rush back to the camp in terror and report that the beast has attacked them.
The boys organize a hunting expedition to search for the monster. Jack and Ralph, who are increasingly at odds, travel up the mountain. They see the silhouette of the parachute from a distance and think that it looks like a huge, deformed ape. The group holds a meeting at which Jack and Ralph tell the others of the sighting. Jack says that Ralph is a coward and that he should be removed from office, but the other boys refuse to vote Ralph out of power. Jack angrily runs away down the beach, calling all the hunters to join him. Ralph rallies the remaining boys to build a new signal fire, this time on the beach rather than on the mountain. They obey, but before they have finished the task, most of them have slipped away to join Jack.
Jack declares himself the leader of the new tribe of hunters and organizes a hunt and a violent, ritual slaughter of a sow to solemnize the occasion. The hunters then decapitate the sow and place its head on a sharpened stake in the jungle as an offering to the beast. Later, encountering the bloody, fly-covered head, Simon has a terrible vision, during which it seems to him that the head is speaking. The voice, which he imagines as belonging to the Lord of the Flies, says that Simon will never escape him, for he exists within all men. Simon faints. When he wakes up, he goes to the mountain, where he sees the dead parachutist. Understanding then that the beast does not exist externally but rather within each individual boy, Simon travels to the beach to tell the others what he has seen. But the others are in the midst of a chaotic revelry—even Ralph and Piggy have joined Jack’s feast—and when they see Simon’s shadowy figure emerge from the jungle, they fall upon him and kill him with their bare hands and teeth.
The following morning, Ralph and Piggy discuss what they have done. Jack’s hunters attack them and their few followers and steal Piggy’s glasses in the process. Ralph’s group travels to Jack’s stronghold in an attempt to make Jack see reason, but Jack orders Sam and Eric tied up and fights with Ralph. In the ensuing battle, one boy, Roger, rolls a boulder down the mountain, killing Piggy and shattering the conch shell. Ralph barely manages to escape a torrent of spears.
Ralph hides for the rest of the night and the following day, while the others hunt him like an animal. Jack has the other boys ignite the forest in order to smoke Ralph out of his hiding place. Ralph stays in the forest, where he discovers and destroys the sow’s head, but eventually, he is forced out onto the beach, where he knows the other boys will soon arrive to kill him. Ralph collapses in exhaustion, but when he looks up, he sees a British naval officer standing over him. The officer’s ship noticed the fire raging in the jungle. The other boys reach the beach and stop in their tracks at the sight of the officer. Amazed at the spectacle of this group of bloodthirsty, savage children, the officer asks Ralph to explain. Ralph is overwhelmed by the knowledge that he is safe but, thinking about what has happened on the island, he begins to weep. The other boys begin to sob as well. The officer turns his back so that the boys may regain their composure."
Soul,"In this book, originally published in 1903, W. E. B. Du Bois has collected fourteen of his own essays about life after the Civil War, especially in the South. While the book predominantly deals with Black society and the life of “freedmen,” it also discusses how white society evolved after Emancipation. Throughout the text, Du Bois presents specific examples of racial injustice and inequality in the South. Before each essay, Du Bois includes a poem (or an excerpt from a poem or song) appropriate to the essay’s subject matter. Every inclusion is “a bar of the Sorrow Songs,—some echo of haunting melody from the only American music which welled up from the black souls in the dark past.” Du Bois revisits the significance of these inclusions at the end of the book.
While each essay examines a particular piece of the evolution of Black society, they are arranged to give the reader a historical perspective. Chapter I and Chapter II deal with the history and immediate impact of Emancipation, using historical examples and Du Bois’s own experience. Chapter III. specifically discusses the formation and responsibility of Black leadership, while criticizing Booker T. Washington on an academic level. Du Bois goes on to describe the Atlanta Compromise and the limitations it has placed on Black society in the South. Chapter IV through Chapter VII discuss the need for progress, and how it is blocked by lack of education and opportunity. He stresses that current systems produce mostly laborers, and that there is little room for Black upward mobility, especially in the South, due to a lack of education (and college-educated individuals). In Chapter VIII and Chapter IX, Du Bois describes visiting Dougherty County in rural Georgia. His first-hand experiences there are contrasted with his upbringing in New England, to show not only that there is greater disparity in the South, but also that many Black people in the South are not fully aware of it. In Chapter VI and Chapter VII, Du Bois draws on analogies to mythology to better explain the challenges he sees in the upbringing of Black men. In Chapter X., Du Bois examines the religion of the Black South. 
Chapters XI, XII, and XIII offer narrative examples of individuals Du Bois has encountered and events from Du Bois’s own life to illustrate the disparity between white and Black society. He discusses the death of his young son, pays tribute to a world-traveling preacher who remained undiscouraged, and recalls a student who had great potential but was a victim of his circumstances. Du Bois admits that these men are not well-known to history, but he considers their experiences are worthy of study. The final chapter, Chapter XIV, has several selections of “Sorrow Songs” that Du Bois describes as the “spiritual heritage of the nation.” He describes how the songs have been handed down, many from before slavery, and how they have become interconnected with religion and are still a centerpiece in Black society. 
Throughout the work, Du Bois uses historical fact and narrative example to establish how slavery and its aftereffects have shaped both Black and white society in the South. As a teacher, he then examines each situation academically. He presents cause and effect relationships and applies sociological analysis to them. The largest problem Du Bois discusses is the shortage of resources and opportunity for Black people at the beginning of the 20th century. He points out the effects of disparities in education and privilege and demonstrates the need for change."
Politician,"Marjane “Marji” Satrapi is an intelligent, spirited, and very modern girl living with her parents in Iran’s capital of Tehran during the eventful period of Iranian history from the late 1970s into the early 1980s. In Persepolis: The Story of a Childhood, Marji’s remembers her life during those years, mostly from when she was about ten to age fourteen. This account includes how Marji and her family lived through and were affected by turbulent events that included the overthrow of the autocratic Shah of Iran by the Islamic revolution, the oppressive fundamentalist regime that replaced the Shah, and the devasting Iran-Iraq war.
The nation’s wealth has long made it a target of outside invaders, but Islamic revolution of 1979 has pushed out the Western-backed government of the Shah.  The revolution has ushered in a new Islamic regime that is bringing massive societal changes impacting how people are supposed to behave--including Marji and her family. Marji struggles to adjust to the changes at her liberal French bilingual school, which has become increasingly stricter. Girls are required to wear veils and female and male students are now separated. Marji’s wealthy and modern parents—her father, Ebi, and her mother, Taji—take part in the massive protests against the new regime’s strict rules on behavior (just as they had previously protested against the Shah’s regime). Marji’s parents worry when a photo of Marji’s mother a protest appears in newspapers magazines. Later, after a demonstration they are at turns violent, the Satrapis decide that openly protesting is too dangerous to continue to do.
Marji feels conflict between her own deeply spiritual feelings and the stark modernism of her parents. She talks to God at night and has believed she will become a prophet one day since she was six years old, Marji. But the revolution leads to Marji setting aside these ambitions while she studies and imitates protestors and revolutionaries. She mimics protestors in the garden of her house and studies books about famous revolutionaries and philosophers given to her by her parents. She fantasizes about becoming a hero and wants her parents to become heroes too. Marji’s relationship with God becomes strained, as she finds that she and God have less to talk about—although God does still come by to see her from time to time.
Marji thrills when she learns that rebels fill her family history. She learns that her grandfather was a prince and later a communist whom the Shah removed from power and that her uncle Anoosh, also a communist, spent nine years in prison during the Shah’s regime. Marji spends a short time with Anoosh, learning about his life. After the Shah fell from power in 1979, Anoosh was released from prison, but when Islamic fundamentalists consolidate their grip on power, they hunt Anoosh down, imprison him, and later execute him. Her new idol killed, Marji feels crushed. She completely abandons her faith in God and increasingly questions the pro-regime propaganda she hears—especially at school.
Marji deeply loves and identifies with of her parents, even if she does sometimes feel that their actions and behavior (as wealthy and privileged individuals) do not always live up to their pro-democratic and liberal rhetoric. Marji also has a special connection with her grandmother, who remains stoic and inspiring to Marji in spite of the turmoil and numerous tragedies stemming from political actions that impact her and the family. Marji’s uncle Anoosh is not Marji’s only direct experience with the cruel consequences of the government’s actions. Throughout the book, death and devastation occurs among Marji’s extended family and friends as direct results of the brutality and fanaticism of the Iranian regimes and the war with Iraq.
People had rejoiced when the Shah was forced out, but as Islamic fundamentalists retain power, Marji and her family watch as their neighbors’ behavior shifts back and forth to coincide with the current political winds. The neighbors go from wearing short skirts and drinking alcohol to covering themselves and denouncing the use of alcohol. Marji’s parents ask her to tell everyone that she prays every day, a lie they hope will keep Marji safe, but acknowledge that the rules seem foolish. Marji grows more rebellious, as she increasingly views the rules at school and elsewhere as hypocritical and difficult to follow. Armed with more knowledge and personal experience, Marji begins to act out in ways that put her safety at risk. In fact, she even (accidentally) hits her principal during an argument, which results in her expulsion from school. Fearing her rebellious behavior will get her killed, Marji’s mother tries to reason with Marji by telling her that it is not her responsibility to serve justice and that the bad guys eventually pay for their sins in the end.
The war with Iraq had originally inspired Marji to vocal patriotism in protection her country against another invasion, but Marji begins to realize there are greater forces behind the war. She sees how the Islamic regime needs the war to continue survive and keep power. The war promotes a sense of nationalism and pride in the public, and those who die in the war are hailed as “martyrs.” Marji sees thousands of poor boys lured into war without proper training. She becomes increasingly uncomfortable and aware of class differences within society. Poor young boys are lured into the army with gold-painted keys to the “kingdom of heaven” to help them enter paradise after dying on the battlefield, while children in her wealthy neighborhood are left alone.
More and more people try to escape Iran as the borders tighten and Iraqi forces bomb Tehran and other Iranian cities. Realizing that Marji’s chances of escaping Iran are narrowing, her parents make the difficult decision to send her abroad alone to finish school in Vienna, explaining that only a good education will free her of Iran. Marji feels heartbroken. She spends one last night with her grandmother, who gives her warm advice and inspires her to be compassionate and understanding while in Vienna. Marji gives away all of her prized contraband to her friends, including a Kim Wilde poster. At the airport, as Marji turns to say goodbye to her parents one last time to see that her mother, devasted by her only child’s departure, has fainted."
Staple,"Shabanu lives with her mother, father, older sister, grandfather, aunt, and young cousins in a compound of mud huts near the border between Pakistan and India. They own a herd of fine camels, and as long as there is water in the nearby pond (called a ""toba""), they live a proud and free existence in the windswept desert of Pakistan. Once a year, they attend a fair in Sibi, which lies across the desert and where they sell their camels in order to buy goods they need. When the toba dries up, they move to nearby villages with deep wells. When this happens, they wait eagerly for rain to fill the toba, which will allow them to move back to their beloved desert home.
Shabanu regards her older sister, Phulan, with disdain and envy. Phulan is beautiful and graceful. Her parents have promised her to a young man, Hamir, in a nearby farming village. The wedding will take place in the summer, when the monsoon rains come. Shabanu has been promised to this young man's brother, Murad, but as she is younger, her wedding is still far off. Shabanu loves her life in the desert. Her parents are gentle and indulgent. She adores the camels of their herd. She is especially proud of Guluband, a great and intelligent beast, who dances when he hears music.
Shabanu and her father travel across the desert lands to the fair at Sibi. Their sales at Sibi this year are especially important, as they will help pay for Phulan's dowry. At Sibi, Guluband is by far the best camel. Many people want to buy him, but Dadi refuses to sell him. An Afghani soldier, who will subject the poor camel to the conditions of war, shows special interest in Guluband. Dadi names an exorbitant price, and the man storms off. Dadi sells the rest of the herd quite successfully. However, the next day, the soldier returns with all the money for which Dadi had asked. Dadi must sell him the camel. Shabanu feels betrayed and crushed.
Dadi and Shabanu return home. The family prepares for the wedding by buying and sewing beautiful clothes and making a pilgrimage to Channan Pir. Women pray for sons and good marriages at this holy shrine. At Channan Pir, the women of the family meet Mama's bold cousin, Sharma, and her daughter, Fatima. Sharma left her abusive husband for a simple but independent existence in the desert, raising goats and sheep. Shabanu looks up to Sharma and often wishes that she could steal away to live a wild and free life in the desert with Sharma and Fatima. Sharma loves Shabanu, but she insists that Shabanu is lucky to be betrothed to such a gentle and upstanding young man.
When they return from Channan Pir, a dust storm whirls up. Grandfather, who is old and often unaware of his surroundings, wanders off into the storm before anyone notices. When they find him the next morning, he is near death. He begs them to take him to Derawar, a fort where he will receive a burial befitting a soldier. The family travels to Derawar, but eventually must bury him in a humble grave at the edges of town. As the dust storm has filled the toba, the family sets out for Mehrabpur, where Hamir's family lives.
Hamir's family bought their patch of land from a greedy landowner named Nazir Mohammad. The family labored over the land and it became rich and fertile. Nazir Mohammad is trying to force the family to give him part of their crops, claiming they did not actually buy the land from him. One evening, Shabanu and Phulan are fetching water when they come across Nazir Mohammad and his friends. They see the girls and plan to take Phulan and rape her. Shabanu throws the water pots at the men, sweeps Phulan up onto a camel, and rides home. Dadi sends the women off toward Derawar, fearful of Nazir Mohammad. He runs to tell Hamir what has happened. Hamir becomes violently angry, and when Nazir Mohammad appears shortly thereafter, Hamir attempts to shoot him. Nazir Mohammad kills Hamir.
The Desert Rangers find the women and take them to a nearby post, where the families will gather to settle the dispute. Nazir Mohammad's brother, Rahim- sahib, is a politician and wants to settle the dispute quickly. At the ranger post, Hamir's family, Shabanu's family, and Rahim- sahib talk far into the night. The next day, they announce the settlement: Phulan will marry Murad right away, Nazir Mohammad will leave the family alone, and Rahim-sahib, who met Shabanu briefly in the courtyard, will take Shabanu as his fourth wife.
Shabanu is devastated. She numbly endures Phulan's wedding. Sharma, however, draws her aside. She counsels Shabanu to learn to manipulate and control the doting man, to remain true to herself, to keep her heart hidden from him, and, if all else fails, to escape and join her and Fatima in the desert.
After the wedding, the family returns to their home in the desert. Shabanu tries to reconcile herself to her future. When her period starts, she hides it from her parents, as she knows she must marry soon after. When her father finds out she has hidden something from him, he is livid: her secretive and rebellious behavior does not befit a woman. Shabanu quickly decides to leave for Sharma's that very night.
When her parents are asleep, she slips out and climbs atop a camel. One of her favorite young camels insists on following her. She rides all night and is almost assured of freedom, when the young camel falls and breaks his leg. She knows that if she leaves the camel, predators will attack and kill him. Rather than leave him, she waits, knowing Dadi will find them in a few hours. When he does, he beats her violently. Shabanu stands silently under his attack. She resigns herself to her fate, but she carefully guards her inner happiness in her heart."
Princes,"The narrator, an airplane pilot, crashes in the Sahara desert. The crash badly damages his airplane and leaves the narrator with very little food or water. As he is worrying over his predicament, he is approached by the little prince, a very serious little blond boy who asks the narrator to draw him a sheep. The narrator obliges, and the two become friends. The pilot learns that the little prince comes from a small planet that the little prince calls Asteroid 325 but that people on Earth call Asteroid B-612. The little prince took great care of this planet, preventing any bad seeds from growing and making sure it was never overrun by baobab trees. One day, a mysterious rose sprouted on the planet and the little prince fell in love with it. But when he caught the rose in a lie one day, he decided that he could not trust her anymore. He grew lonely and decided to leave. Despite a last-minute reconciliation with the rose, the prince set out to explore other planets and cure his loneliness.
While journeying, the narrator tells us, the little prince passes by neighboring asteroids and encounters for the first time the strange, narrow-minded world of grown-ups. On the first six planets the little prince visits, he meets a king, a vain man, a drunkard, a businessman, a lamplighter, and a geographer, all of whom live alone and are overly consumed by their chosen occupations. Such strange behavior both amuses and perturbs the little prince. He does not understand their need to order people around, to be admired, and to own everything. With the exception of the lamplighter, whose dogged faithfulness he admires, the little prince does not think much of the adults he visits, and he does not learn anything useful. However, he learns from the geographer that flowers do not last forever, and he begins to miss the rose he has left behind.
At the geographer’s suggestion, the little prince visits Earth, but he lands in the middle of the desert and cannot find any humans. Instead, he meets a snake who speaks in riddles and hints darkly that its lethal poison can send the little prince back to the heavens if he so wishes. The little prince ignores the offer and continues his explorations, stopping to talk to a three-petaled flower and to climb the tallest mountain he can find, where he confuses the echo of his voice for conversation. Eventually, the little prince finds a rose garden, which surprises and depresses him—his rose had told him that she was the only one of her kind.
The prince befriends a fox, who teaches him that the important things in life are visible only to the heart, that his time away from the rose makes the rose more special to him, and that love makes a person responsible for the beings that one loves. The little prince realizes that, even though there are many roses, his love for his rose makes her unique and that he is therefore responsible for her. Despite this revelation, he still feels very lonely because he is so far away from his rose. The prince ends his story by describing his encounters with two men, a railway switchman and a salesclerk.
It is now the narrator’s eighth day in the desert, and at the prince’s suggestion, they set off to find a well. The water feeds their hearts as much as their bodies, and the two share a moment of bliss as they agree that too many people do not see what is truly important in life. The little prince’s mind, however, is fixed on returning to his rose, and he begins making plans with the snake to head back to his planet. The narrator is able to fix his plane on the day before the one-year anniversary of the prince’s arrival on Earth, and he walks sadly with his friend out to the place the prince landed. The snake bites the prince, who falls noiselessly to the sand.
The narrator takes comfort when he cannot find the prince’s body the next day and is confident that the prince has returned to his asteroid. The narrator is also comforted by the stars, in which he now hears the tinkling of his friend’s laughter. Often, however, he grows sad and wonders if the sheep he drew has eaten the prince’s rose. The narrator concludes by showing his readers a drawing of the desert landscape and by asking us to stop for a while under the stars if we are ever in the area and to let the narrator know immediately if the little prince has returned."
Ascertained,"As a huntress and her family’s primary source of survival, nineteen-year-old Feyre stalks the bleak woods, a little farther from home than usual. Her family was once very wealthy, but they now live in poverty. Feyre’s luck turns when she spots a deer. At the same time, an enormous wolf appears out of nowhere. Feyre wonders if the wolf is a faerie in disguise. She hates faeries for all the harm they have done to humans. Feyre decides to use a precious ash arrow, a surefire method to kill a faerie, just in case. She fires the arrow as the wolf attacks the deer, killing the beast. The next evening, a golden beast bursts through the door of her family’s rundown cottage. The beast reveals that the wolf was indeed a faerie named Andras. The beast demands payment for his death under the terms of the Treaty between the human and faerie realms. The beast gives Feyre a choice: he can kill her now, or she can follow him to the faerie realm of Prythian to live out the rest of her days. Feyre chooses to live. 
In Prythian, Feyre learns the golden beast is a High Fae called Tamlin. He is the High Lord of the Spring Court. Tamlin and all the faeries in his court wear permanent masks on their faces due to an affliction called the blight. At first, Feyre is determined to escape Prythian, but she soon becomes accustomed to her new home. She learns about its history and magic and that much of what she was raised to believe about faeries, including their inability to lie and their aversion to iron, are myths. Feyre develops an affection for Alis, her lady-in-waiting, and Lucien, Tamlin’s best friend. Tamlin encourages her to explore her love for painting and to improve her reading skills. He reveals that he has ensured her family is well cared for in the human realm. Romantic and sexual tension grows between them. Although Feyre finds Prythian beautiful, it is full of dangerous creatures and intrigue. The blight makes life in Prythian increasingly perilous. After a threatening visit from a High Fae named Rhysand, Tamlin believes Feyre is no longer safe in Prythian and decides to send her back to the human realm. The night before she leaves, they make love. Tamlin tells Feyre that he loves her. Though she loves him too, she cannot bring herself to speak the words aloud.  
Feyre returns to the human realm to find that Tamlin was true to his word. Her family is extremely wealthy and well cared for. Her father and sisters have been glamoured, or tricked with faerie magic, and know nothing about faeries or how their wealth was restored. They believe Feyre has been away caring for a sick aunt. Soon, her sister Nesta reveals the glamour did not work on her. After Feyre was taken to Prythian, Nesta searched for her but was unable to cross the wall between the human and faerie realms. Nesta also reveals she is still angry at their father for not trying harder to save their mother’s life. Nesta’s words inspire Feyre to fight harder for Tamlin and she sets off for Prythian to fight the blight alongside him.  
When Feyre arrives at the Spring Court, Tamlin’s manor house is in shambles. Alis is the only one left. Alis reveals that the blight is a euphemism that refers to Amarantha, the High Queen of Prythian. Amarantha is an interloper who took Prythian over by force. She stole the powers of the High Fae and placed a curse on Tamlin that could only be broken by a woman who hated the fae declaring her love for him. Since Feyre never told Tamlin she loved him, the curse remained. The curse prevented the faeries from telling Feyre the truth, so they used the blight to explain their masks and other conflicts. Alis can tell Feyre this because Amarantha has relaxed part of the curse, believing she’s already won, but there is still one aspect of the curse Alis cannot reveal. When Alis explains that Tamlin and Lucien are Amarantha’s captives, Feyre decides to go after them. 
Feyre journeys to Amarantha’s faerie court Under the Mountain, where she becomes a captive as well. Amarantha gives her the chance to save Tamlin by completing three tasks or by solving a riddle. For the first task, Feyre uses her hunting skills to escape a giant worm in a labyrinth. As the faeries place bets and watch in amusement, the only one to bet on Feyre is Rhysand. After, he heals her broken arm. In exchange, Feyre agrees to spend a week every month with him in the Night Court. For the second task, Feyre must successfully solve a puzzle and choose the right lever or she and Lucien will be impaled and crushed. She makes the correct choice with the aid of Rhysand’s voice in her head. In the meantime, Rhysand parades Feyre around as his escort at parties. 
For the third task, Feyre must stab three faeries in the heart with ash wood daggers. Despite her guilt, she knows it’s the only way to break the curse. She stabs the first two faeries, but when the hood is removed from the third one, it is Tamlin. At first, Feyre believes she must kill the man she loves until she remembers two conversations about Tamlin’s heart of stone. She believes this means Tamlin’s heart is literally made of stone so he cannot be harmed by the dagger. Knowing Amarantha wants Tamlin for herself and doesn’t want to see him killed, Feyre plunges the dagger into Tamlin’s chest. She is correct, but Amarantha refuses to break the curse based on a technicality. In a rage, Amarantha beats Feyre almost to death. Feyre finally realizes the answer to Amarantha’s riddle is the word love. She speaks the solution aloud and the curse breaks just as Feyre dies. With the curse broken, Tamlin and Rhysand join forces to destroy Amarantha. One by one, the six High Lords gift Feyre with healing light and immortality. Tamlin sets a bit of this golden light on her heart, resurrecting Feyre and transforming her into one of the High Fae. Feyre and Tamlin are finally free, but Feyre must reckon with her new life and the lives she took to bring them to this point."
Faced,"Lawyer Bryan Stevenson gives a first-person account of his decades helping marginalized Americans who have been unfairly and harshly punished by the U.S. criminal justice system, which disproportionately targets people of color and poor people. At the heart of Just Mercy is the story of Walter McMillian, a Black man who was framed for the murder of a girl named Ronda Morrison, convicted, and sent to death row. 
Stevenson alternates chapters about Walter with his personal reflections on our country’s history with racial disparity and issues around incarceration. Stevenson highlights other groups of vulnerable people who have been victimized by the criminal justice system and shares the stories of the prisoners he has helped over the years. The book also follows the growth of Stevenson’s nonprofit law project, the Alabama-based Equal Justice Initiative (EJI), through its expansion from focusing on death row prisoners to helping people sentenced to life without parole. Stevenson chronicles how EJI becomes a significant force in criminal justice reform.
In 1983 as a law student, Stevenson discovers his life’s passion when he interns with the Georgia-based Southern Prisoners Defense Committee and meets his first death row prisoner. After graduation Stevenson accepts a job with the organization to represent poor prisoners, including those in Alabama who lack any public defender. He meets Walter McMillian on Alabama’s death row. Walter owns a successful business but also transgresses racial boundaries when he has an affair with a white woman. Soon after the affair becomes public, the woman’s friend, Ralph Myers, accuses Walter of committing the unsolved murder of Ronda Morrison, which has outraged the community. Law enforcement, including a racist sheriff and the district attorney, eagerly pounces on this accusation, overlooking Walter’s alibi and a lack of evidence. Instead, they actively force Ralph to stick with his story even when he tries to recant. They coerce other false witness testimonies, and—as revealed years later—actively suppress evidence.
After Stevenson and the team at EJI unsuccessfully appeal Walter’s conviction, they launch their own investigation of the crime and uncover new evidence. They find witnesses who can prove the witnesses against Walter lied as well as financial records that indicate that one of these witnesses was paid to give false testimony. Stevenson and his team also petition for and receive all records from Walter’s trial. However, their big break comes when they receive a phone call from Ralph, who now wants to make amends. Ralph admits to lying about Walter and says he was threatened by law enforcement. Stevenson wins a hearing for Walter where he can present his new evidence: Ralph’s testimony, which is confirmed by health care workers and other inmates, as well as recordings of the law enforcement team threatening Ralph if he doesn’t frame Walter. 
While the judge refuses to grant Walter relief, Stevenson continues the appeal process through the Alabama courts. The district attorney asks outside agents to investigate the murder for which Walter was convicted, and the investigators determine that Walter had nothing to do with the crime. Six weeks later, the court invalidates Walter’s conviction. Stevenson and the State file a joint motion to dismiss the charges, and Walter is set free.
Throughout the process, Stevenson and Walter become close friends, and Stevenson helps Walter upon his release, including filing a civil suit on his behalf and offering him a place to stay. Walter works with Stevenson to share his story, giving interviews and speaking at legal conferences, and Walter is even featured in a documentary. Unfortunately, Walter is diagnosed with advancing dementia and is forced to rely on family and eventually a nursing facility for his care. He dies in 2013. Stevenson gives a eulogy at his funeral and shares all he learned from Walter, particularly that we must extend mercy to everyone, even those who have not earned it.
Interspersed with chapters chronicling Walter’s narrative are stories of Stevenson’s other clients and work. His closeness with these prisoners and their horrifying circumstances makes Stevenson more determined to help and causes him to reflect on abstract issues that nevertheless imbue the criminal justice system, like humanity and mercy. Stevenson focuses on several categories of vulnerable people who become trapped in the system, including mentally ill prisoners, disabled prisoners, and poor women who give birth to stillborn babies. 
Stevenson and his team at EJI also become increasingly focused on juvenile offenders who are sometimes tried as adults despite their young age. These offenders may be given de facto death sentences by being sentenced to life without parole and face perilous circumstances when they are housed in adult prisons. Stevenson illustrates how these prisoners retain their own humanity while being forced to live under inhumane conditions. He also discusses some of the qualities common among these types of prisoners: They are generally poor and disproportionately people of color, and most of them lack adequate legal counsel. The juveniles have horrific backgrounds of abuse and neglect.
Stevenson and his team at EJI also work to change the legal system to offer more protection to marginalized people. Several of his cases end up before the U.S. Supreme Court, and he succeeds in winning rulings that ban as unconstitutional the conviction of children to life without parole and the execution of people deemed incompetent from dementia or neurological disease. EJI works to raise public awareness of issues surrounding unfair incarceration, produces groundbreaking reports on racial issues, and sets up programs to help formerly incarcerated people adjust to life on the outside.
Stevenson also reflects on the issues that surround the criminal justice system. His time spent with prisoners awaiting their execution makes him realize how inhumane it is to prepare another human to die. After decades of work, when Stevenson fails to prevent the execution of a man who suffers from an intellectual disability, he momentarily feels unable to continue his work. However, he realizes that he cannot help but be broken by his experiences and comes to understand that it is his own brokenness that allows him to more fully understand the need for mercy and to bring compassion to others. The book ends with Stevenson’s renewed commitment to helping others."
Writer,"Lamott begins Bird by Bird with an introduction describing her lifelong love of books and her father’s influence on her life and writing. Although she often wished that her father had a “regular” job like other fathers, she gradually began to realize that being a writer was the best job for him. She eventually followed in his footsteps. At an early age, Lamott realized that she possessed an uncanny ability to write engaging and often funny stories. But even with this ability, she was not an instant success as a writer. When her father fell ill with brain cancer, she was inspired to write about her family’s struggles. Her father’s agent accepted her manuscript, which was eventually published, and Lamott has worked as a writer ever since. She wrote Bird by Bird in order to share with the reader everything she knows about writing.
In Part One, Lamott addresses the daunting task of beginning to write. She talks about how writers should strive to write at the same time every day and urges them to give themselves short, discrete assignments rather than long, complicated ones. She keeps a one-inch picture frame on her desk that reminds her to write about small things in detail before embarking on large projects. Often, these small exercises lead to valuable writing material, as in her anecdote about school lunches. In the writing exercise that describes a lunch preparation, Lamott explains how the process of writing about mundane details provides the seeds of an interesting story. Lamott also encourages writers to give themselves permission to write imperfect first drafts, since this is an integral part of story development. Self-criticism and perfectionism can be writers’ worst enemies, but writers must somehow continue to write even as self-doubt plagues them. Lamott finds it helpful to believe in God or another higher power when fighting these enemies, and her spirituality permeates Bird by Bird.
Lamott then addresses the more technical details of writing, comparing the process of writing to the slow development of a Polaroid picture. Characters develop organically, and writers must foster this development by loving each of their characters. Each character should be readily identifiable by what he or she says, and in most cases the narrator should be a lovable figure. Also, good dialogue is integral to a story. Plot should develop from character, and writers shouldn’t try to cram characters into plots that don’t suit them. She points out that a good plot treatment (i.e., a brief summation of what happens in the story) can be a valuable tool for a story that is in trouble. She recalls a book of hers that was rejected by her editor even after multiple revisions. Only when she described the plot treatment did her editor understand the problem: the story that existed on paper was far different from the one that existed in Lamott’s head. 
Part Two examines “The Writing Frame of Mind.” Lamott implores writers to remain aware of and reverent toward the world around them. She also states that good writing must be moral. By this she means that one’s writing must be driven by one’s deepest beliefs, as it is this level of passion that creates the best writing. Lamott calls the critical voices in her head Radio Station KFKD (a name that becomes hilarious when pronounced aloud) and frequently concentrates on silencing them. These voices can lead to jealousy, a trait which she denounces as one of the worst handicaps a writer can possess. Jealousy of other writers—or anyone else—is counterproductive and should be avoided at all costs.
In Part Three, Lamott emphasizes the importance of community in writing. She thinks that writer’s groups can be a good source of community, but that they can also be hotbeds of criticism. Writers must be extremely discriminating when deciding with whom to share their writing. She stresses the importance of having another person read your writing. Someone else’s input is extremely valuable, especially for beginning writers. When her students are stumped, she suggests that they write to friends and family about important events in their lives. This exercise often triggers important memories that can serve as fodder for writing. Finally she addresses the curse of writer’s block: patience and faith are the only real cures. A block will always pass, she believes. 
In Part Four, Lamott reminds her readers that their writing can be a gift. She frequently uses writing in her own life in order to memorialize someone for whom she cares deeply. She discusses her writing as a reaction to the deaths of her father and her friend Pam. Writing about these events helped her come to terms with her grief. Lamott goes on to demand that her students find their own voice. Her students often mimic famous writers, which prohibits them from writing truthfully. She implores them not to shy away from detailing the more uncomfortable moments in their lives; in fact, it is these moments that often lead to the best writing. Briefly, Lamott touches on the much-hyped process of publishing. She recalls her intense anxieties during the process of publishing and notes that while there are some pleasurable moments, publication itself is not enough to make a writer happy. 
Lamott concludes that being a writer is the best life she can imagine. For her, the best thing about being a writer is the pride she feels at producing such satisfying work. Writing feeds Lamott’s soul and helps her to love the world. Bird by Bird expresses her desire to share the joy that writing brings to her life."
Kinder,"On June 9, 1976, it is the twenty-sixth birthday of Dana, a young Black woman. She and Kevin Franklin, her white husband, move into their new apartment in Southern California. Dana does the majority of the unpacking and settling in; Kevin focuses on his office and then stops helping. Dana gets dizzy, and her surroundings fade away. When she comes to, she finds herself in the early 1800s in Maryland. A young white boy named Rufus is struggling in a river. Dana wades in after him, but he is unconscious by the time she reaches him. She drags him to the shore and resuscitates him. Tom Weylin, Rufus’s father, arrives and points a gun at Dana, terrifying her. Following another dizzy spell, she reappears in her apartment in 1976.
Several minutes later, Dana again gets dizzy and disappears. This time, she is whisked back to 1815. Rufus, now a few years older, watches in horror as his bedroom drapes burn. He had set fire to them because he was angry with his father for selling a horse he wanted. Dana puts out the fire, talks to Rufus, and escapes from the house before Weylin finds out she is there. She runs to the home of Alice Greenwood and her mother, free Balck people who Dana suspects may be her ancestors. A group of young white men smash down the Greenwoods’ door, drag out Alice’s husband, who is a slave, and beat him. They also beat Alice’s mother. After the men leave, Dana comes out of hiding and helps Alice’s mother. Dana steps outside, and a returning white man finds her, beats her, and attempts to rape her. Dana fears for her life. Following another dizzy spell, she returns home to her own time.
The next time Dana time travels, Kevin comes with her by holding onto her. Back at the Weylins’, Rufus has fallen out of a tree and broken his leg. Nigel, a young Black boy, runs for help, and Weylin comes with his slave, Luke. Rufus will not let Dana leave, so everyone returns to the house together. Kevin and Dana stay on the plantation for several weeks and help educate Rufus. But when Dana gets caught teaching Nigel to read, Weylin whips her. Dana returns to 1976, but Kevin does not arrive in time to go with her.
After eight days at home, Dana time travels back and finds that Kevin has left the Maryland area and that Rufus has raped Alice Greenwood. Alice’s husband, Isaac, a slave, is beating Rufus badly. Dana convinces Isaac not to kill Rufus, and Alice and Isaac run away while Dana gets Rufus home. She stays in Maryland for two months. Although Rufus lies about how he got injured, Alice and Isaac are caught, and Alice is beaten and ravaged by dogs. As punishment for helping Isaac escape, Alice is made a slave. Rufus, who is in love with Alice, buys her. He forces Dana to convince Alice to sleep with him after her body has recovered. After Rufus fails to mail her letters to Kevin, Dana attempts to run away. As a result, she receives a vicious whipping, which so hurts and frightens her that she loses the will to run away again. Kevin shows up, as Weylin had written to him, and the couple attempts to escape. Rufus catches them on the road and shoots at them, but they manage to time travel together back to the 1970s.
After a few days, Dana time travels by herself back to Maryland and finds Rufus very drunk and lying facedown in a puddle. Weylin refuses to get a doctor. Over the course of many days, Dana nurses Rufus back to health. Rufus remains weak for weeks. Weylin has a heart attack, and Dana is unable to save him. Rufus blames her for his father’s death and forces her to work in the fields until she collapses.
Rufus is much harsher with Alice than he is with Dana. Alice is jealous of the kindness with which Rufus treats Dana. Alice gives birth to her second child with Rufus, Hagar, who is Dana’s direct ancestor. She tells Dana that she plans to run away as soon as she can. She fears that she is getting too used to Rufus, that she doesn’t hate him enough anymore. Weylin’s wife, Margaret, returns. Dana is forced to care for her. Rufus sells off some slaves, including Tess, his father’s former consort. He also sells Sam, a field hand, as punishment for flirting with Dana. When Dana tries to interfere, Rufus hits her. She slits her wrists in an effort to time travel and is successful.
Dana is back at home for many days. She and Kevin quarrel a little about Rufus. Kevin is jealous of his relationship with Dana, which Dana finds ridiculous. When Dana returns to the plantation, she finds that Alice has attempted to run away. To retaliate, Rufus told her that he sold her children, although actually he only sent them off to live with his aunt in Baltimore. Alice is sick with grief and eventually kills herself. Racked with guilt and anger about Alice’s death, Rufus nearly kills himself. He keeps Dana at his side almost constantly. One day, he tells her that she is so like Alice he cannot stand it. He catches her by the wrists, and Dana struggles free. She goes to the attic, planning to slit her wrists in order to get home, but Rufus follows her and attempts to rape her. Dana stabs him twice with her knife, killing him. She returns home immediately. Her arm is severed and crushed in the spot where Rufus was holding it."
Bolivar,"Looking for Alaska tells the story of Miles “Pudge” Halter, a high school junior who divides his life into time before and time after a life-changing event that the reader will not discover until later in the novel. 
Miles plans to attend the Culver Creek boarding school for his junior year of high school. Although his parents worry that Miles wants to attend the school because he does not have friends at his current school, Miles reveals that he is actually influenced by the last words of the poet François Rabelais about “seeking the Great Perhaps.” He moves to Birmingham, Alabama to attend Culver Creek and becomes friends with his roommate, Chip “The Colonel” Martin. Chip teaches Miles about the social structure of the school. He explains that the wealthy students that go home to their parents’ mansions every weekend (the “Weekday Warriors”) do not get along with his friend group. 
Chip introduces Miles to his friend Alaska, and Miles is quickly enamored by her. While Miles is obsessed with people’s final words and wants to seek François Rabelais’s “Great Perhaps,” Alaska enjoys books and wants to know the nature of “the labyrinth of suffering” that Simón Bolívar evoked in his final words.
The Weekday Warriors sneak into Chip and Miles’s dorm on Miles’s first night and throw Miles into the lake with his limbs bound by tape. Chip and Miles discover that this action was taken in retaliation for Chip supposedly ratting out their friends—a couple named Marya and Paul—and getting them expelled the previous year. Miles, Chip, Alaska, and another friend, Takumi, begin planning a revenge prank. Miles becomes part of their friend group and starts smoking cigarettes. The four of them get caught smoking and Alaska and Chip cover for Miles and Takumi, demonstrating to Miles that you cover for your friends instead of ratting them out. 
Miles settles into his new school and does well in his classes because he spends so much time studying. Alaska decides she will find Miles a girlfriend, and eventually introduces him to a Romanian student named Lara. Miles embarrasses himself on the first group date at a basketball game with Alaska, Alaska’s boyfriend Jake, Chip, Chip’s girlfriend Sara, Takumi, and Lara. Miles is hit by a basketball, gets concussed, and then vomits on Lara. Afterward, Miles tries to talk to Alaska, but is confused when Alaska becomes moody and short with him for no apparent reason.
The Weekday Warriors target Alaska with a prank, reminding Chip and Alaska they need to work on their own revenge prank. Takumi reveals to Miles that it was actually Alaska who ratted out the couple who were expelled the previous year. Takumi warns Miles that he cannot rat anyone else out if he gets caught carrying out the revenge prank. Miles is still infatuated with Alaska and asks his parents to let him stay at school over Thanksgiving break so he can be with her. Although he knows she has a boyfriend, Miles wants to be with Alaska. They ultimately spend Thanksgiving Day with Chip and his mom.
Lara joins Alaska, Chip, Takumi, and Miles as they execute their revenge prank on the Weekday Warriors. They set off fireworks and put dye in the Weekday Warriors’ hair products. They also get on the computer of the Dean (whom they call “the Eagle”) to send bad grade reports to the parents of the Weekday Warriors. The five of them spend the remainder of the night and weekend camping and hiding in a barn on campus as their alibi is that they were all off campus. They play a drinking game and Alaska reveals that, as a child, she saw her mom die of an aneurysm and did not call an ambulance because she thought her mom was just sleeping. When they quit playing the drinking game, Miles kisses Lara. He asks if she wants to be his girlfriend and she says yes. 
Miles spends time with Lara despite not having much to talk about, but they are physically intimate. He leaves Lara to spend time with Alaska and Chip in his room, watching them as they get drunk. Alaska dares Miles to make out with her. He does and she tells him it is to be continued in the future. They all go to sleep. Chip and Miles are startled awake later by Alaska frantically telling them she needs to leave because she had forgotten something. They provide a distraction for the Eagle so she can get in her car and drive away unnoticed.
The Eagle calls an assembly to announce to the student body that Alaska has died. Miles asks what happened and is informed that she drove straight into a police cruiser with its lights and sirens on, likely due to driving while intoxicated. Both Chip and Miles feel responsible for her death because they helped her drive away when they knew she was drunk. They mourn in different ways and attend Alaska’s funeral.
Miles and Chip go through Alaska’s room to see if there is anything they want to keep. They find a note she wrote in one of her books that said “straight and fast” was the way out of the labyrinth of suffering. This revelation makes Chip and Miles think she may have killed herself. Chip is eager to investigate her death and Miles reluctantly agrees to help. 
Religion class becomes more important to Miles after Alaska’s death because its subject matter becomes more real. Chip and Miles vent their anger to each other that so many people who did not know Alaska like they did are mourning her death. Chip leads their investigation into Alaska’s death. 
Chip and Miles interview the police officer who saw Alaska crash. Their interview supports their belief that she killed herself, so they research suicide warning signs. They do not remember Alaska exhibiting many of the warning signs and continue their investigation. Meanwhile, Miles avoids Lara. Takumi questions Miles about whether he is still dating Lara, and Takumi demands that Chip and Miles tell him about what they have been doing. They agree to tell him about their investigation in the future. 
Chip plans to see if Alaska might have been unable to swerve because of how drunk she was. He and Miles steal a breathalyzer from the Eagle and Chip drinks enough alcohol to match Alaska’s blood alcohol level at her time of death. He believes she would have been able to swerve, so he plans to call Jake, Alaska’s boyfriend, as a final effort. Miles is against calling Jake, but Chip does it anyway. They learn that Alaska told Jake that she would call him later, which further confuses the question of whether she killed herself or not.
Chip and Miles do not know what to investigate next, so they turn their attention to planning a prank in memory of Alaska. Chip pulls out plans Alaska had made for a prank, and Chip and Miles recruit other juniors at the school to execute it. They hire a male stripper, posing as a psychologist, to give a presentation at a Speaker’s Day event at their school. He delivers a speech about subverting the patriarchal paradigm and performs in front of the whole student body. 
Later in the year, Takumi points out to Chip and Miles that the date of Alaska’s death coincides with the date of the story Alaska shared with them about her mother’s death when they played a drinking game in the barn. The boys realize she must have forgotten the anniversary of her mother’s death and was driving to her grave to deliver flowers. Although they still feel guilty for helping her drive away drunk, and they do not know for sure whether it was an accident or suicide, they feel like they now have the closure they needed. 
“Straight and fast” was Alaska’s way out of the labyrinth of suffering, but Miles decides to choose the labyrinth over an escape. Miles feels more confident about seeking the Great Perhaps, despite the grief he experienced by loving and losing Alaska."
Interests,"In Outliers: The Story of Success, Malcolm Gladwell considers the circumstances that lead to success. The first half of the book looks closely at how opportunities matter more in the lives of successful people than hard work or raw talent. The second half of the book focuses on cultural legacies: behavioral tendencies rooted in their ancestral past.
Part One examines the role of opportunity in the lives of extremely successful people. Gladwell’s first example is the Canadian Hockey League, the world’s most competitive youth hockey league. Since the cutoff date for the Canadian leagues that serve the youngest players is January 1, those born in the first part of the calendar year are much larger and more coordinated than their peers. The larger and more coordinated kids are given more playing time and better coaching, and thus become better players by the time they reach the top league. An overwhelming majority of Canadian professional hockey players have birthdays in January, February or March.
Gladwell proposes that 10,000 hours of practice is needed to master a skill, even for prodigies like Mozart. Bill Joy, Bill Gates, and the Beatles all worked hard to achieve success but benefited from opportunities they did not create. Joy, one of the founders of Sun Microsystems, happened to attend one of the first colleges in the world with a time-sharing terminal. In graduate school, he had a terminal in his room, where he spent all of his free time programming. Gates happened to attend a private high school with a time-sharing terminal connected to a mainframe in Seattle. He also was able to spend all of his free time programming. Early on, the Beatles were hired to play long shows day after day in Hamburg, Germany. 
Birth year or era is another form of opportunity. Gates and Joy (as well as other early programmers) all reached the end of their teen years just as personal computers became available to the public. In another example, fourteen of the top seventy-five richest people in the history of the world happened to be alive at the same time, in the same country: the United States in the mid-1800s.
Opportunity matters more than an individual’s IQ. Using a study conducted by Lewis Terman, the creator of the Stanford-Binet IQ test, Gladwell shows that “practical intelligence” is as important as “analytical intelligence.” He also contrasts Chris Langan, one of the world’s smartest living people, with Robert Oppenheimer. While both had difficulties in college, only Oppenheimer had a successful life, due to his practical intelligence.
The last portion of Part One looks at Joe Flom, a successful lawyer from New York City. While he was born into a poor family to Jewish immigrants (in a time when Jewish immigrants were not treated well), many of the disadvantages in his life were actually benefits and directly contributed to his success.
Part Two investigates cultural legacies. Using flight recorder transcripts from several plane crashes from the last few decades, Gladwell shows that cultural expectations and habits can be a severe hindrance to pilots. Copilots from countries that have a high “Power Distance Index” (those that show the most deference to authority) will often avoid telling pilots that they are making mistakes, even when the mistakes are potentially fatal. After recognizing the dangers of such cultural expectations, commercial aviation has instituted programs to change the way flight crews talk with one another. 
Gladwell next analyzes the disparity in public school math test scores between Eastern and Western countries. He suggests that the cultures in which rice paddy farming is historically important have a stronger work ethic. Using various examples, Gladwell shows that hard work has a greater impact on success in learning mathematics than intelligence. 
The final example is an examination of the KIPP school in the South Bronx and the “achievement gap” between socioeconomic groups. American students from middle-class and affluent households retain more information over summer vacation and are more likely to make additional gains than students from low-income households. The KIPP school uses longer school days and summer programming to eliminate the achievement gap for low-income children. While the work schedule is very rigorous, the school’s students go on to great academic success.
Gladwell demonstrates that if more opportunities were available, there would be far more successful people and the world would be richer for it."
Weakest,"Gerda Weissmann Klein’s story begins on September 3, 1939, when she is fifteen. This day, she says, was the beginning of a tragedy that lasted six years. She is living in Bielitz, Poland, the town of her birth, and she reacts with horror as she watches her neighbors greet the invading Nazis with joy. The family had been trying to hide the possibility of war from Gerda’s father because he was ill and they didn’t want to upset him. Once their town is invaded, though, they can no longer keep it a secret from him. Sanctions start being imposed on the Jews, and Jewish men are being abducted by the Nazis.
In October, Gerda’s brother, Arthur, is forced to leave in a Nazi transport with all of the other young men in town. Gerda never sees him again, although she receives letters from him throughout much of the war. The situation becomes more and more dire for the Jews, as their Aryan neighbors take advantage of the situation as much as they can, buying their possessions for a fraction of their worth and taking over the factories they own. The Weissmanns are forced to switch homes with their laundress, who has been living in their basement, and not long after, they are told they will soon be forced to move into a Jewish ghetto. Gerda travels with her childhood friend Ilse to visit a camp for young Jewish men and meets Abek Feigenblatt, who quickly falls in love with her, although his feelings are not reciprocated. Gerda thinks of Abek is a friend and nothing more.
Gerda becomes increasingly aware of how truly horrifying the situation has gotten when she receives a letter from her friend Erika, telling her how her mother, baby brother, and boyfriend were forced to lie naked on the cobblestones of their town and were then trampled to death by Nazis on horseback.
In 1942, the family is forced into a Jewish ghetto and ordered to work for the German war effort. However, it is not long before all the Jews are told they will be moved out of town so Bielitz can be Judenrein—free of Jews. Gerda is separated from her parents and never sees them again.
Gerda goes to a transit camp in Sosnowitz, where Abek’s family makes sacrifices to try and get her freedom. However, she chooses to not go with them because she realizes that she will be so thoroughly in their debt that she will be forced to marry Abek, which she does not want to do. Gerda and Ilse are then transported to a labor camp that specializes in weaving, which they are forced to do for the German war effort. Gerda regularly receives loving letters from Abek while in the camp.
In August of 1943, the girls are divided into groups and told they will be leaving the camp and taken to Märzdorf, another labor camp. Luckily, Gerda and Ilse are in the same group. Märzdorf is almost unbearable for Gerda once she refuses a supervisor’s advances and is punished by being forced to work both the day and night shifts. Ilse manages to save her by having them both transferred to a weaving camp in Landeshut.
They discover that there is a men’s camp next door, reputed to be the worst camp in all of Germany. Gerda is shocked and guilt-ridden when she hears that Abek has voluntarily transferred there to be closer to her.
On May 6, 1944, the girls find out that they are to be transferred again. Ilse and Gerda continue to mourn the loss of their families but still have hope for their own survival. The new camp, Grünberg, is brutal, but still not as bad as Märzdorf. In November, the girls are forced to strip naked and be visually inspected by the SS (stands for Schutzstaffel, the term for Hitler’s elite group of soldiers). They hear rumors that they may be sent to provide “amusement” for wounded German soldiers. Gerda manages to buy enough poison for both herself and Ilse so that they will be able to avoid this fate.
As the war progresses and Germany begins to falter, the situation at the camp becomes worse and worse. In January 1945, they find out that Germany is being invaded by the Allies. Girls from other work camps arrive, increasing the camp population to over 4,000 young women. They are divided into two groups and told they will be marching to a concentration camp. Gerda says that her group was doomed—only 120 of them survived—but she expresses no regrets about being assigned to this group. They begin their march, and after only a few days, girls begin to die of starvation and cold. They march for weeks through bombed-out cities of Germany and, in March, finally arrive at another camp, Helmbrechts.
The next month, however, they are forced to begin marching again, and they soon cross the Czechoslovakian border. Ilse grows weaker and weaker, and Gerda tries in vain to protect her. Ilse dies on the march, as do most of the other prisoners. One night, in a town called Volary, they are locked into a factory building and left there by the SS with a bomb outside.
The bomb does not go off, however, and the Czech people unlock the doors, announcing that the war is over. The surviving girls are taken to a makeshift hospital by the Red Cross and American soldiers. One of these American soldiers is Kurt Klein, who continues to visit Gerda while she is in the hospital. Before he is forced to go back to America, he asks Gerda to come with him and be his wife. She says she knows she will never be alone again."
Carter,"Starr Carter, a sixteen-year-old black girl, attends a party in her neighborhood, Garden Heights. Starr goes with Kenya, a friend with whom she shares an older half-brother, Seven. Ever since attending Williamson Prep, a primarily white school, Starr feels out of place in the Garden Heights social scene. When Kenya goes off with other friends, Starr runs into her childhood best friend, Khalil Harris, whom she hasn’t seen in a long time. Gunshots from a gang fight interrupt the party, and Khalil offers to take Starr home. While Khalil drives, he explains rapper Tupac Shakur’s idea that “Thug Life” stands for “The Hate U Give Little Infants F---- Everybody.” Soon after, a white police officer with the badge number one-fifteen pulls them over. Khalil questions the motivation for the stop, and One-Fifteen orders him out of the car and searches him. One-Fifteen commands Khalil not to move, and returns to his car. Khalil opens the door to check on Starr. One-Fifteen fatally shoots Khalil.
Starr has nightmares about the death of another childhood friend, Natasha, who died in the crossfire of a gang shooting. At school on Monday, Starr feels tense around Hailey and Chris, her white friend and boyfriend, as memories of Khalil’s death interrupt her thoughts and she realizes they don’t understand. At the urging of her uncle Carlos, a police officer, Starr goes into the police station after school with her mother, Lisa, to testify about Khalil’s shooting. Starr realizes that the officers are asking more questions about whether Khalil was a troublemaker than about the night of the shooting. She worries that justice for Khalil will not be served. At Khalil’s funeral, a lawyer and activist named April Ofrah confirms Starr’s fears when she announces that the police will not pursue legal action against One-Fifteen and invites the attendees to a rally in Khalil’s honor. Starr blames herself for the police’s inaction. King, the head of a local gang called the King Lords, also interrupts the funeral and places a gray bandana on Khalil’s casket, signifying Khalil’s membership in the King Lords. April Ofrah tells Starr to call her if she needs legal representation.
The news that the police won’t prosecute One-Fifteen leads to days of protests in Garden Heights. During this time, Maverick, Starr’s father, explains to her his interpretation of Tupac’s phrase “Thug Life.” He believes that Thug Life describes a system designed against black communities. Only by speaking out can black communities begin to break the cycle. At the Carter family’s grocery store, a teenage member of the King Lords named DeVante begs Maverick, a former King Lord, to help him leave the gang. Maverick agrees. Starr sees DeVante’s request as a chance to help someone in a similar situation as Khalil. A few days later, Maverick gets into an argument with the neighborhood barber, Mr. Lewis. Although the argument is peaceful, two police officers intervene, and when they see Maverick is Starr’s father, they push him to the ground and search him. Between this scary event and pressure from Kenya, Starr decides that she will no longer be silent.
The District Attorney calls Lisa to announce that a grand jury will hear the case against One-Fifteen and asks if Starr will testify. Starr agrees, and April Ofrah decides to represent Starr pro bono, and also find a way to get Starr a television interview. Meanwhile, DeVante tells Starr that Khalil had never been a member of the King Lords and only sold drugs for King to protect his mother, who had stolen money from King. During Starr’s television interview, she decides, against Ms. Ofrah’s advice, to talk about the truth behind Khalil’s drug dealing. Starr’s implication of King enrages him. The night before her grand jury testimony, someone throws a brick and fires a gun into the Carter household. Unsure if the culprits are the King Lords or the police, Starr almost backs out of testifying. However, she ultimately decides that Khalil needs her truth. She testifies before the grand jury.
Almost two months later, the grand jury announces their decision not to indict One-Fifteen. Starr and some of her friends get caught up in the resulting riots. As she tries to avoid the chaos, Starr stumbles upon a protest led by Ms. Ofrah. She offers Starr the megaphone, and Starr leads a chant in front of the protest. The police try to break up the protest with tear gas. Starr and her friends head to the Carter family store to get milk to help heal their eyes. A Molotov cocktail lands in the store, setting it ablaze and trapping them. Maverick arrives just in time to unlock the back door. King arrives to taunt them, proud about getting his revenge. The police arrive, and King, confident that no one will testify against him, claims ignorance. However, the neighbors rally around the Carter family and tell the police that they saw King throw the Molotov cocktail. The police arrest King. Although the grocery store is in ruins, Starr knows that the family will rebuild. She vows to continue fighting for justice on behalf of Khalil and all other black people killed at the hands of police."
Exactly,"In “moon,” the first of the four parts of feed, an American teenager named Titus travels to the lunar surface with his high-school friends for spring break, hoping to escape the boredom they feel on Earth. No specific date is revealed, though it’s sometime in a dystopic future, where the moon is fully commercialized and people suffer from red sores called lesions. As Titus and his fellow upper-class friends Link, Marty, Calista, Loga, and Quendy arrive on the moon, readers also get their first glimpse of “the feed.” Although Titus doesn’t initially reveal exact details about the feed or how it works, he says it sends the friends ads and images for where to stay and shop. 
After failing to get into college-age parties, the group visits the Ricochet Lounge, where Titus becomes infatuated with a girl named Violet. She is beautiful and, he soon finds, visiting the moon by herself and is very unlike his friends: She doesn’t make pointless purchases at a mall they all soon visit and isn’t interested in malfunctioning, or falling into a drug-like stupor, via their connections to the feed. Later, when they all visit a dance club called the Rumble Spot, an old man from a dissenter group called the Coalition of Pity hacks into people’s individual feeds, causing them to broadcast the signal, “we enter a time of calamity” over the feed’s network. Police beat the man and “shut off” those hacked, including Titus and Violet, who hold hands as they collapse.
Part 2, “eden,” occurs in a lunar hospital where Violet, Titus, and his friends remain disconnected from the feed until their systems can be scanned for viruses. There, Titus provides additional details about what the feed is and how it works. Feeds are implanted inside the body and connect to a global network that provides news, entertainment, and a means to purchase every kind of product, he says while singing its praises. The feed even anticipates and creates users’ wants from individual profiles based on purchasing decisions, thoughts, and feelings. Titus and Violet grow closer during the stay. Violet, who’s home-schooled and smarter than Titus and his friends, says she hoped to enjoy herself like normal kids but now has a problem, though she remains vague about what this problem is. When doctors finally restore the friends’ feeds, they rejoice. Promotions begin to flow through their minds again, though there’s also ominous news concerning protests over America’s annexation of the moon and resulting anger from a group called the Global Alliance. Still, Titus says, the friends exalt in the return of their feeds.
In Part 3, “Utopia,” Titus and his friends return to Earth and life returns to normal for them: “upcars” travel in tubes past vertically stacked suburbs, the friends party, and U.S. President Trumbull scoffs at reports that claim toxic industries cause lesions. In defiance of rampant consumerism and a loss of individuality, Violet determines to resist the feed by creating a completely random customer profile and asks Titus to join her. Violet, who didn’t receive her feed until she was seven, voices deep concern about the decline of the world and destruction of Earth, and laments how those who’ve had the feed their entire lives are ignorant and self-centered. Titus soon has nightmares that are more likely hacks from the Coalition of Pity. In them, he sees disturbing images of eco destruction and human suffering around the world, but after Violet chats him, saying she has seen the images too, he only wants to go back to sleep.
Before long, Violet’s problem becomes clear: Her body begins to fail and she’s told by doctors that the damage to her feedware can be fatal. The prognosis makes Violet realize how much she wants to do. She starts by going to the seashore with Titus, though they need to dress in protective suits due to its toxicity. Meanwhile, feed chatter reveals that all of Earth’s forests have fallen and there is a growing rift between the U.S. and the Global Alliance. At a party where Quendy shows off her artificial lesions, Violet becomes outraged and her body falters. She chastises Titus and his friends for living in ignorance as the world dies, then collapses and is brought to the hospital. 
Violet’s condition declines further in Part 4, “slumberland,” whose chapter titles track her feed efficiency from a high of 87.3 percent to a low of 4.6 percent, 98 percent being optimal. Aware that she doesn’t have much time, Violet messages Titus a list of twenty-two things she wants to do in life, though he grows increasingly distant, and doesn’t message back. When they do reconnect, Violet sends Titus a recent memory where she falls down a staircase and receives a response from the corporation FeedTech, denying her petition to pay for her system repairs because she wasn’t deemed to be worthy due to her random customer profile. Violet later sends Titus childhood memories to preserve her history, though he deletes them. And when Violet convinces him to visit the mountains with her, one of her life goals, Titus breaks up with her, saying he was only interested in a short relationship while she wanted something eternal. 
Time passes and Titus eventually hears from Violet’s father. At Violet’s home, Titus sees her lying on a floating bed, completely pale, fully incapacitated, and covered in discs. Her father details her final, painful days and how her body failed. He then berates Titus for how badly he treated Violet and for willfully living in ignorance. Titus later visits Violet’s home a second time. Although she appears dead, her feed efficiency is at 4.6 percent and a screen shows that her heart is beating slightly. Nevertheless, Titus tells Violet a story he plans to keep telling her, he says, so she will remember herself. The story is about Violet, the end of America, and their relationship, where they learn something important about love and how to resist the feed. The book ends with a promotion on the feed for Blue-Jean Warehouse’s Final Sales Event and a recurring, fading message that “Everything must go.”"
Subjected,"Scout Finch lives with her brother, Jem, and their widowed father, Atticus, in the sleepy Alabama town of Maycomb. Maycomb is suffering through the Great Depression, but Atticus is a prominent lawyer and the Finch family is reasonably well off in comparison to the rest of society. One summer, Jem and Scout befriend a boy named Dill, who has come to live in their neighborhood for the summer, and the trio acts out stories together. Eventually, Dill becomes fascinated with the spooky house on their street called the Radley Place. The house is owned by Mr. Nathan Radley, whose brother, Arthur (nicknamed Boo), has lived there for years without venturing outside.
Scout goes to school for the first time that fall and detests it. She and Jem find gifts apparently left for them in a knothole of a tree on the Radley property. Dill returns the following summer, and he, Scout, and Jem begin to act out the story of Boo Radley. Atticus puts a stop to their antics, urging the children to try to see life from another person’s perspective before making judgments. But, on Dill’s last night in Maycomb for the summer, the three sneak onto the Radley property, where Nathan Radley shoots at them. Jem loses his pants in the ensuing escape. When he returns for them, he finds them mended and hung over the fence.
The next winter, Jem and Scout find more presents in the tree, presumably left by the mysterious Boo. Nathan Radley eventually plugs the knothole with cement. Shortly thereafter, a fire breaks out in another neighbor’s house, and during the fire someone slips a blanket on Scout’s shoulders as she watches the blaze. Convinced that Boo did it, Jem tells Atticus about the mended pants and the presents.
To the consternation of Maycomb’s racist white community, Atticus agrees to defend a Black man named Tom Robinson, who has been accused of raping a white woman. Because of Atticus’s decision, Jem and Scout are subjected to abuse from other children, even when they celebrate Christmas at the family compound on Finch’s Landing. Calpurnia, the Finches’ Black cook, takes them to the local Black church, where the warm and close-knit community largely embraces the children.
Atticus’s sister, Alexandra, comes to live with the Finches the next summer. Dill, who is supposed to live with his “new father” in another town, runs away and comes to Maycomb. Tom Robinson’s trial begins, and when the accused man is placed in the local jail, a mob gathers to lynch him. Atticus faces the mob down the night before the trial. Jem and Scout, who have sneaked out of the house, soon join him. Scout recognizes one of the men, and her polite questioning about his son shames him into dispersing the mob.
At the trial itself, the children sit in the “colored balcony” with the town’s Black citizens. Atticus provides clear evidence that the accusers, Mayella Ewell and her father, Bob, are lying: in fact, Mayella propositioned Tom Robinson, was caught by her father, and then accused Tom of rape to cover her shame and guilt. Atticus provides impressive evidence that the marks on Mayella’s face are from wounds that her father inflicted; upon discovering her with Tom, he called her a whore and beat her. Yet, despite the significant evidence pointing to Tom’s innocence, the all-white jury convicts him. The innocent Tom later tries to escape from prison and is shot to death. In the aftermath of the trial, Jem’s faith in justice is badly shaken, and he lapses into despondency and doubt.
Despite the verdict, Bob Ewell feels that Atticus and the judge have made a fool out of him, and he vows revenge. He menaces Tom Robinson’s widow, tries to break into the judge’s house, and finally attacks Jem and Scout as they walk home from a Halloween party. Boo Radley intervenes, however, saving the children and stabbing Ewell fatally during the struggle. Boo carries the wounded Jem back to Atticus’s house, where the sheriff, in order to protect Boo, insists that Ewell tripped over a tree root and fell on his own knife. After sitting with Scout for a while, Boo disappears once more into the Radley house.  
Later, Scout feels as though she can finally imagine what life is like for Boo. He has become a human being to her at last. With this realization, Scout embraces her father’s advice to practice sympathy and understanding and demonstrates that her experiences with hatred and prejudice will not sully her faith in human goodness."
Pledges,"The year is 1775, and social ills plague both France and England. Jerry Cruncher, an odd-job man who works for Tellson’s Bank, stops the Dover mail-coach with an urgent message for Jarvis Lorry. The message instructs Lorry to wait at Dover for a young woman, and Lorry responds with the cryptic words, “Recalled to Life.” At Dover, Lorry is met by Lucie Manette, a young orphan whose father, a once-eminent doctor whom she supposed dead, has been discovered in France. Lorry escorts Lucie to Paris, where they meet Defarge, a former servant of Doctor Manette, who has kept Manette safe in a garret. Driven mad by eighteen years in the Bastille, Manette spends all of his time making shoes, a hobby he learned while in prison. Lorry assures Lucie that her love and devotion can recall her father to life, and indeed they do.
The year is now 1780. Charles Darnay stands accused of treason against the English crown. A bombastic lawyer named Stryver pleads Darnay’s case, but it is not until his drunk, good-for-nothing colleague, Sydney Carton, assists him that the court acquits Darnay. Carton clinches his argument by pointing out that he himself bears an uncanny resemblance to the defendant, which undermines the prosecution’s case for unmistakably identifying Darnay as the spy the authorities spotted. Lucie and Doctor Manette watched the court proceedings, and that night, Carton escorts Darnay to a tavern and asks how it feels to receive the sympathy of a woman like Lucie. Carton despises and resents Darnay because he reminds him of all that he himself has given up and might have been.
In France, the cruel Marquis Evrémonde runs down a plebian child with his carriage. Manifesting an attitude typical of the aristocracy in regard to the poor at that time, the Marquis shows no regret, but instead curses the peasantry and hurries home to his chateau, where he awaits the arrival of his nephew, Darnay, from England. Arriving later that night, Darnay curses his uncle and the French aristocracy for its abominable treatment of the people. He renounces his identity as an Evrémonde and announces his intention to return to England. That night, the Marquis is murdered; the murderer has left a note signed with the nickname adopted by French revolutionaries: “Jacques.”
A year passes, and Darnay asks Manette for permission to marry Lucie. He says that, if Lucie accepts, he will reveal his true identity to Manette. Carton, meanwhile, also pledges his love to Lucie, admitting that, though his life is worthless, she has helped him dream of a better, more valuable existence. On the streets of London, Jerry Cruncher gets swept up in the funeral procession for a spy named Roger Cly. Later that night, he demonstrates his talents as a “Resurrection-Man,” sneaking into the cemetery to steal and sell Cly’s body. In Paris, meanwhile, another English spy known as John Barsad drops into Defarge’s wine shop. Barsad hopes to turn up evidence concerning the mounting revolution, which is still in its covert stages. Madame Defarge sits in the shop knitting a secret registry of those whom the revolution seeks to execute. Back in London, Darnay, on the morning of his wedding, keeps his promise to Manette; he reveals his true identity and, that night, Manette relapses into his old prison habit of making shoes. After nine days, Manette regains his presence of mind, and soon joins the newlyweds on their honeymoon. Upon Darnay’s return, Carton pays him a visit and asks for his friendship. Darnay assures Carton that he is always welcome in their home.
The year is now 1789. The peasants in Paris storm the Bastille and the French Revolution begins. The revolutionaries murder aristocrats in the streets, and Gabelle, a man charged with the maintenance of the Evrémonde estate, is imprisoned. Three years later, he writes to Darnay, asking to be rescued. Despite the threat of great danger to his person, Darnay departs immediately for France.
As soon as Darnay arrives in Paris, the French revolutionaries arrest him as an emigrant. Lucie and Manette make their way to Paris in hopes of saving him. Darnay remains in prison for a year and three months before receiving a trial. In order to help free him, Manette uses his considerable influence with the revolutionaries, who sympathize with him for having served time in the Bastille. Darnay receives an acquittal, but that same night he is arrested again. The charges, this time, come from Defarge and his vengeful wife. Carton arrives in Paris with a plan to rescue Darnay and obtains the help of John Barsad, who turns out to be Solomon Pross, the long-lost brother of Miss Pross, Lucie’s loyal servant.
At Darnay’s trial, Defarge produces a letter that he discovered in Manette’s old jail cell in the Bastille. The letter explains the cause of Manette’s imprisonment. Years ago, the brothers Evrémonde (Darnay’s father and uncle) enlisted Manette’s medical assistance. They asked him to tend to a woman, whom one of the brothers had raped, and her brother, whom the same brother had stabbed fatally. Fearing that Manette might report their misdeeds, the Evrémondes had him arrested. Upon hearing this story, the jury condemns Darnay for the crimes of his ancestors and sentences him to die within twenty-four hours. That night, at the Defarge’s wine shop, Carton overhears Madame Defarge plotting to have Lucie and her daughter (also Darnay’s daughter) executed as well; Madame Defarge, it turns out, is the surviving sibling of the man and woman killed by the Evrémondes. Carton arranges for the Manettes’ immediate departure from France. He then visits Darnay in prison, tricks him into changing clothes with him, and, after dictating a letter of explanation, drugs his friend unconscious. Barsad carries Darnay, now disguised as Carton, to an awaiting coach, while Carton, disguised as Darnay, awaits execution. As Darnay, Lucie, their child, and Dr. Manette speed away from Paris, Madame Defarge arrives at Lucie’s apartment, hoping to arrest her. There she finds the supremely protective Miss Pross. A scuffle ensues, and Madame Defarge dies by the bullet of her own gun. Sydney Carton meets his death at the guillotine, and the narrator confidently asserts that Carton dies with the knowledge that he has finally imbued his life with meaning."
Renewed,"Frederick Douglass was born into slavery sometime in 1817 or 1818. Like many enslaved people, he is unsure of his exact date of birth. Douglass is separated from his mother, Harriet Bailey, soon after he is born. His father is most likely their white master, Captain Anthony. Captain Anthony is the clerk of a rich man named Colonel Lloyd. Lloyd enslaves hundreds of men, women, and children, who call his large, central plantation the “Great House Farm.” Life on any of Lloyd’s plantations, like that on many Southern plantations, is brutal. Those enslaved are overworked and exhausted, receive little food, few articles of clothing, and no beds. Those who break rules—and even those who do not—are beaten or whipped, and sometimes even shot by the plantation overseers, the cruelest of which are Mr. Severe and Mr. Austin Gore. 
Douglass’s life on this plantation is not as hard as that of most of the others. Being a child, he serves in the household instead of in the fields. At the age of seven, he is given to Captain Anthony’s son‑in‑law’s brother, Hugh Auld, who lives in Baltimore. In Baltimore, Douglass enjoys a relatively freer life. In general, city slave-owners are more conscious of appearing cruel or neglectful toward those they enslave in front of their non‑slaveowning neighbors.
Sophia Auld, Hugh’s wife, has never ""owned"" enslaved people before, and therefore she is surprisingly kind to Douglass at first. She even begins to teach Douglass to read, until her husband orders her to stop, saying that education makes enslaved people unmanageable. Eventually, Sophia succumbs to the mentality of slaveowning and loses her natural kindliness. Though Sophia and Hugh Auld become crueler toward him, Douglass still likes Baltimore and is able to teach himself to read with the help of local boys. As he learns to read and write, Douglass becomes conscious of the evils of slavery and of the existence of the abolitionist, or antislavery, movement. He resolves to escape to the North eventually.
After the deaths of Captain Anthony and his remaining heirs, Douglass is taken back to serve Thomas Auld, Captain Anthony’s son‑in‑law. Auld is a mean man made harsher by his false religious piety. Auld considers Douglass unmanageable, so Auld rents him for one year to Edward Covey, a man known for “breaking” enslaved people. Covey manages, in the first six months, to work and whip all the spirit out of Douglass. Douglass becomes a brutish man, no longer interested in reading or freedom, capable only of resting from his injuries and exhaustion. The turning point comes when Douglass resolves to fight back against Covey. The two men have a two‑hour fight, after which Covey never touches Douglass again.
His year with Covey over, Douglass is next rented to William Freeland for two years. Though Freeland is a milder, fairer man, Douglass’s will to escape is nonetheless renewed. At Freeland’s, Douglass begins educating his fellow enslaved people in a Sabbath school at the homes of free Black people. Despite the threat of punishment and violence they face, many enslaved people from neighboring farms come to Douglass and work diligently to learn. At Freeland’s, Douglass also forms a plan of escape with three fellow enslaved men with whom he is close. Someone betrays their plan to Freeland, however, and Douglass and the others are taken to jail. Thomas Auld then sends Douglass back to Baltimore with Hugh Auld, to learn the trade of ship caulking.
In Baltimore’s trade industry, Douglass runs up against strained race relations. White workers have been working alongside free Black workers, but the whites have begun to fear that the increasing numbers of free Black people will take their jobs. Though only an apprentice and still enslaved, Douglass encounters violent tactics of intimidation from his white coworkers and is forced to switch shipyards. In his new apprenticeship, Douglass quickly learns the trade of caulking and soon earns the highest wages possible, always turning them over to Hugh Auld.
Eventually, Douglass receives permission from Hugh Auld to hire out his extra time. He saves money bit by bit and eventually makes his escape to New York. Douglass refrains from describing the details of his escape in order to protect the safety of future slaves who may attempt the journey. In New York, Douglass fears recapture and changes his name from Bailey to Douglass. Soon after, he marries Anna Murray, a free woman he met while in Baltimore. They move north to Massachusetts, where Douglass becomes deeply engaged with the abolitionist movement as both a writer and an orator."
Shelter,"Brian Robeson, a thirteen-year-old from New York City, boards a plan headed from Hampton, New York to the Canadian north woods to visit his father. His parents' recent divorce weighs heavily on him, as does ""The Secret"" that his mother is having an affair. The pilot gives him a very brief flying lesson in which Brian has control of the plane for a few minutes. The pilot seems to be experiencing increasing pain in his shoulder, arm, and stomach. At first Brian does not think it is very serious, but as the pilot begins jerking in his seat it becomes clear that he is having a heart attack. The attack stops and the pilot is dead; Brian is forced to take over the controls. After a harrowing descent, the plane crashes into a lake in the Canadian woods, where Brian is stranded.
Brian has little to eat and is injured from the crash, but believes he will soon be rescued. He finds some strange berries to eat, which make him extremely sick. He then finds a raspberry patch, where he spots a bear. Brian constructs a shelter and in the middle of the night he hears a noise. A porcupine has entered his shelter and Brian throws the hatchet in its direction. It shoots its quills into Brian's leg, causing him severe pain. Brian attempts to build a fire with no matches and eventually succeeds when he learns how to strike his hatchet against a stone to ignite sparks. He finds turtle eggs and eagerly eats them. One day a plane flies overhead but does not see him and continues on its way, leaving Brian devastated and hopeless. He attempts to commit suicide by cutting himself with his hatchet, but survives the attempt and emerges from the experience determined to embrace life and to take an active role in his own fate.
Brian soon catches his first fish and enjoys a big feast. That night, however, a skunk enters the shelter and when Brian yells at the skunk, it sprays him, temporarily blinding him and covering him with a horrible stench. Brian perfects his tools and catches a foolbird, his first meat. While he is cleaning the bird in the water, a moose attacks Brian, injuring his ribs and his shoulder. Another unfortunate incident soon follows when a tornado sweeps over the woods and destroys Brian's shelter.
The day after the tornado, Brian discovers that the chaotic storm has riled up the water in the lake, and the tail of the plane had emerged from the lake, reminding Brian of the dead pilot and compelling him to say a few words for him. Lying in bed one night, it occurs to Brian that he could seek out the survival pack in the body of the plane, and he determines to build a raft to do so. After many incidents of trial-and-error, Brian retrieves the survival pack from the plane. At one point he drops the hatchet to the lake's bottom, but retrieves it with a long dive. On his way back up to the surface, Brian sees the dead pilot's head underwater, partially eaten by fish. Brian gets sick in the water but manages to make it back to his shelter to get some sleep.
The next morning Brian opens the survival pack, which contains countless useful items, some of which Brian rejects in favor of the self-sufficient methods he has developed during his time in the woods. However, there is freeze-dried food that he decides to cook immediately. He also finds something labeled ""Emergency Transmitter."" He fiddles with it but it appears not to function. As Brian is preparing his much-anticipated meal, a plane lands on the lake to rescue a dumbfounded Brian sitting down to eat his freeze-dried meal."
Launched,"A youth named Equality 7-2521, who has found a hidden tunnel and hides in it to write, knows his solitude violates all the laws of his society. Even though he does not feel guilt for his actions, he begs the forgiveness of the ruling Council. As he spends more time alone, he realizes that solitude suits him, and he begins to crave more and more time by himself. From his tunnel, Equality 7-2521 records episodes from his childhood. As a child, Equality 7-2521 wanted more than anything to be a scholar. He believed he was cursed with a terrific curiosity, which made him prefer some things to others and to prefer some people to others. He often fought with the boys at the Home of Students, and he was reprimanded by his teachers for being too smart and too tall. He tried to conform to the standard the others set, but no matter how hard he tried, he was smarter and quicker than they were. When the Council of Vocations assigned him to be a street sweeper instead of a scholar, he was pleased because it meant he could atone for the sins he had committed.
When he was ten, Equality 7-2521 saw the public execution of the Transgressor of the Unspeakable Word, who had discovered the word “I” and was burned to death in the town square as punishment for using the word. While he was burning, the Transgressor showed no pain but locked eyes with Equality 7-2521. Equality 7-2521 comes to believe that that moment anointed him as a disciple of the same crusade as the Transgressor.
Equality 7-2521 begins to conduct experiments and shortly discovers electricity. After many weeks of work, he successfully builds a lightbulb from the materials he finds in his tunnel. He decides that he must share his invention with the world and resolves to present it to the World Council of Scholars when it convenes that year in his city.
In the meantime, Equality 7-2521 has met the Golden One, a beautiful peasant girl who is proud and haughty. He knows it is wrong to do so, but he speaks to her when he gets the chance, and they immediately fall in love. One day, she offers him some water from her hands, and he drinks it, not understanding why this act makes him think of the Palace of Mating, where he and all other mature citizens are sent once a year to have sex.
Before he can show the lightbulb to the World Council, Equality 7-2521 accidentally returns late to the Home of the Street Sweepers, where he lives. When he refuses to tell his Home Council where he has been, he is thrown into the Palace of Corrective Detention. There he is tortured, but he still refuses to tell where he has been, because he wants to keep the lightbulb a secret until he gets to show it to the World Council. He remains incarcerated until the World Council convenes, when he breaks out of the Palace of Corrective Detention and goes to the World Council, expecting to be exonerated and reconciled with his brothers.
When Equality 7-2521 arrives and tells the World Council his story, however, the World Council rejects him out of fear and anger. It threatens to kill him and to get rid of his lightbulb. He cannot abide having his lightbulb destroyed, so he grabs his invention and flees the city. He runs to the Uncharted Forest where he discovers that he is free at last to do as he pleases.
A few days later, the Golden One appears. She has followed Equality 7-2521 into the woods. They vow to live together in peace and solitude. After they have been hiking for several days in the mountains, they find an abandoned house from the Unmentionable Times. The Golden One revels in the finery she finds in the house, and Equality 7-2521 consumes the library. He discovers the meaning of the word “I,” and he vows to protect his home and from there launch a new race of men who will believe in individualism and the never-ending supremacy of the ego."
Almighty,"Max, who narrates this story in the first person, tells the reader that before he met Freak, he didn’t have a brain. This, he says, is “the unvanquished truth.”
Max first meets Freak, or Kevin, at daycare, the year that Max moves in with Grim and Gram, his mother’s parents. Freak uses crutches and calls himself “Robot Man.” One day, Freak leaves daycare and doesn’t return.
Max resumes the story in the summer before eighth grade. Grim, Max’s grandfather, worries that Max is beginning to look like Him, Max’s father. Max tells us he is L.D., learning disabled, and he doesn’t think he has much going on in his brain. One day, Max is in the backyard. He recognizes a woman moving items into a house down the block as Freak’s mom, and then sees Freak himself. Max is curious and he approaches the house. Freak asks the “earthling” (Max) to identify himself. Max runs back to his basement. He emerges later to find Freak trying to retrieve an object stuck high in a tree. Max helps him and they spend the afternoon together. Freak’s mom, who Max knows as “Fair Gwen of Air”, invites Max to dinner. Max learns that Gwen and his mom were friends years ago. 
Max and Freak go the Fourth of July fireworks show by the millpond together. Max hoists Freak onto his shoulders so that Freak can see. When the show ends, Tony D. (known as Blade) and his gang corner Max and Freak. With Freak steering Max by kicking him right or left, they run straight into the millpond, where Max becomes stuck in the mud. Blade and his followers throw rocks at them from the shore. The police arrive and rescue Max and Freak. One of the cops seems to recognize Max as the son of someone he calls “Killer Kane,” and asks if his dad is still in prison. Freak interrupts him and says, “We’re Freak the Mighty, that’s who we are.” 
Freak the Mighty spend the summer going on quests. On these quests, Freak uses words Max doesn’t understand and insists that Max look them up in the dictionary Freak always carries. Max pretends to understand.
One day, Max and Freak walk to the “Medical Research” facility where Freak says they have an Experimental Bionics Unit. Freak tells Max that he visits there every few months to be fitted for a bionic transplant. Max thinks such a procedure will be painful and dangerous, but Freak says that pain is a state of mind and life itself is dangerous.
The two boys embark on a nighttime quest to retrieve a purse that Blade and his gang tossed down a storm drain. The purse is empty except for an ID card with the address of a Loretta Lee on it. The next day, Max and Freak walk to an area of rundown apartment buildings called the Testaments. Loretta and a man named Iggy live at the address, and they both know Max’s father, Kenny Kane. Iggy says that Max is a “ringer” for his dad, Killer Kane. Loretta remembers that Freak is Gwen’s son. Iggy kicks the boys out and they run home.
The school year begins, and Max finds himself in the same class as Freak. Classmates yell slurs at him. Suddenly, Freak climbs onto Max’s shoulders and directs Max to walk around the room. “Freak the Mighty, Freak the Mighty!” he shouts. Soon the whole class is chanting. Freak the Mighty end up in the principal’s office. 
Friday the thirteenth in October comes and it’s a bad one. First, Max’s dad wants Max to write a letter to the parole board on his behalf. Max has a panic attack. Second, a medical emergency sends Freak to the hospital. His insides are growing but his outside isn’t.
As Christmas approaches, Grim tells Max that his dad is out on parole. Freak and Fair Gwen, Max, Grim and Gram spend Christmas Eve together. Freak gives Max a dictionary that he has written, filled with his favorite words. The best gift ever, Max thinks.
After the Christmas Eve festivities, Max’s father sneaks into the basement. He kidnaps Max, and they end up at Loretta and Iggy’s place. Kenny ties up Max in a vacant apartment and swears on a Bible that he did not murder Max’s mother. 
Iggy reports that Freak has sent the cops to look for them. Kenny escapes with Max to an abandoned building where he gags and ties Max up. When Kenny leaves, Loretta appears and works to free Max. No sooner is Max untied, than Kenny returns, and grabs Loretta to choke her. Max tries to stop him, yelling that he saw Kenny kill his mother. Kane lets go of Loretta and grabs Max’s neck. Seconds later, Freak appears with a squirt gun supposedly filled with sulfuric acid, which he sprays at Kenny’s eyes. Max and Freak escape, the cops arrest Kenny and save Loretta. Freak laughs because the squirt gun – filled in fact with soap, vinegar, and curry powder – worked. As Gwen arrives and carries Freak away, he yells, “Freak the Mighty strikes again!” 
The school year continues. Gwen warns Kevin that he has to be “extra careful.” He’s been having trouble breathing. Max awaits his father’s trial and is relieved when Killer Kane pleads guilty because he won’t have to testify. 
Freak, Fair Gwen, Grim, Gram, and Max celebrate Freak’s thirteenth birthday. Suddenly, Freak has a seizure and is rushed to the hospital. 
The doctors make an exception and allow Max to visit when Freak asks for him. Freak tells Max that he won’t be coming home looking the way he looks now, and that he’s having a special operation. He gives Max a gift of a blank book and tells Max to write in it, to tell the story of Freak the Mighty.
When Max arrives back at the hospital the next day, Freak has passed away. The doctor explains that his heart just got too big for his body. 
For a long time, Max does not come out of the basement. When he eventually does, he runs into Loretta Lee, who asks what he’s been doing. When he says, “Nothing,” Loretta tells him, “Nothing is a drag, kid. Think about it.” That night, Max takes out the blank book and starts writing “the unvanquished truth.” He finishes the story and feels good about having written a book. Max thinks maybe he’ll even read a book now."
Conceiving,"Michelle Obama grows up in a two-story bungalow on Chicago’s South Side. Her parents, Fraser and Marian Robinson, rent an upstairs apartment from Marian’s aunt and uncle, who live downstairs. Michelle’s father has multiple sclerosis, but he does not let his disability limit him. He works at a water filtration plant and is also a local precinct captain for the Democratic party. Michelle is a smart, determined girl with little tolerance for disorder. She is less sociable than her older brother, Craig, a gifted basketball player who has many friends. Over time, however, Michelle learns to be more outgoing.
Michelle’s parents believe in education. Her mother does volunteer work on behalf of their neighborhood school, which struggles to maintain quality as the neighborhood declines. Fraser and Marian send Craig to a predominantly white Catholic school with a strong basketball program and a rigorous curriculum. When Michelle is ready for high school, she gains admission to Whitney Young, a new magnet school for gifted students. At Whitney Young, her friendship with a daughter of civil rights leader the Reverend Jesse Jackson gives Michelle a chance to observe what life is like for people active in politics.
Michelle follows her brother to Princeton, where she does well. One of her closest friends at Princeton is a Jamaican student named Suzanne; that friendship helps Michelle see that not everyone has to be as organized and driven as she is. Michelle graduates, studies law at Harvard, and goes to work at a high-end law firm in Chicago. By then, however, she realizes that she hates being a lawyer. Her life takes a turn when she is asked to help mentor a male summer associate named Barack Obama. The son of a Black Kenyan father and a white American mother, he is older than Michelle but started law school later, after some years doing other things, including community organizing in Chicago. Barack’s brilliance is quickly apparent to everyone at the firm, and he and Michelle are immediately attracted to each other.
As Michelle and Barack get acquainted, she sees that he has a higher tolerance for turmoil and uncertainty than she does. She also sees his dedication to making the world a better place. However, Michelle faces crushing loss: her friend Suzanne dies of cancer, and her father dies from MS after decades of fighting to live a normal life. Realizing that life is short, Michelle looks for opportunities to transition out of her legal career. Some personal connections lead to a job at city hall, working for Valerie Jarrett, who will become a lifelong friend and ally. Barack, meanwhile, works in the Chicago area for a national get-out-the vote organization. By now, he and Michelle are engaged. They marry in 1992.
Barack is working for a public interest law firm when the opportunity arises for him to run for a seat in the Illinois state senate. By now, Michelle has run a nonprofit organization and is serving as a university dean. Michelle does not like politics and predicts that Barack will not like it, either; but after he wins his race, he turns out to have the right kind of temperament and skills to be a politician. Then Barack loses his mother to cancer, and Michelle suffers a miscarriage. After failed attempts to conceive again, the Obamas turn to in vitro fertilization (IVF) and their first daughter, Malia, is born Michelle becomes director of community outreach at a hospital. 
After a failed campaign for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, daughter Sasha is born. Their burgeoning family and careers but strains on Michelle and Barack, but couples therapy helps them make some useful adjustments. Barack runs for the U.S. Senate and unexpectedly builds a commanding lead even before his speech at the Democratic National Convention boosts his national profile. He wins the Senate race easily.
When Barack moves to Washington, Michelle and the girls stay in Chicago. To her consternation, Barack and a team of advisers are already discussing a 2008 presidential run. She agrees to be part of the campaign but privately thinks that as a Black man, Barack cannot win. During the campaign, there are absurd rumors, circulated by his opponents, about Barack having Muslim ties. Michelle is an asset on the campaign trail, although she is discouraged when a video of one of her speeches is edited down to suggests that she carries a grudge against America. After the August convention, where Michelle gives a well-received speech, Barack and his running mate, Joe Biden, achieve a decisive win. Michelle believes that Barack is the right person to lead the country out of the ongoing economic recession.
The transition between the Bush and Obama administrations is smooth and welcoming. The White House staff is kind and efficient. Michelle and Barack learn to get used to being accompanied by Secret Service agents whenever they go out, but they do their best to keep the girls’ lives as normal as possible. Michelle’s mother, whom Barack and Michelle persuaded to move in with them, declines Secret Service protection altogether.
As First Lady, Michelle must be engaged and productive without overstepping her bounds. Her early work focuses on childhood obesity, through the Let’s Move! initiative to promote exercise and healthy eating. Michelle plants a vegetable garden on the South Lawn. She also promotes post-high school education through her Reach Higher initiative, and education for girls around the world through the Let Girls Learn initiative. Finally, she teams up with the Second Lady, Jill Biden, to improve support for military families through the Joining Forces initiative. 
During Barack’s successful reelection campaign in 2012, Michelle discovers the power of social media. Like the rest of the country, the Obamas are shocked by mass shootings at Sandy Hook School in Newtown, Connecticut and at a Black church in Charleston. The death of a Chicago girl in a drive-by shooting has personal meaning for Michelle: the girl lived not far from Michelle’s old neighborhood and had recently participated in the second inaugural celebration. 
During the 2016 presidential contest, Michelle is appalled by Donald Trump’s past and present behavior and is shocked when he achieves a come-from-behind win over Hillary Clinton. She takes comfort in all the things she and Barack have accomplished over the last eight years and reminds herself that there is much to be optimistic about."
Gets,"Jack Worthing, the play’s protagonist, is a pillar of the community in Hertfordshire, where he is guardian to Cecily Cardew, the pretty, eighteen-year-old granddaughter of the late Thomas Cardew, who found and adopted Jack when he was a baby. In Hertfordshire, Jack has responsibilities: he is a major landowner and justice of the peace, with tenants, farmers, and a number of servants and other employees all dependent on him. For years, he has also pretended to have an irresponsible black-sheep brother named Ernest who leads a scandalous life in pursuit of pleasure and is always getting into trouble of a sort that requires Jack to rush grimly off to his assistance. In fact, Ernest is merely Jack’s alibi, a phantom that allows him to disappear for days at a time and do as he likes. No one but Jack knows that he himself is Ernest. Ernest is the name Jack goes by in London, which is where he really goes on these occasions—probably to pursue the very sort of behavior he pretends to disapprove of in his imaginary brother.
Jack is in love with Gwendolen Fairfax, the cousin of his best friend, Algernon Moncrieff. When the play opens, Algernon, who knows Jack as Ernest, has begun to suspect something, having found an inscription inside Jack’s cigarette case addressed to “Uncle Jack” from someone who refers to herself as “little Cecily.” Algernon suspects that Jack may be leading a double life, a practice he seems to regard as commonplace and indispensable to modern life. He calls a person who leads a double life a “Bunburyist,” after a nonexistent friend he pretends to have, a chronic invalid named Bunbury, to whose deathbed he is forever being summoned whenever he wants to get out of some tiresome social obligation.
At the beginning of Act 1, Jack drops in unexpectedly on Algernon and announces that he intends to propose to Gwendolen. Algernon confronts him with the cigarette case and forces him to come clean, demanding to know who “Jack” and “Cecily” are. Jack confesses that his name isn’t really Ernest and that Cecily is his ward, a responsibility imposed on him by his adoptive father’s will. Jack also tells Algernon about his fictional brother. Jack says he’s been thinking of killing off this fake brother, since Cecily has been showing too active an interest in him. Without meaning to, Jack describes Cecily in terms that catch Algernon’s attention and make him even more interested in her than he is already.
Gwendolen and her mother, Lady Bracknell, arrive, which gives Jack an opportunity to propose to Gwendolen. Jack is delighted to discover that Gwendolen returns his affections, but he is alarmed to learn that Gwendolen is fixated on the name Ernest, which she says “inspires absolute confidence.” Gwendolen makes clear that she would not consider marrying a man who was not named Ernest.
Lady Bracknell interviews Jack to determine his eligibility as a possible son-in-law, and during this interview she asks about his family background. When Jack explains that he has no idea who his parents were and that he was found, by the man who adopted him, in a handbag in the cloakroom at Victoria Station, Lady Bracknell is scandalized. She forbids the match between Jack and Gwendolen and sweeps out of the house.
In Act 2, Algernon shows up at Jack’s country estate posing as Jack’s brother Ernest. Meanwhile, Jack, having decided that Ernest has outlived his usefulness, arrives home in deep mourning, full of a story about Ernest having died suddenly in Paris. He is enraged to find Algernon there masquerading as Ernest but has to go along with the charade. If he doesn’t, his own lies and deceptions will be revealed.
While Jack changes out of his mourning clothes, Algernon, who has fallen hopelessly in love with Cecily, asks her to marry him. He is surprised to discover that Cecily already considers that they are engaged, and he is charmed when she reveals that her fascination with “Uncle Jack’s brother” led her to invent an elaborate romance between herself and him several months ago. Algernon is less enchanted to learn that part of Cecily’s interest in him derives from the name Ernest, which, unconsciously echoing Gwendolen, she says “inspires absolute confidence.”
Algernon goes off in search of Dr. Chasuble, the local rector, to see about getting himself christened Ernest. Meanwhile, Gwendolen arrives, having decided to pay Jack an unexpected visit. Gwendolen is shown into the garden, where Cecily orders tea and attempts to play hostess. Cecily has no idea how Gwendolen figures into Jack’s life, and Gwendolen, for her part, has no idea who Cecily is. Gwendolen initially thinks Cecily is a visitor to the Manor House and is disconcerted to learn that Cecily is “Mr. Worthing’s ward.” She notes that Ernest has never mentioned having a ward, and Cecily explains that it is not Ernest Worthing who is her guardian but his brother Jack and, in fact, that she is engaged to be married to Ernest Worthing. Gwendolen points out that this is impossible as she herself is engaged to Ernest Worthing. The tea party degenerates into a war of manners.
Jack and Algernon arrive toward the climax of this confrontation, each having separately made arrangements with Dr. Chasuble to be christened Ernest later that day. Each of the young ladies points out that the other has been deceived: Cecily informs Gwendolen that her fiancé is really named Jack and Gwendolen informs Cecily that hers is really called Algernon. The two women demand to know where Jack’s brother Ernest is, since both of them are engaged to be married to him. Jack is forced to admit that he has no brother and that Ernest is a complete fiction. Both women are shocked and furious, and they retire to the house arm in arm.
Act 3 takes place in the drawing room of the Manor House, where Cecily and Gwendolen have retired. When Jack and Algernon enter from the garden, the two women confront them. Cecily asks Algernon why he pretended to be her guardian’s brother. Algernon tells her he did it in order to meet her. Gwendolen asks Jack whether he pretended to have a brother in order to come into London to see her as often as possible, and she interprets his evasive reply as an affirmation. The women are somewhat appeased but still concerned over the issue of the name. However, when Jack and Algernon tell Gwendolen and Cecily that they have both made arrangements to be christened Ernest that afternoon, all is forgiven and the two pairs of lovers embrace. At this moment, Lady Bracknell’s arrival is announced.
Lady Bracknell has followed Gwendolen from London, having bribed Gwendolen’s maid to reveal her destination. She demands to know what is going on. Gwendolen again informs Lady Bracknell of her engagement to Jack, and Lady Bracknell reiterates that a union between them is out of the question. Algernon tells Lady Bracknell of his engagement to Cecily, prompting her to inspect Cecily and inquire into her social connections, which she does in a routine and patronizing manner that infuriates Jack. He replies to all her questions with a mixture of civility and sarcasm, withholding until the last possible moment the information that Cecily is actually worth a great deal of money and stands to inherit still more when she comes of age. At this, Lady Bracknell becomes genuinely interested.
Jack informs Lady Bracknell that, as Cecily’s legal guardian, he refuses to give his consent to her union with Algernon. Lady Bracknell suggests that the two young people simply wait until Cecily comes of age, and Jack points out that under the terms of her grandfather’s will, Cecily does not legally come of age until she is thirty-five. Lady Bracknell asks Jack to reconsider, and he points out that the matter is entirely in her own hands. As soon as she consents to his marriage to Gwendolen, Cecily can have his consent to marry Algernon. However, Lady Bracknell refuses to entertain the notion. She and Gwendolen are on the point of leaving when Dr. Chasuble arrives and happens to mention Cecily’s governess, Miss Prism. At this, Lady Bracknell starts and asks that Miss Prism be sent for.
When the governess arrives and catches sight of Lady Bracknell, she begins to look guilty and furtive. Lady Bracknell accuses her of having left her sister’s house twenty-eight years before with a baby and never returned. She demands to know where the baby is. Miss Prism confesses she doesn’t know, explaining that she lost the baby, having absentmindedly placed it in a handbag in which she had meant to place the manuscript for a novel she had written. Jack asks what happened to the bag, and Miss Prism says she left it in the cloakroom of a railway station. Jack presses her for further details and goes racing offstage, returning a few moments later with a large handbag. When Miss Prism confirms that the bag is hers, Jack throws himself on her with a cry of “Mother!” It takes a while before the situation is sorted out, but before too long we understand that Jack is not the illegitimate child of Miss Prism but the legitimate child of Lady Bracknell’s sister and, therefore, Algernon’s older brother. Furthermore, Jack had been originally christened “Ernest John.” All these years Jack has unwittingly been telling the truth: Ernest is his name, as is Jack, and he does have an unprincipled younger brother—Algernon. Again the couples embrace, Miss Prism and Dr. Chasuble follow suit, and Jack acknowledges that he now understands “the vital Importance of Being Earnest.”"
Man,"The narrator begins telling his story with the claim that he is an “invisible man.” His invisibility, he says, is not a physical condition—he is not literally invisible—but is rather the result of the refusal of others to see him. He says that because of his invisibility, he has been hiding from the world, living underground and stealing electricity from the Monopolated Light & Power Company. He burns 1,369 light bulbs simultaneously and listens to Louis Armstrong’s “(What Did I Do to Be So) Black and Blue” on a phonograph. He says that he has gone underground in order to write the story of his life and invisibility.
As a young man, in the late 1920s or early 1930s, the narrator lived in the South. Because he is a gifted public speaker, he is invited to give a speech to a group of important white men in his town. The men reward him with a briefcase containing a scholarship to a prestigious Black college, but only after humiliating him by forcing him to fight in a “battle royal” in which he is pitted against other young Black men, all blindfolded, in a boxing ring. After the battle royal, the white men force the youths to scramble over an electrified rug in order to snatch at fake gold coins. The narrator has a dream that night in which he imagines that his scholarship is actually a piece of paper with a crude command to keep him running.
Three years later, the narrator is a student at the college. He is asked to drive a wealthy white trustee of the college, Mr. Norton, around the campus. Norton talks incessantly about his daughter, then shows an undue interest in the narrative of Jim Trueblood, a poor, uneducated Black man who impregnated his own daughter. After hearing this story, Norton needs a drink, and the narrator takes him to the Golden Day, a saloon and brothel that normally serves Black men. A fight breaks out among a group of Black veterans at the bar, and Norton passes out during the chaos. He is tended by one of the veterans, who claims to be a doctor and who taunts both Norton and the narrator for their blindness regarding race relations.
Back at the college, the narrator listens to a long, impassioned sermon by the Reverend Homer A. Barbee on the subject of the college’s Founder, whom the blind Barbee glorifies with poetic language. After the sermon, the narrator is chastised by the college president, Dr. Bledsoe, who has learned of the narrator’s misadventures with Norton at the old slave quarters and the Golden Day. Bledsoe rebukes the narrator, saying that he should have shown the white man an idealized version of Black life. He expels the narrator, giving him seven letters of recommendation addressed to the college’s white trustees in New York City, and sends him there in search of a job.
The narrator travels to the bright lights and bustle of 1930s Harlem, where he looks unsuccessfully for work. The letters of recommendation are of no help. At last, the narrator goes to the office of one of his letters’ addressees, a trustee named Mr. Emerson. There he meets Emerson’s son, who opens the letter and tells the narrator that he has been betrayed: the letters from Bledsoe actually portray the narrator as dishonorable and unreliable. The young Emerson helps the narrator to get a low-paying job at the Liberty Paints plant, whose trademark color is “Optic White.” The narrator briefly serves as an assistant to Lucius Brockway, the Black man who makes this white paint, but Brockway suspects him of joining in union activities and turns on him. The two men fight, neglecting the paint-making; consequently, one of the unattended tanks explodes, and the narrator is knocked unconscious.
The narrator wakes in the paint factory’s hospital, having temporarily lost his memory and ability to speak. The white doctors seize the arrival of their unidentified black patient as an opportunity to conduct electric shock experiments. After the narrator recovers his memory and leaves the hospital, he collapses on the street. Some black community members take him to the home of Mary, a kind woman who lets him live with her for free in Harlem and nurtures his sense of Black heritage. One day, the narrator witnesses the eviction of an elderly Black couple from their Harlem apartment. Standing before the crowd of people gathered before the apartment, he gives an impassioned speech against the eviction. Brother Jack overhears his speech and offers him a position as a spokesman for the Brotherhood, a political organization that allegedly works to help the socially oppressed. After initially rejecting the offer, the narrator takes the job in order to pay Mary back for her hospitality. But the Brotherhood demands that the narrator take a new name, break with his past, and move to a new apartment. The narrator is inducted into the Brotherhood at a party at the Chthonian Hotel and is placed in charge of advancing the group’s goals in Harlem.
After being trained in rhetoric by a white member of the group named Brother Hambro, the narrator goes to his assigned branch in Harlem, where he meets the handsome, intelligent black youth leader Tod Clifton. He also becomes familiar with the Black nationalist leader Ras the Exhorter, who opposes the interracial Brotherhood and believes that Black Americans should fight for their rights over and against all whites. The narrator delivers speeches and becomes a high-profile figure in the Brotherhood, and he enjoys his work. One day, however, he receives an anonymous note warning him to remember his place as a Black man in the Brotherhood. Not long after, the Black Brotherhood member Brother Wrestrum accuses the narrator of trying to use the Brotherhood to advance a selfish desire for personal distinction. While a committee of the Brotherhood investigates the charges, the organization moves the narrator to another post, as an advocate of women’s rights. After giving a speech one evening, he is seduced by one of the white women at the gathering, who attempts to use him to play out her sexual fantasies about Black men.
After a short time, the Brotherhood sends the narrator back to Harlem, where he discovers that Clifton has disappeared. Many other Black members have left the group, as much of the Harlem community feels that the Brotherhood has betrayed their interests. The narrator finds Clifton on the street selling dancing “Sambo” dolls—dolls that invoke the stereotype of the lazy and obsequious slave. Clifton apparently does not have a permit to sell his wares on the street. White policemen accost him and, after a scuffle, shoot him dead as the narrator and others look on. On his own initiative, the narrator holds a funeral for Clifton and gives a speech in which he portrays his dead friend as a hero, galvanizing public sentiment in Clifton’s favor. The Brotherhood is furious with him for staging the funeral without permission, and Jack harshly castigates him. As Jack rants about the Brotherhood’s ideological stance, a glass eye falls from one of his eye sockets. The Brotherhood sends the narrator back to Brother Hambro to learn about the organization’s new strategies in Harlem.
The narrator leaves feeling furious and anxious to gain revenge on Jack and the Brotherhood. He arrives in Harlem to find the neighborhood in ever-increased agitation over race relations. Ras confronts him, deploring the Brotherhood’s failure to draw on the momentum generated by Clifton’s funeral. Ras sends his men to beat up the narrator, and the narrator is forced to disguise himself in dark glasses and a hat. In his dark glasses, many people on the streets mistake him for someone named Rinehart, who seems to be a pimp, bookie, lover, and reverend all at once. At last, the narrator goes to Brother Hambro’s apartment, where Hambro tells him that the Brotherhood has chosen not to emphasize Harlem and the Black movement. He cynically declares that people are merely tools and that the larger interests of the Brotherhood are more important than any individual. Recalling advice given to him by his grandfather, the narrator determines to undermine the Brotherhood by seeming to go along with them completely. He decides to flatter and seduce a woman close to one of the party leaders in order to obtain secret information about the group.
But the woman he chooses, Sybil, knows nothing about the Brotherhood and attempts to use the narrator to fulfill her fantasy of being raped by a Black man. While still with Sybil in his apartment, the narrator receives a call asking him to come to Harlem quickly. The narrator hears the sound of breaking glass, and the line goes dead. He arrives in Harlem to find the neighborhood in the midst of a full-fledged riot, which he learns was incited by Ras. The narrator becomes involved in setting fire to a tenement building. Running from the scene of the crime, he encounters Ras, dressed as an African chieftain. Ras calls for the narrator to be lynched. The narrator flees, only to encounter two policemen, who suspect that his briefcase contains loot from the riots. In his attempt to evade them, the narrator falls down a manhole. The police mock him and draw the cover over the manhole.
The narrator says that he has stayed underground ever since; the end of his story is also the beginning. He states that he finally has realized that he must honor his individual complexity and remain true to his own identity without sacrificing his responsibility to the community. He says that he finally feels ready to emerge from underground."
Earner,"Silas Marner is the weaver in the English countryside village of Raveloe in the early nineteenth century. Like many weavers of his time, he is an outsider—the object of suspicion because of his special skills and the fact that he has come to Raveloe from elsewhere. The villagers see Silas as especially odd because of the curious cataleptic fits he occasionally suffers. Silas has ended up in Raveloe because the members of his religious sect in Lantern Yard, an insular neighborhood in a larger town, falsely accused him of theft and excommunicated him.
	Much shaken after the accusation, Silas finds nothing familiar in Raveloe to reawaken his faith and falls into a numbing routine of solitary work. His one attempt at neighborliness backfires: when an herbal remedy he suggests for a neighbor’s illness works, he is rumored to be a sort of witch doctor. With little else to live for, Silas becomes infatuated with the money he earns for his work and hoards it, living off as little as possible. Every night he pulls his gold out from its hiding place beneath his floorboards to count it. He carries on in this way for fifteen years.
	Squire Cass is the wealthiest man in Raveloe, and his two eldest sons are Godfrey and Dunstan, or Dunsey. Dunsey is greedy and cruel, and enjoys tormenting Godfrey, the eldest son. Godfrey is good-natured but weak-willed, and, though secretly married to the opium addict Molly Farren, he is in love with Nancy Lammeter. Dunsey talked Godfrey into the marriage and repeatedly blackmails him with threats to reveal the marriage to their father. Godfrey gives Dunsey 100 pounds of the rent money paid to him by one of their father’s tenants. Godfrey then finds himself in a bind when Dunsey insists that Godfrey repay the sum himself. Dunsey once again threatens to reveal Godfrey’s marriage but, after some arguing, offers to sell Godfrey’s prize horse, Wildfire, to repay the loan.
	The next day, Dunsey meets with some friends who are hunting and negotiates the sale of the horse. Dunsey decides to participate in the hunt before finalizing the sale, and, in doing so, he has a riding accident that kills the horse. Knowing the rumors of Silas’s hoard, Dunsey makes plans to intimidate the weaver into lending him money. His walk home takes him by Silas’s cottage, and, finding the cottage empty, Dunsey steals the money instead.
	Silas returns from an errand to find his money gone. Overwhelmed by the loss, he runs to the local tavern for help and announces the theft to a sympathetic audience of tavern regulars. The theft becomes the talk of the village, and a theory arises that the thief might have been a peddler who came through the village some time before. Godfrey, meanwhile, is distracted by thoughts of Dunsey, who has not returned home. After hearing that Wildfire has been found dead, Godfrey decides to tell his father about the money, though not about his marriage. The Squire flies into a rage at the news, but does not do anything drastic to punish Godfrey.
	Silas is utterly disconsolate at the loss of his gold and numbly continues his weaving. Some of the townspeople stop by to offer their condolences and advice. Among these visitors, Dolly Winthrop stands out. Like many of the others, she encourages Silas to go to church—something he has not done since he was banished from Lantern Yard—but she is also gentler and more genuinely sympathetic.
	Nancy Lammeter arrives at Squire Cass’s famed New Year’s dance resolved to reject Godfrey’s advances because of his unsound character. However, Godfrey is more direct and insistent than he has been in a long time, and Nancy finds herself exhilarated by the evening in spite of her resolution. Meanwhile, Molly, Godfrey’s secret wife, is making her way to the Casses’ house to reveal the secret marriage. She has their daughter, a toddler, in her arms. Tiring after her long walk, Molly takes a draft of opium and passes out by the road. Seeing Silas’s cottage and drawn by the light of the fire, Molly’s little girl wanders through the open door and falls asleep at Silas’s hearth.
	Silas is having one of his fits at the time and does not notice the little girl enter his cottage. When he comes to, he sees her already asleep on his hearth, and is as stunned by her appearance as he was by the disappearance of his money. A while later, Silas traces the girl’s footsteps outside and finds Molly’s body lying in the snow. Silas goes to the Squire’s house to find the doctor, and causes a stir at the dance when he arrives with the baby girl in his arms. Godfrey, recognizing his daughter, accompanies the doctor to Silas’s cottage. When the doctor declares that Molly is dead, Godfrey realizes that his secret is safe. He does not claim his daughter, and Silas adopts her.
	Silas grows increasingly attached to the child and names her Eppie, after his mother and sister. With Dolly Winthrop’s help, Silas raises the child lovingly. Eppie begins to serve as a bridge between Silas and the rest of the villagers, who offer him help and advice and have come to think of him as an exemplary person because of what he has done. Eppie also brings Silas out of the benumbed state he fell into after the loss of his gold. In his newfound happiness, Silas begins to explore the memories of his past that he has long repressed.
	The novel jumps ahead sixteen years. Godfrey has married Nancy and Squire Cass has died. Godfrey has inherited his father’s house, but he and Nancy have no children. Their one daughter died at birth, and Nancy has refused to adopt. Eppie has grown into a pretty and spirited young woman, and Silas a contented father. The stone-pit behind Silas’s cottage is drained to water neighboring fields, and Dunsey’s skeleton is found at the bottom, along with Silas’s gold. The discovery frightens Godfrey, who becomes convinced that his own secrets are destined to be uncovered as well. He confesses the truth to Nancy about his marriage to Molly and fathering of Eppie. Nancy is not angry but regretful, saying that they could have adopted Eppie legitimately if Godfrey had told her earlier.
	That evening, Godfrey and Nancy decide to visit Silas’s cottage to confess the truth of Eppie’s lineage and claim her as their daughter. However, after hearing Godfrey and Nancy’s story, Eppie tells them she would rather stay with Silas than live with her biological father. Godfrey and Nancy leave, resigning themselves to helping Eppie from afar. The next day Silas decides to visit Lantern Yard to see if he was ever cleared of the theft of which he was accused years before. The town has changed almost beyond recognition, though, and Silas’s old chapel has been torn down to make way for a new factory. Silas realizes that his questions will never be answered, but he is content with the sense of faith he has regained through his life with Eppie. That summer Eppie is married to Aaron Winthrop, Dolly’s son. Aaron comes to live in Silas’s cottage, which has been expanded and refurbished at Godfrey’s expense."
Faction,"Divergent is set in the future, in a dystopian version of Chicago that has been divided into five factions: Abnegation, Candor, Amity, Dauntless, and Erudite. The protagonist and narrator is a sixteen-year-old girl from Abnegation named Beatrice Prior.
The novel opens with Beatrice’s mother cutting her hair. Beatrice is worried about the next day’s aptitude test, which is administered to all sixteen-year-olds and will tell her which of the factions she is best suited for. After the test, she will attend the Choosing Ceremony, where she must decide whether to stay in her family’s faction or leave it behind.
Beatrice is sure that her brother Caleb will stay in Abnegation, which values selflessness and humility above all else, but she is conflicted. She has a strong desire to join Dauntless, the faction whose members value bravery. Trying to ignore her feelings, she goes in for her aptitude test, which is administered by a Dauntless woman named Tori. Tori injects Beatrice with a serum that initiates a series of simulations to which Beatrice must respond. After the test is over, Tori leaves the room looking concerned. When she returns, she tells Beatrice she is suited for multiple factions, meaning she’s what’s known as Divergent. Tori warns her not to tell anyone, and Beatrice returns home wondering what her results mean. At dinner that night, she tries to hide her conflicted feelings from her parents and brother.
The following day, all the families of sixteen-year-olds attend the Choosing Ceremony. Beatrice’s entire family is shocked when Caleb picks Erudite. After some hesitation, Beatrice chooses Dauntless. She leaves the building and jumps onto a train with the other initiates, where she meets Christina and Will, who will become her good friends. When they arrive at the Dauntless compound, a boy named Peter insults her. She responds by being the first person to jump into the Pit, Dauntless’s headquarters seven stories below. After a boy named Four helps her up, she introduces herself as Tris. The initiates proceed to the dining hall and Tris meets Eric, the ruthless head trainer of initiates. The next day, Eric tells the trainees that initiation consists of a three-stage ranking process. Those who rank high enough will become members, while the rest will become factionless. Tris vows to succeed and performs well on the first day of stage one, which involves shooting guns at targets. That night, Christina outfits Tris with flattering clothes and makeup, and she gets three birds tattooed on her collarbone to represent her family.
Next, the initiates must fight each other in an arena and try to knock each other unconscious. When Christina concedes to her opponent, Eric forces her to hang over a chasm in the Pit for five minutes as punishment. The following day, Tris finds that Peter has spray painted the word “Stiff” all over her bed. He also beats her in that day’s fight, sending her to the infirmary. She begins having doubts about her place in her new faction, and her worries intensify during a field trip to the compound wall to learn about Dauntless jobs. Late that night, Eric and Four take the initiates to Navy Pier, an abandoned park in the city, to play capture the flag. As Tris and Four climb a Ferris wheel so they can see where the other team is hiding, Tris realizes she’s starting to like him. She leads their team to victory, impressing Four and angering Eric. The following day, Tris’s friend Al performs badly during a knife-throwing exercise, and Eric orders him to stand in front of the target while others throw knives at him. Tris offers to take Al’s place, and Four throws knives around her head, nicking her ear.
Peter and his friends Molly and Drew continue to torment Tris. After they steal her towel and mock her naked body, she takes revenge by beating Molly up during their assigned fight. Tris finds comfort in her mother’s presence on Visiting Day, but the reunion is marred when Will’s sister accuses Tris’s former faction of hoarding food and goods. Taking Tris aside, her mother asks about her rankings and tells her to convince Caleb to research the simulation serum. The conversation makes Tris realize her mother must have come from Dauntless. Back in the dorm, Al puts his arm around Tris, but she rebuffs him. Later that evening, the rankings show that Tris in sixth place and Peter in second. That night, Edward, who placed first, gets stabbed in the eye, presumably by a jealous Peter. Tris is happy for a distraction the next day, when she gets invited to zip line off the top of the Hancock building with the Dauntless-born initiates.
In the second stage of initiation, the initiates are injected with a serum that induces a fear simulation. After Tris’s first simulation, Four informs her she was able to escape the test much faster than anyone else. Still, she is stressed about the tests and angry at Peter, who’s been distributing Erudite reports accusing Abnegation of corruption. After another trip to the tattoo parlor, she flirts with a drunken Four. During her next simulation, she escapes the hallucination by manipulating it, leading Four to realize she’s Divergent. He warns her not to share her status with anyone. She again talks with Tori, who tells Tris that Dauntless leaders killed her brother when they learned he was Divergent.
Because she’s able to manipulate the simulations, Tris ranks first after stage two, leading Peter to threaten her. One night, as she gets a drink of water in the hallway, she hears Eric talking with an unknown woman about Divergent rebels. Suddenly, she’s attacked from behind and taken to the chasm by Peter, Drew, and Al. One of the boys gropes her chest, and Peter nearly drops her over the edge before Four rescues her. As she recovers in Four’s private room, he advises Tris to feign weakness to stay safe, and they grow closer.
The next day, Tris refuses to accept Al’s apologies, and he commits suicide a few hours later by jumping into the chasm. At his funeral, Eric calls him brave, making Tris angry. She vents loudly about Dauntless’s warped priorities to Four, who warns her that she’s being watched. Frustrated and confused, she blows off steam with her friends by throwing stacks of Erudite reports into the chasm.
During stage three, the initiates are forced to confront all their worst fears in a simulation, but this time everyone knows the scenarios are made up, not just Tris. Tris follows Four up to the fear simulation room, where he sometimes goes to practice facing his phobias. He invites Tris into his simulation, and she learns he has only four fears. One of them is his father Marcus, who is Tris’s father’s colleague. After Tris helps Four through each scenario, he asks her to call him by his real name, Tobias, and they kiss.
The following day, Tobias ignores Tris in public, upsetting her. The initiates must go through a sample fear scenario, and Tris panics during hers, causing Tobias to rebuke her. She slaps him and leaves the Dauntless compound to see her brother Caleb in Erudite. When she finds him, he expresses loyalty to Erudite, angering her. She tells him their mother wants him to research the simulation serum, and then is taken by two men to see Jeanine, the Erudite leader. Jeanine asks probing questions about Tris’s test results, and Tris lies hide her Divergence. Back at Dauntless, when Eric threatens her with punishment for leaving, she and Tobias pretend she was sulking because Tobias rejected her. That night, Tobias takes Tris into the city and shows her that Erudite’s lights are on, a major rule violation. He has discovered that Erudite is planning a war against Abnegation, though he’s not sure how Dauntless is involved.
For the final test, each trainee goes through their fear simulation in front of a panel of judges, with the other initiates watching on screens. During Tris’s simulation, she realizes she needs to feel a sense of control in order to escape. Her creative thinking helps her manage her fears of crows, drowning, burning at the stake, kidnapping, and sex. Lastly, instead of following orders to shoot everyone in her family, she offers to sacrifice her own life. Afterward, Eric congratulates her on passing the test and informs her that all Dauntless members must be fitted with a tracking device. Though she’s suspicious, she allows him to inject her with the tracking serum. Back in Tobias’s room, Tris expresses her worries about sex, and she and Tobias agree they’re not ready for it. They go to the banquet, where Tris learns she’s placed first in the rankings. As she and Tobias kiss, she suddenly realizes the Erudite must be planning to use the tracking devices to control the Dauntless.
Tris doesn’t have time to share her realization with Tobias, and in the middle of the night, she awakens to find everyone leaving the dorm in a trance. Since she’s Divergent, the serum hasn’t worked on her, but she follows the group onto a train. There, she discovers Tobias is also awake, meaning he’s Divergent too. When they arrive at Abnegation, the Dauntless begin shooting everyone in sight. After she stops Eric from killing Tobias, Tris gets shot in the shoulder. She and Tobias are taken to Jeanine, who explains her plot to take over the government. She injects Tobias with a serum that makes him attack Tris. He’s sent away, while Tris is knocked unconscious.
Tris wakes up in a glass box filling slowly with water, just like in her simulations. Before she can drown, her mother appears and saves Tris’s life. Her mother is killed by Dauntless soldiers shortly afterward, and Tris kills Will in the process of escaping. She finds her father and brother hiding with other Abnegation members, including Marcus, Tobias’s father. They treat her wound, then head toward the control room at Dauntless headquarters. Tris leads her family into the Pit, where she finds Peter acting as a guard. Tris forces Peter to lead them to the control room, and her father is killed in the process of helping her. She finds Tobias, still under the influence of Jeanine’s serum, manning the computer program. They struggle to get each other’s weapons, and after she lets Tobias take her gun, she pleads with him to see her. He comes out of his trance and stops the computer program. Taking the hard drive with them, they reunite with Caleb and Marcus, then jump on a train heading toward Amity headquarters. Tris notices that Marcus seems interested in the hard drive and wonders what will happen next."
Declared,"In the year 1348, a great plague sweeps through Florence, Italy. The disease causes intense suffering and almost certain death. The city descends into panic and chaos. In response to the horror, ten young people abandon Florence for the countryside. The brigade includes seven women: Pampinea, Filomena, Neifile, Fiammetta, Elissa, Lauretta, and Emilia. The young men are Filostrato, Dioneo, and Panfilo. All the young people are attractive, prosperous, and well-bred.
Pampinea, the instigator of the plan to retreat, leads the companions and their seven servants to a villa outside Florence. Pampinea proposes that each day have a different ruler in charge of domestic arrangements and entertainment. After being chosen as the first queen, Pampinea suggests they gather every afternoon to take turns telling stories. Panfilo begins the storytelling with the tale of Ciappelletto, the worst man in the world, who tells blatant lies in his deathbed confession but becomes a saint after his death. After the tenth story, Pampinea chooses Filomena as queen of the second day. From then on, each day’s ruler selects and crowns the king or queen for the next day.
Filomena decrees that the second day’s topic will be people who suffer misfortune but unexpectedly find happiness. The companions walk in the garden, eat breakfast in the open air, and pass the day singing, dancing, and resting. In the late afternoon, they gather to tell stories about the turns of fortune, all with happy endings. For example, Elissa’s tale features Gualtieri, the noble Count of Antwerp, who is first favored by Fortune and then unfairly disgraced. After long years of exile, Gualtieri is declared innocent and restored to favor.
Neifile, queen of the third day, calls for stories about people who achieve their desires through their own efforts. She suggests that they refrain from telling stories for two days, Friday and Saturday, to catch up on domestic tasks and prepare for church on Sunday. Neifile also proposes that they move to a new location. On Sunday morning, right after church, the brigade walks to an elegant palace that has a magnificent walled garden with a lovely fountain and an abundance of flowers, trees, and animals. That evening, they gather at the fountain for their storytelling. All the stories feature people who use their intelligence to get what they want. Neifile tells the tale of Gilette, a physician’s daughter who is in love with a Count. Gilette travels to Paris, cures the King of a malady, and marries the Count as her reward.
Filostrato, king of the fourth day, chooses the topic of people whose loves end unhappily. Filostrato delays the storytelling with a long speech justifying his work as a writer. His companions are annoyed at Filostrato’s requirement for unhappy endings, but they follow his rules. Filomena tells about Lisabetta, who removes the head of her murdered lover Lorenzo, puts the head in a large pot, plants basil in the pot, and waters the basil with her tears. Eventually, Lisabetta dies of madness and grief.
Fiammetta is the queen of the fifth day. To counteract Filostrato’s sad topic, Fiammetta decrees that the fifth’s day’s tales will be about lovers who survive misfortunes and find happiness. On the fifth day, all the stories have happy endings. Filostrato makes amends with a romantic tale about Ricciardo, an eager young man who climbs up to a balcony and listens to the nightingales with Caterina, his lover.
Elissa, the ruler of the sixth day, chooses the topic of prompt retorts and shrewd maneuvers. The stories on the sixth day are short jokes with punch lines. For example, Lauretta tells about an insulting comment a bishop makes to a respectable woman and the even more insulting comment she makes in return. Because the stories are so short, the companions have time to visit a beautiful valley nearby and swim in a clear lake.
On the seventh day, Dioneo, the king, organizes a picnic in the valley. Dioneo calls for stories about tricks women play on their husbands. After a day of enjoying the pleasures of nature, the companions tell short funny stories about women’s tricks. The jokes are at the husbands’ expense. Once again,the storytelling pauses on Friday and Saturday.
For Sunday, the eighth day of storytelling, the queen, Lauretta, requests stories about tricks that people in general play on each other. Fiammetta contributes the tale of Spinelloccio and Zeppa, two lifelong friends and neighbors. Spinelloccio and Zeppa’s wife become lovers. Zeppa discovers their secret. With his wife’s help, Zeppa tricks Spinelloccio into hiding inside a chest. Then Zeppa seduces Spinelloccio’s wife on top of the chest. Zeppa and Spinelloccio resolve the issue by sharing their wives.
Emilia, the ruler of the ninth day, allows the companions to pick any topic they please. She tells a story set in the Holy Land. Two young men, Melissus and Joseph, seek King Solomon’s advice. Melissus wants to know what he must do to be loved. Solomon’s cryptic advice to Melissus means that he must love in order to be loved. Joseph wants to know how he can get his perverse, stubborn wife to obey him. Solomon’s advice to Joseph, again offered cryptically, is to beat his wife.
Panfilo, the ruler of the tenth day, asks for stories about liberal or munificent deeds. In the final story of the retreat, Dioneo honors Griselda, a poor and very beautiful young girl who Gualtieri, a nobleman, marries on a whim. Although Griselda is a perfect wife, Gualtieri decides to test her patience. He pretends to have their children put to death, but Griselda does not chastise him. Gualtieri casts Griselda out of the house and returns her dowry. Griselda bravely accepts the cruel assault of Fortune. In the end, Gualtieri recognizes Griselda’s worth and restores her to her rightful place. The story of Griselda is the last of the one hundred stories told by the friends. After the story ends, they spend the evening singing and dancing. The next day they rise at dawn and return to Florence."
Planning,"Rashad and Quinn are both students at Springfield Central High School. They have some friends in common but have never interacted with each other. Rashad is Black, and his father has told him throughout his life about the importance of discipline for young Black men. Rashad’s father joined the army and then the police force before retiring and often tells Rashad that the army is the best opportunity for a Black man to succeed in the United States. Because of this, Rashad is part of the Reserve Officer Training Corps, or ROTC. However, Rashad would rather spend his time drawing and hanging out with his friends English, Shannon, and Carlos. 
Quinn is white, and his father died in Afghanistan. Quinn lives with his mother and his younger brother, Willy, and resents that people expect him to live up to the memory of his father. Quinn’s best friends are Dwyer and Guzzo, who lives across the street. Guzzo’s brother, Paul Galluzzo, is a police officer and has acted as a father figure to Quinn ever since Quinn’s father died. Quinn, Dwyer, and Guzzo are on the basketball team together, along with English.
One Friday, Rashad and Quinn are each planning on going to a party with their friends at Guzzo and Paul’s cousin Jill’s house. Quinn has a crush on Jill. On the way to the party, Rashad stops at Jerry’s Corner Mart to pick up some chips and gum. Jerry’s is always monitored by a police officer as a response to shoplifting incidents at the store. While Rashad is picking out chips, he goes to text his brother, Spoony. His phone is in his bag, so he puts it on the floor and kneels down to take the phone out. While he is kneeling, a woman who was standing behind him backs up and trips over him, causing them both to fall over and Rashad’s chips to slide up the aisle. 
The police officer on duty comes over and asks what happened but assumes Rashad was trying to steal before Rashad or the woman can explain. The police officer drags Rashad outside, handcuffs him, throws him to the ground, and begins beating him. Meanwhile, Quinn and his friends have been waiting in the alley next to Jerry’s to ask an adult to buy them beer that they can take to the party. When Quinn goes around to the front of Jerry’s, he sees what the police officer is doing to Rashad. He recognizes the police officer as Paul Galluzzo. He tells his friends to run and, when they are far enough away, explains what happened and tells Guzzo that he saw his brother. The three decide to go to the party and try to forget about it.
Over the weekend, Rashad wakes up in the hospital with a broken nose and ribs and is told he needs to stay there so the doctors can monitor his internal bleeding. Rashad’s father questions whether Rashad was presenting himself in a way that made him seem dangerous, while Spoony is outraged at the situation. The local news obtains footage of Paul beating Rashad and begins covering the story. The Galluzzo family decides to have a cookout on Sunday, which Quinn and Jill both find strange. Quinn and Jill talk at the cookout about what Paul did to Rashad, while Paul and Guzzo try to intimidate Quinn into not saying anything about what he saw.
At school that week, everyone is talking about what happened to Rashad. Quinn feels conflicted as he has only ever seen the good side of Paul and doesn’t know Rashad. On Tuesday, someone has painted graffiti on the sidewalk in front of the school that says, “Rashad is absent again today.” This message creates a division in the school between those who believe Rashad was innocent and those who believe Paul was just doing his job. When Rashad sees a picture of the graffiti, he knows it is Carlos’s work. 
Spoony and his girlfriend, Berry, plan a protest that coming Friday against the police department. Guzzo continues to question Quinn’s loyalty. At first, Quinn wants to believe that Paul was just trying to do his job, but he just can’t forget what he saw outside Jerry’s. On Thursday, Quinn wears a shirt to school that says, “I’m marching. Are you?” The coach of the basketball team tells the players not to go to the protest and tells Quinn he will call his mother to tell her about his shirt. Quinn’s mother confronts him about the protest, and Quinn says he is standing up for what he believes in, just as his father would have done.
The doctor releases Rashad from the hospital on Thursday, and Rashad plans on joining the protest the following day. On Friday morning, Rashad and Quinn both feel nervous about the protest. Quinn sees a tank-like police vehicle headed toward the school and worries about the protesters’ safety. However, after talking with Jill, he understands that Black people live in fear of police violence every day and that they should put themselves at risk for one day to speak out against this reality. Rashad and Quinn, along with an enormous crowd, march from Jerry’s Corner Mart to the police department, where they stage a die-in as Berry reads aloud the names of unarmed Black people killed by police officers. Rashad and Quinn notice each other during the die-in and feel a connection as they both think of the people on the list and how they will keep fighting for them."
Passed,"Irene Redfield is a light-skinned Black woman who, in public places, occasionally passes for white, when she finds it convenient. Irene is a practical, determined person. She was born and raised in Chicago but now lives in Harlem with her husband, Brian, and their two boys. Brian is a successful doctor but dislikes his work. He would have preferred to move the entire family to another, less racist country long ago, but Irene has always insisted that the family belongs in New York.
One day, while back in Chicago for a visit, Irene has a chance meeting with a childhood friend, Clare. Clare is very different from Irene—self-centered, melodramatic, and reckless. Clare is even lighter-skinned than Irene, and in fact she has married a white man, John Bellew, without telling him that she is Black. They have a daughter. The Bellews live mostly in Europe but often spend time in the Unites States, depending on where John Bellew’s work in international banking takes him. Irene finds Clare strangely fascinating but does not like her company. She only reluctantly agrees to visit Clare at the Bellews’ hotel suite. Clare has invited a mutual light-skinned friend of theirs to join them. When John Bellew arrives, Irene is shocked to learn that he is a vehement racist. He openly declares that he hates Black people, not knowing that he is speaking to three of them.
Two years later, the Bellews have relocated to New York. Clare resumes contact with Irene, and Irene is not firm enough to insist that Clare leave her alone, if only to keep Clare’s secret safe. When Clare learns that Irene is planning a charity event at which upper-class Black people and white people will mingle, Clare insists on attending. Soon, she is at the Redfields’ home regularly and has become part of their social circle. In time, Irene suspects that Clare and Brian are having an affair. The Bellews are due to move back to Europe soon, but a chance downtown encounter between John Bellew and Irene, while Irene is with a darker-skinned friend, creates a crisis. If Bellew deduces that Clare, like Irene, is Black, he may divorce Clare and leave her free to pursue Brian.
The threat that Clare poses for Irene’s marriage and family life is unexpectedly removed when Bellew tracks Clare down at an all-Black party hosted by friends of the Redfields in their apartment atop a high residential building. Bellew angrily confronts Clare, but Clare smiles and acts unconcerned. When Irene angrily moves toward Clare and puts her hand on Clare’s arm, Clare tumbles out a nearby open window, to her death. The cause of her fall is unclear—whether she fainted and fell by accident, or fell deliberately. It is also possible that Irene pushed Clare, but no one accuses her."
Argument,"In the Puritan New England town of Salem, Massachusetts, a group of girls goes dancing in the forest with a black slave named Tituba. While dancing, they are caught by the local minister, Reverend Parris. One of the girls, Parris’s daughter Betty, falls into a coma-like state. A crowd gathers in the Parris home while rumors of witchcraft fill the town. Having sent for Reverend Hale, an expert on witchcraft, Parris questions Abigail Williams, the girls’ ringleader, about the events that took place in the forest. Abigail, who is Parris’s niece and ward, admits to doing nothing beyond “dancing.”
While Parris tries to calm the crowd that has gathered in his home, Abigail talks to some of the other girls, telling them not to admit to anything. John Proctor, a local farmer, then enters and talks to Abigail alone. Unbeknownst to anyone else in the town, while working in Proctor’s home the previous year she engaged in an affair with him, which led to her being fired by his wife, Elizabeth. Abigail still desires Proctor, but he fends her off and tells her to end her foolishness with the girls.
Betty wakes up and begins screaming. Much of the crowd rushes upstairs and gathers in her bedroom, arguing over whether she is bewitched. A separate argument between Proctor, Parris, the argumentative Giles Corey, and the wealthy Thomas Putnam soon ensues. This dispute centers on money and land deeds, and it suggests that deep fault lines run through the Salem community. As the men argue, Reverend Hale arrives and examines Betty, while Proctor departs. Hale quizzes Abigail about the girls’ activities in the forest, grows suspicious of her behavior, and demands to speak to Tituba. After Parris and Hale interrogate her for a brief time, Tituba confesses to communing with the devil, and she hysterically accuses various townsfolk of consorting with the devil. Suddenly, Abigail joins her, confessing to having seen the devil conspiring and cavorting with other townspeople. Betty joins them in naming witches, and the crowd is thrown into an uproar.
A week later, alone in their farmhouse outside of town, John and Elizabeth Proctor discuss the ongoing trials and the escalating number of townsfolk who have been accused of being witches. Elizabeth urges her husband to denounce Abigail as a fraud; he refuses, and she becomes jealous, accusing him of still harboring feelings for her. Mary Warren, their servant and one of Abigail’s circle, returns from Salem with news that Elizabeth has been accused of witchcraft but the court did not pursue the accusation. Mary is sent up to bed, and John and Elizabeth continue their argument, only to be interrupted by a visit from Reverend Hale. While they discuss matters, Giles Corey and Francis Nurse come to the Proctor home with news that their wives have been arrested. Officers of the court suddenly arrive and arrest Elizabeth. After they have taken her, Proctor browbeats Mary, insisting that she must go to Salem and expose Abigail and the other girls as frauds.
The next day, Proctor brings Mary to court and tells Judge Danforth that she will testify that the girls are lying. Danforth is suspicious of Proctor’s motives and tells Proctor, truthfully, that Elizabeth is pregnant and will be spared for a time. Proctor persists in his charge, convincing Danforth to allow Mary to testify. Mary tells the court that the girls are lying. When the girls are brought in, they turn the tables by accusing Mary of bewitching them. Furious, Proctor confesses his affair with Abigail and accuses her of being motivated by jealousy of his wife. To test Proctor’s claim, Danforth summons Elizabeth and asks her if Proctor has been unfaithful to her. Despite her natural honesty, she lies to protect Proctor’s honor, and Danforth denounces Proctor as a liar. Meanwhile, Abigail and the girls again pretend that Mary is bewitching them, and Mary breaks down and accuses Proctor of being a witch. Proctor rages against her and against the court. He is arrested, and Hale quits the proceedings.
The summer passes and autumn arrives. The witch trials have caused unrest in neighboring towns, and Danforth grows nervous. Abigail has run away, taking all of Parris’s money with her. Hale, who has lost faith in the court, begs the accused witches to confess falsely in order to save their lives, but they refuse. Danforth, however, has an idea: he asks Elizabeth to talk John into confessing, and she agrees. Conflicted, but desiring to live, John agrees to confess, and the officers of the court rejoice. But he refuses to incriminate anyone else, and when the court insists that the confession must be made public, Proctor grows angry, tears it up, and retracts his admission of guilt. Despite Hale’s desperate pleas, Proctor goes to the gallows with the others, and the witch trials reach their awful conclusion."
Mr,"On their weekly walk, an eminently sensible, trustworthy lawyer named Mr. Utterson listens as his friend Enfield tells a gruesome tale of assault. The tale describes a sinister figure named Mr. Hyde who tramples a young girl, disappears into a door on the street, and reemerges to pay off her relatives with a check signed by a respectable gentleman. Since both Utterson and Enfield disapprove of gossip, they agree to speak no further of the matter. It happens, however, that one of Utterson’s clients and close friends, Dr. Jekyll, has written a will transferring all of his property to this same Mr. Hyde. Soon, Utterson begins having dreams in which a faceless figure stalks through a nightmarish version of London.
Puzzled, the lawyer visits Jekyll and their mutual friend Dr. Lanyon to try to learn more. Lanyon reports that he no longer sees much of Jekyll, since they had a dispute over the course of Jekyll’s research, which Lanyon calls “unscientific balderdash.” Curious, Utterson stakes out a building that Hyde visits—which, it turns out, is a laboratory attached to the back of Jekyll’s home. Encountering Hyde, Utterson is amazed by how undefinably ugly the man seems, as if deformed, though Utterson cannot say exactly how. Much to Utterson’s surprise, Hyde willingly offers Utterson his address. Jekyll tells Utterson not to concern himself with the matter of Hyde.
A year passes uneventfully. Then, one night, a servant girl witnesses Hyde brutally beat to death an old man named Sir Danvers Carew, a member of Parliament and a client of Utterson. The police contact Utterson, and Utterson suspects Hyde as the murderer. He leads the officers to Hyde’s apartment, feeling a sense of foreboding amid the eerie weather—the morning is dark and wreathed in fog. When they arrive at the apartment, the murderer has vanished, and police searches prove futile. Shortly thereafter, Utterson again visits Jekyll, who now claims to have ended all relations with Hyde; he shows Utterson a note, allegedly written to Jekyll by Hyde, apologizing for the trouble he has caused him and saying goodbye. That night, however, Utterson’s clerk points out that Hyde’s handwriting bears a remarkable similarity to Jekyll’s own.
For a few months, Jekyll acts especially friendly and sociable, as if a weight has been lifted from his shoulders. But then Jekyll suddenly begins to refuse visitors, and Lanyon dies from some kind of shock he received in connection with Jekyll. Before dying, however, Lanyon gives Utterson a letter, with instructions that he not open it until after Jekyll’s death. Meanwhile, Utterson goes out walking with Enfield, and they see Jekyll at a window of his laboratory; the three men begin to converse, but a look of horror comes over Jekyll’s face, and he slams the window and disappears. Soon afterward, Jekyll’s butler, Mr. Poole, visits Utterson in a state of desperation: Jekyll has secluded himself in his laboratory for several weeks, and now the voice that comes from the room sounds nothing like the doctor’s. Utterson and Poole travel to Jekyll’s house through empty, windswept, sinister streets; once there, they find the servants huddled together in fear. After arguing for a time, the two of them resolve to break into Jekyll’s laboratory. Inside, they find the body of Hyde, wearing Jekyll’s clothes and apparently dead by suicide—and a letter from Jekyll to Utterson promising to explain everything.
Utterson takes the document home, where first he reads Lanyon’s letter; it reveals that Lanyon’s deterioration and eventual death were caused by the shock of seeing Mr. Hyde take a potion and metamorphose into Dr. Jekyll. The second letter constitutes a testament by Jekyll. It explains how Jekyll, seeking to separate his good side from his darker impulses, discovered a way to transform himself periodically into a deformed monster free of conscience—Mr. Hyde. At first, Jekyll reports, he delighted in becoming Hyde and rejoiced in the moral freedom that the creature possessed. Eventually, however, he found that he was turning into Hyde involuntarily in his sleep, even without taking the potion. At this point, Jekyll resolved to cease becoming Hyde. One night, however, the urge gripped him too strongly, and after the transformation he immediately rushed out and violently killed Sir Danvers Carew. Horrified, Jekyll tried more adamantly to stop the transformations, and for a time he proved successful; one day, however, while sitting in a park, he suddenly turned into Hyde, the first time that an involuntary metamorphosis had happened while he was awake.
The letter continues describing Jekyll’s cry for help. Far from his laboratory and hunted by the police as a murderer, Hyde needed Lanyon’s help to get his potions and become Jekyll again—but when he undertook the transformation in Lanyon’s presence, the shock of the sight instigated Lanyon’s deterioration and death. Meanwhile, Jekyll returned to his home, only to find himself ever more helpless and trapped as the transformations increased in frequency and necessitated even larger doses of potion in order to reverse themselves. It was the onset of one of these spontaneous metamorphoses that caused Jekyll to slam his laboratory window shut in the middle of his conversation with Enfield and Utterson. Eventually, the potion began to run out, and Jekyll was unable to find a key ingredient to make more. His ability to change back from Hyde into Jekyll slowly vanished. Jekyll writes that even as he composes his letter he knows that he will soon become Hyde permanently, and he wonders if Hyde will face execution for his crimes or choose to kill himself. Jekyll notes that, in any case, the end of his letter marks the end of the life of Dr. Jekyll. With these words, both the document and the novel come to a close."
Sensitive,"When Mr. Henry Dashwood dies, leaving all his money to his first wife's son John Dashwood, his second wife and her three daughters are left with no permanent home and very little income. Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters (Elinor, Marianne, and Margaret) are invited to stay with their distant relations, the Middletons, at Barton Park. Elinor is sad to leave their home at Norland because she has become closely attached to Edward Ferrars, the brother-in-law of her half-brother John. However, once at Barton Park, Elinor and Marianne discover many new acquaintances, including the retired officer and bachelor Colonel Brandon, and the gallant and impetuous John Willoughby, who rescues Marianne after she twists her ankle running down the hills of Barton in the rain. Willoughby openly and unabashedly courts Marianne, and together the two flaunt their attachment to one another, until Willoughby suddenly announces that he must depart for London on business, leaving Marianne lovesick and miserable. Meanwhile, Anne and Lucy Steele, two recently discovered relations of Lady Middleton's mother, Mrs. Jennings, arrive at Barton Park as guests of the Middletons. Lucy ingratiates herself to Elinor and informs her that she (Lucy) has been secretly engaged to Mr. Ferrars for a whole year. Elinor initially assumes that Lucy is referring to Edward's younger brother, Robert, but is shocked and pained to learn that Lucy is actually referring to her own beloved Edward.
In Volume II of the novel, Elinor and Marianne travel to London with Mrs. Jennings. Colonel Brandon informs Elinor that everyone in London is talking of an engagement between Willoughby and Marianne, though Marianne has not told her family of any such attachment. Marianne is anxious to be reunited with her beloved Willoughby, but when she sees him at a party in town, he cruelly rebuffs her and then sends her a letter denying that he ever had feelings for her. Colonel Brandon tells Elinor of Willoughby's history of callousness and debauchery, and Mrs. Jennings confirms that Willoughby, having squandered his fortune, has become engaged to the wealthy heiress Miss Grey.
In Volume III, Lucy's older sister inadvertently reveals the news of Lucy's secret engagement to Edward Ferrars. Edward's mother is outraged at the information and disinherits him, promising his fortune to Robert instead. Meanwhile, the Dashwood sisters visit family friends at Cleveland on their way home from London. At Cleveland, Marianne develops a severe cold while taking long walks in the rain, and she falls deathly ill. Upon hearing of her illness, Willoughby comes to visit, attempting to explain his misconduct and seek forgiveness. Elinor pities him and ultimately shares his story with Marianne, who finally realizes that she behaved imprudently with Willoughby and could never have been happy with him anyway. Mrs. Dashwood and Colonel Brandon arrive at Cleveland and are relieved to learn that Marianne has begun to recover.
When the Dashwoods return to Barton, they learn from their manservant that Lucy Steele and Mr. Ferrars are engaged. They assume that he means Edward Ferrars, and are thus unsurprised, but Edward himself soon arrives and corrects their misconception: it was Robert, not himself, whom the money-grubbing Lucy ultimately decided to marry. Thus,x Edward is finally free to propose to his beloved Elinor, and not long after, Marianne and Colonel Brandon become engaged as well. The couples live together at Delaford and remain in close touch with their mother and younger sister at Barton Cottage."
Named,"Blanche DuBois, a schoolteacher from Laurel, Mississippi, arrives at the New Orleans apartment of her sister, Stella Kowalski. Despite the fact that Blanche seems to have fallen out of close contact with Stella, she intends to stay at Stella’s apartment for an unspecified but likely lengthy period of time, given the large trunk she has with her. Blanche tells Stella that she lost Belle Reve, their ancestral home, following the death of all their remaining relatives. She also mentions that she has been given a leave of absence from her teaching position because of her bad nerves.
Though Blanche does not seem to have enough money to afford a hotel, she is disdainful of the cramped quarters of the Kowalskis’ two-room apartment and of the apartment’s location in a noisy, diverse, working-class neighborhood. Blanche’s social condescension wins her the instant dislike of Stella’s husband, an auto-parts supply man of Polish descent named Stanley Kowalski. It is clear that Stella was happy to leave behind her the social pretensions of her background in exchange for the sexual gratification she gets from her husband; she even is pregnant with his baby. Stanley immediately distrusts Blanche to the extent that he suspects her of having cheated Stella out of her share of the family inheritance. In the process of defending herself to Stanley, Blanche reveals that Belle Reve was lost due to a foreclosed mortgage, a disclosure that signifies the dire nature of Blanche’s financial circumstances. Blanche’s heavy drinking, which she attempts to conceal from her sister and brother-in-law, is another sign that all is not well with Blanche.
The unhappiness that accompanies the animal magnetism of Stella and Stanley’s marriage reveals itself when Stanley hosts a drunken poker game with his male friends at the apartment. Blanche gets under Stanley’s skin, especially when she starts to win the affections of his close friend Mitch. After Mitch has been absent for a while, speaking with Blanche in the bedroom, Stanley erupts, storms into the bedroom, and throws the radio out of the window. When Stella yells at Stanley and defends Blanche, Stanley beats her. The men pull him off, the poker game breaks up, and Blanche and Stella escape to their upstairs neighbor Eunice’s apartment. A short while later, Stanley is remorseful and cries up to Stella to forgive him. To Blanche’s alarm, Stella returns to Stanley and embraces him passionately. Mitch meets Blanche outside of the Kowalski flat and comforts her in her distress.
The next day, Blanche tries to convince Stella to leave Stanley for a better man whose social status equals Stella’s. Blanche suggests that she and Stella contact a millionaire named Shep Huntleigh for help escaping from New Orleans; when Stella laughs at her, Blanche reveals that she is completely broke. Stanley walks in as Blanche is making fun of him and secretly overhears Blanche and Stella’s conversation. Later, he threatens Blanche with hints that he has heard rumors of her disreputable past. She is visibly dismayed.
While Blanche is alone in the apartment one evening, waiting for Mitch to pick her up for a date, a teenage boy comes by to collect money for the newspaper. Blanche doesn’t have any money for him, but she hits on him and gives him a lustful kiss. Soon after the boy departs, Mitch arrives, and they go on their date. When Blanche returns, she is exhausted and clearly has been uneasy for the entire night about the rumors Stanley mentioned earlier. In a surprisingly sincere heart-to-heart discussion with Mitch, Blanche reveals the greatest tragedy of her past. Years ago, her young husband committed suicide after she discovered and chastised him for his homosexuality. Mitch describes his own loss of a former love, and he tells Blanche that they need each other.
When the next scene begins, about one month has passed. It is the afternoon of Blanche’s birthday. Stella is preparing a dinner for Blanche, Mitch, Stanley, and herself, when Stanley comes in to tell her that he has learned news of Blanche’s sordid past. He says that after losing the DuBois mansion, Blanche moved into a fleabag motel from which she was eventually evicted because of her numerous sexual liaisons. Also, she was fired from her job as a schoolteacher because the principal discovered that she was having an affair with a teenage student. Stella is horrified to learn that Stanley has told Mitch these stories about Blanche.
The birthday dinner comes and goes, but Mitch never arrives. Stanley indicates to Blanche that he is aware of her past. For a birthday present, he gives her a one-way bus ticket back to Laurel. Stanley’s cruelty so disturbs Stella that it appears the Kowalski household is about to break up, but the onset of Stella’s labor prevents the imminent fight.
Several hours later, Blanche, drunk, sits alone in the apartment. Mitch, also drunk, arrives and repeats all he’s learned from Stanley. Eventually Blanche confesses that the stories are true, but she also reveals the need for human affection she felt after her husband’s death. Mitch tells Blanche that he can never marry her, saying she isn’t fit to live in the same house as his mother. Having learned that Blanche is not the chaste lady she pretended to be, Mitch tries to have sex with Blanche, but she forces him to leave by yelling “Fire!” to attract the attention of passersby outside.
Later, Stanley returns from the hospital to find Blanche even more drunk. She tells him that she will soon be leaving New Orleans with her former suitor Shep Huntleigh, who is now a millionaire. Stanley knows that Blanche’s story is entirely in her imagination, but he is so happy about his baby that he proposes they each celebrate their good fortune. Blanche spurns Stanley, and things grow contentious. When she tries to step past him, he refuses to move out of her way. Blanche becomes terrified to the point that she smashes a bottle on the table and threatens to smash Stanley in the face. Stanley grabs her arm and says that it’s time for the “date” they’ve had set up since Blanche’s arrival. Blanche resists, but Stanley uses his physical strength to overcome her, and he carries her to bed. The pulsing music indicates that Stanley rapes Blanche.
The next scene takes place weeks later, as Stella and her neighbor Eunice pack Blanche’s bags. Blanche is in the bath, and Stanley plays poker with his buddies in the front room. A doctor will arrive soon to take Blanche to an insane asylum, but Blanche believes she is leaving to join her millionaire. Stella confesses to Eunice that she simply cannot allow herself to believe Blanche’s assertion that Stanley raped her. When Blanche emerges from the bathroom, her deluded talk makes it clear that she has lost her grip on reality.
The doctor arrives with a nurse, and Blanche initially panics and struggles against them when they try to take her away. Stanley and his friends fight to subdue Blanche, while Eunice holds Stella back to keep her from interfering. Mitch begins to cry. Finally, the doctor approaches Blanche in a gentle manner and convinces her to leave with him. She allows him to lead her away and does not look back or say goodbye as she goes. Stella sobs with her child in her arms, and Stanley comforts her with loving words and caresses."
Inadequate,"In 1998, Barbara Ehrenreich, a journalist and activist then in her late 50s, sets out to document the daily struggles of America’s working poor. Having trained as a biologist, she decides to do fieldwork: in three different U.S. cities, she takes minimum-wage jobs and looks for affordable places to live. She leaves her Ph.D. and most of her skills off of her applications, to ensure that she is given the lowest-level positions available to a white, native-English speaking woman. However, she will use outside cash, if necessary, to ensure that she will never be without a car, she will not have to skip meals to save money, and she will never be homeless.
Ehrenreich’s first experiences are in Key West, Florida. Her most affordable living option, cheaper than a trailer in town, is a shabby efficiency apartment thirty miles away. Although she expects to earn $7 per hour, the first job she lands, as a diner waitress, pays much less, because she will also earn tips. The job requires not only serving tables but also additional work, like cleaning and restocking. Although Ehrenreich gets along well with her coworkers, she struggles as a waitress, because of her lack of experience. Realizing that she will not be able to stay in her apartment on what she is earning, she tries takes a second waitressing job, at another diner. She quickly realizes she will be physically unable to work both jobs, quits the first job, and takes a hotel housekeeping job next door to the second diner, instead. However, when her supervisor at the second diner yells at her, Ehrenreich has had enough and walks out.
Ehrenreich’s next location is Portland, Maine. There, after much searching, she finds a small apartment she will be able to afford. She takes two jobs. The first is with a maid service that cleans the homes of affluent clients where she works on a cleaning team with several other women. The work is back-breaking, and Ehrenreich develops a skin rash of unknown origin. She sees the other women continue to work even when they are injured or feeling sick. She notices that the cleaning techniques the team is taught to use are more about making homes look cleaner than about actually cleaning them. She learns that her employer charges customers $25 per person-hour, while she will earn $6.65 an hour. Ehrenreich’s other job is at a nursing home, where she helps serve food to residents with Alzheimer’s. The interactions with the residents are pleasant, but the cleanup work after meals is overwhelming, partly because one of the automatic dishwashers is broken.
In Minneapolis, Minnesota, finally, Ehrenreich has a very hard time finding safe, sanitary housing she can afford. A charity worker suggests that she check into a shelter while saving up first month’s rent. She has two job applications accepted, but backs out of one job, at a hardware store, when her very first shift is scheduled to last eleven hours without overtime pay. The other job is in women’s clothing at Wal-Mart. The day-long orientation for new employees includes criticism of labor unions, while the pay is less than typical for the area. The store layout is constantly changing, and customers make extra work for her by leaving unbought merchandise in other departments. The job makes Ehrenreich, by her own account, callous and spiteful. Meanwhile, she has been unable to secure a long-term rental situation. Fed up, at one of the employee meetings she starts talking about the need for a union. By now, she has already decided to quit.
Reviewing her experiences in light of the data from many different studies, Ehrenreich comes to several conclusions. She finds that workers cannot support themselves on minimum wage in America unless they work multiple jobs, and only so long as there are no unexpected expenses, such as for medical care. Ehrenreich also finds that employers try to keep information about the wages they pay from becoming general knowledge among workers. Additionally, she finds that the ways in which workers are supervised, including random urine tests for drug use, encourage the workers to accept being dehumanized. Ehrenreich adds that the attitudes found in managers of low-wage employees are based on class or racial prejudice. Finally, she states that medical benefits and child care are too expensive even for middle-class workers, let alone ones on minimum wage. She notes that perhaps someday the working poor will refuse to stop accepting their situation and will demand that things change—and concludes that the country will be a better place when they do."
Aftermath,"On August 6, 1945, the American army decimates the city of Hiroshima with a bomb of enormous power; out of a population of 250,000, the bomb kills nearly 100,000 people and injures 100,000 more. In its original edition, Hersey’s Hiroshima traces the lives of six survivors—two doctors, two women, and two religious men—from the moment the bomb drops until a few months later. In 1985, Hersey added a postscript that now forms the book’s fifth chapter. In this chapter, Hersey reexamines these six individuals’ lives in the forty years since the bomb.
	The Reverend Mr. Kiyoshi Tanimoto, a community leader and an American-educated Methodist pastor, is uninjured by the explosion. As fires spread around the city, he helps get people to safety at a small park on the outskirts of the city. Tanimoto is aided by Father Wilhelm Kleinsorge, a Jesuit priest. Despite his own illness, Father Kleinsorge consoles the wounded and brings water to those who need it. Many of the victims are too weak or wounded to move, and in the absence of any official help, people like Father Kleinsorge and Mr. Tanimoto are left to protect them from encroaching fires, whirlwinds, and the rising tide of the river. Among the victims they help are Mrs. Hatsuyo Nakamura and her young children.
	Miss Toshiko Sasaki is a young clerk whose leg is fractured in the blast. Her wound becomes terribly infected, and she receives no real medical help for weeks after the explosion. The bomb kills more than half the doctors in Hiroshima and injures most of the rest; Dr. Masakazu Fujii, for instance, is unable to help anybody but himself for a long while. Dr. Terufumi Sasaki, on the other hand, remains the only uninjured doctor on the staff of the Red Cross Hospital, and in the months after the explosion he barely leaves his post, trying to stem the tide of death rising around him.
	Weeks after the explosion, after Japan capitulates and Hiroshima begins to rebuild, a new terror strikes: radiation sickness. Victims become nauseated, feverish, and anemic; many people, such as Mrs. Nakamura, watch their hair fall out. The disease baffles everyone, and many, including Father Kleinsorge, never fully recover. Still, the people of Hiroshima try to return to their normal lives. In his added postscript, Hersey traces the lives of these six characters in the forty years after the atomic bomb. Father Kleinsorge and Dr. Fujii die from sudden illnesses years later. Mrs. Nakamura and Miss Sasaki scrape their way up from the bottom to become happy and successful. After working hard and supporting her family, Mrs. Nakamura lives comfortably on a pension and a government allowance, and Miss Sasaki becomes a nun. Dr. Sasaki and Mr. Tanimoto devote their lives to helping people. Mr. Tanimoto in particular plays an important role in trying to help the victims of the bomb—most notably the Hiroshima Maidens, whose burns are so bad that they require plastic surgery. He becomes a minor celebrity in America and somewhat unsuccessfully tries to spread a message of peace in a time of nuclear escalation.
	In the end, Hersey finds that the horrors of nuclear war are far from over—the citizens of Hiroshima still suffer from aftereffects, and nuclear escalation continues to threaten the entire world. Hersey also finds that these six people show, in the aftermath of the bomb and the war, remarkable feelings of good will, reconciliation, and pride."
Active,"Okonkwo is a wealthy and respected warrior of the Umuofia clan, a lower Nigerian tribe that is part of a consortium of nine connected villages. He is haunted by the actions of Unoka, his cowardly and spendthrift father, who died in disrepute, leaving many village debts unsettled. In response, Okonkwo became a clansman, warrior, farmer, and family provider extraordinaire. He has a twelve-year-old son named Nwoye whom he finds lazy; Okonkwo worries that Nwoye will end up a failure like Unoka.
In a settlement with a neighboring tribe, Umuofia wins a virgin and a fifteen-year-old boy. Okonkwo takes charge of the boy, Ikemefuna, and finds an ideal son in him. Nwoye likewise forms a strong attachment to the newcomer. Despite his fondness for Ikemefuna and despite the fact that the boy begins to call him “father,” Okonkwo does not let himself show any affection for him.
During the Week of Peace, Okonkwo accuses his youngest wife, Ojiugo, of negligence. He severely beats her, breaking the peace of the sacred week. He makes some sacrifices to show his repentance, but he has shocked his community irreparably.
Ikemefuna stays with Okonkwo’s family for three years. Nwoye looks up to him as an older brother and, much to Okonkwo’s pleasure, develops a more masculine attitude. One day, the locusts come to Umuofia—they will come every year for seven years before disappearing for another generation. The village excitedly collects them because they are good to eat when cooked.
Ogbuefi Ezeudu, a respected village elder, informs Okonkwo in private that the Oracle has said that Ikemefuna must be killed. He tells Okonkwo that because Ikemefuna calls him “father,” Okonkwo should not take part in the boy’s death. Okonkwo lies to Ikemefuna, telling him that they must return him to his home village. Nwoye bursts into tears.
As he walks with the men of Umuofia, Ikemefuna thinks about seeing his mother. After several hours of walking, some of Okonkwo’s clansmen attack the boy with machetes. Ikemefuna runs to Okonkwo for help. But Okonkwo, who doesn’t wish to look weak in front of his fellow tribesmen, cuts the boy down despite the Oracle’s admonishment. When Okonkwo returns home, Nwoye deduces that his friend is dead.
Okonkwo sinks into a depression, neither able to sleep nor eat. He visits his friend Obierika and begins to feel revived a bit. Okonkwo’s daughter Ezinma falls ill, but she recovers after Okonkwo gathers leaves for her medicine.
The death of Ogbuefi Ezeudu is announced to the surrounding villages by means of the ekwe, a musical instrument. Okonkwo feels guilty because the last time Ezeudu visited him was to warn him against taking part in Ikemefuna’s death. At Ogbuefi Ezeudu’s large and elaborate funeral, the men beat drums and fire their guns. Tragedy compounds upon itself when Okonkwo’s gun explodes and kills Ogbuefi Ezeudu’s sixteen-year-old son.
Because killing a clansman is a crime against the earth goddess, Okonkwo must take his family into exile for seven years in order to atone. He gathers his most valuable belongings and takes his family to his mother’s natal village, Mbanta. The men from Ogbuefi Ezeudu’s quarter burn Okonkwo’s buildings and kill his animals to cleanse the village of his sin.
Okonkwo’s kinsmen, especially his uncle, Uchendu, receive him warmly. They help him build a new compound of huts and lend him yam seeds to start a farm. Although he is bitterly disappointed at his misfortune, Okonkwo reconciles himself to life in his motherland.
During the second year of Okonkwo’s exile, Obierika brings several bags of cowries (shells used as currency) that he has made by selling Okonkwo’s yams. Obierika plans to continue to do so until Okonkwo returns to the village. Obierika also brings the bad news that Abame, another village, has been destroyed by the white man.
Soon afterward, six missionaries travel to Mbanta. Through an interpreter named Mr. Kiaga, the missionaries’ leader, Mr. Brown, speaks to the villagers. He tells them that their gods are false and that worshipping more than one God is idolatrous. But the villagers do not understand how the Holy Trinity can be accepted as one God. Although his aim is to convert the residents of Umuofia to Christianity, Mr. Brown does not allow his followers to antagonize the clan.
Mr. Brown grows ill and is soon replaced by Reverend James Smith, an intolerant and strict man. The more zealous converts are relieved to be free of Mr. Brown’s policy of restraint. One such convert, Enoch, dares to unmask an egwugwu during the annual ceremony to honor the earth deity, an act equivalent to killing an ancestral spirit. The next day, the egwugwu burn Enoch’s compound and Reverend Smith’s church to the ground.
The District Commissioner is upset by the burning of the church and requests that the leaders of Umuofia meet with him. Once they are gathered, however, the leaders are handcuffed and thrown in jail, where they suffer insults and physical abuse.
After the prisoners are released, the clansmen hold a meeting, during which five court messengers approach and order the clansmen to desist. Expecting his fellow clan members to join him in uprising, Okonkwo kills their leader with his machete. When the crowd allows the other messengers to escape, Okonkwo realizes that his clan is not willing to go to war.
When the District Commissioner arrives at Okonkwo’s compound, he finds that Okonkwo has hanged himself. Obierika and his friends lead the commissioner to the body. Obierika explains that suicide is a grave sin; thus, according to custom, none of Okonkwo’s clansmen may touch his body. The commissioner, who is writing a book about Africa, believes that the story of Okonkwo’s rebellion and death will make for an interesting paragraph or two. He has already chosen the book’s title: The Pacification of the Primitive Tribes of the Lower Niger."
Mightiest,"Max, who narrates this story in the first person, tells the reader that before he met Freak, he didn’t have a brain. This, he says, is “the unvanquished truth.”
Max first meets Freak, or Kevin, at daycare, the year that Max moves in with Grim and Gram, his mother’s parents. Freak uses crutches and calls himself “Robot Man.” One day, Freak leaves daycare and doesn’t return.
Max resumes the story in the summer before eighth grade. Grim, Max’s grandfather, worries that Max is beginning to look like Him, Max’s father. Max tells us he is L.D., learning disabled, and he doesn’t think he has much going on in his brain. One day, Max is in the backyard. He recognizes a woman moving items into a house down the block as Freak’s mom, and then sees Freak himself. Max is curious and he approaches the house. Freak asks the “earthling” (Max) to identify himself. Max runs back to his basement. He emerges later to find Freak trying to retrieve an object stuck high in a tree. Max helps him and they spend the afternoon together. Freak’s mom, who Max knows as “Fair Gwen of Air”, invites Max to dinner. Max learns that Gwen and his mom were friends years ago. 
Max and Freak go the Fourth of July fireworks show by the millpond together. Max hoists Freak onto his shoulders so that Freak can see. When the show ends, Tony D. (known as Blade) and his gang corner Max and Freak. With Freak steering Max by kicking him right or left, they run straight into the millpond, where Max becomes stuck in the mud. Blade and his followers throw rocks at them from the shore. The police arrive and rescue Max and Freak. One of the cops seems to recognize Max as the son of someone he calls “Killer Kane,” and asks if his dad is still in prison. Freak interrupts him and says, “We’re Freak the Mighty, that’s who we are.” 
Freak the Mighty spend the summer going on quests. On these quests, Freak uses words Max doesn’t understand and insists that Max look them up in the dictionary Freak always carries. Max pretends to understand.
One day, Max and Freak walk to the “Medical Research” facility where Freak says they have an Experimental Bionics Unit. Freak tells Max that he visits there every few months to be fitted for a bionic transplant. Max thinks such a procedure will be painful and dangerous, but Freak says that pain is a state of mind and life itself is dangerous.
The two boys embark on a nighttime quest to retrieve a purse that Blade and his gang tossed down a storm drain. The purse is empty except for an ID card with the address of a Loretta Lee on it. The next day, Max and Freak walk to an area of rundown apartment buildings called the Testaments. Loretta and a man named Iggy live at the address, and they both know Max’s father, Kenny Kane. Iggy says that Max is a “ringer” for his dad, Killer Kane. Loretta remembers that Freak is Gwen’s son. Iggy kicks the boys out and they run home.
The school year begins, and Max finds himself in the same class as Freak. Classmates yell slurs at him. Suddenly, Freak climbs onto Max’s shoulders and directs Max to walk around the room. “Freak the Mighty, Freak the Mighty!” he shouts. Soon the whole class is chanting. Freak the Mighty end up in the principal’s office. 
Friday the thirteenth in October comes and it’s a bad one. First, Max’s dad wants Max to write a letter to the parole board on his behalf. Max has a panic attack. Second, a medical emergency sends Freak to the hospital. His insides are growing but his outside isn’t.
As Christmas approaches, Grim tells Max that his dad is out on parole. Freak and Fair Gwen, Max, Grim and Gram spend Christmas Eve together. Freak gives Max a dictionary that he has written, filled with his favorite words. The best gift ever, Max thinks.
After the Christmas Eve festivities, Max’s father sneaks into the basement. He kidnaps Max, and they end up at Loretta and Iggy’s place. Kenny ties up Max in a vacant apartment and swears on a Bible that he did not murder Max’s mother. 
Iggy reports that Freak has sent the cops to look for them. Kenny escapes with Max to an abandoned building where he gags and ties Max up. When Kenny leaves, Loretta appears and works to free Max. No sooner is Max untied, than Kenny returns, and grabs Loretta to choke her. Max tries to stop him, yelling that he saw Kenny kill his mother. Kane lets go of Loretta and grabs Max’s neck. Seconds later, Freak appears with a squirt gun supposedly filled with sulfuric acid, which he sprays at Kenny’s eyes. Max and Freak escape, the cops arrest Kenny and save Loretta. Freak laughs because the squirt gun – filled in fact with soap, vinegar, and curry powder – worked. As Gwen arrives and carries Freak away, he yells, “Freak the Mighty strikes again!” 
The school year continues. Gwen warns Kevin that he has to be “extra careful.” He’s been having trouble breathing. Max awaits his father’s trial and is relieved when Killer Kane pleads guilty because he won’t have to testify. 
Freak, Fair Gwen, Grim, Gram, and Max celebrate Freak’s thirteenth birthday. Suddenly, Freak has a seizure and is rushed to the hospital. 
The doctors make an exception and allow Max to visit when Freak asks for him. Freak tells Max that he won’t be coming home looking the way he looks now, and that he’s having a special operation. He gives Max a gift of a blank book and tells Max to write in it, to tell the story of Freak the Mighty.
When Max arrives back at the hospital the next day, Freak has passed away. The doctor explains that his heart just got too big for his body. 
For a long time, Max does not come out of the basement. When he eventually does, he runs into Loretta Lee, who asks what he’s been doing. When he says, “Nothing,” Loretta tells him, “Nothing is a drag, kid. Think about it.” That night, Max takes out the blank book and starts writing “the unvanquished truth.” He finishes the story and feels good about having written a book. Max thinks maybe he’ll even read a book now."
Americans,"On a lovely day in May, 1868, Christopher Newman, a wealthy American businessman, sits down in the Louvre with an aesthetic headache, having seen too many paintings. A young Parisian copyist, Noémie Nioche, catches his eye, and he agrees to buy the painting she is working on for the extravagant price of 2,000 francs.
Shortly thereafter, Newman recognizes Tom Tristram, an old friend from the Civil War, wandering the gallery. Newman explains that he has made quite a fortune and now, having realized the inanity of seeking competitive revenge on his fellow businessmen, has decided to move to Europe to enjoy his wealth.
Over dinner, Newman admits to the Tristrams that he has come to Europe to find a wife to complete his fortune. Mrs. Tristram suggests Claire de Cintré, the beautiful and widowed daughter of an impossibly aristocratic family, the Bellegardes. Several days later, Newman stops by the Tristram house only to find the visiting Claire, who politely invites him to call on her. When Newman stops by the Bellegarde home, a pleasant young man promises to go get Claire, but is checked by an imposing older figure who claims she is not at home.
Shortly thereafter, M. Nioche, Noémie's father, appears at Newman's hotel with his daughter's heavily varnished and framed picture. When the timid, bankrupt Nioche admits his fear that his beautiful daughter will come to a bad end, Newman offers to let her earn a modest dowry by painting. When he meets Noémie in the Louvre to commission the paintings, however, she tells him bluntly that she cannot paint and will only marry if she can do so very well.
Mrs. Tristram encourages Newman to spend the summer traveling, promising that Claire will wait for his return. Newman spends a wonderful summer exploring ruins, monuments, cathedrals, and the countryside with his usual enthusiasm. On his return to Paris in the fall, Newman calls on Claire and finds her at home with her brother Valentin, the pleasant young man he met on the first visit. Newman is deeply drawn to Claire's presence, her peace, and her intense yet mild eyes.
About a week later, Valentin calls on Newman at home. The two talk late into the night and soon become fast friends. Valentin explains to Newman that Claire was married at eighteen, against her will, to the disagreeable old Count de Cintré. Valentin tried to stop the wedding, but his mother, the Marquise and his brother, Urbain—the imposing older figure who barred Newman's first visit—coveted the Count's pedigree and fortune. When the Count died and his questionable business practices were exposed, Claire was so horrified that she withdrew her claim to his money. The Marquise and Urbain allowed this withdrawal on the condition that Claire obey them completely for ten years on every issue but marriage.
Newman tells Valentin that he would like to marry Claire. Valentin promises to help Newman's cause, out of both friendship and a spirit of mischief. The following day, Newman calls on Claire and finds her alone. He frankly details his love, his assets, and his desire to marry her. Fascinated but hesitant, Claire tells him she has decided not to marry, but agrees to get to know him if he promises not to speak of marriage for six months.
Delighted by Newman's success, Valentin arranges an audience with the heads of the family—the forbidding Marquise and Urbain—later that week. On the appointed evening, after some painful small talk, Newman horrifies the assembled company with a long and candid speech about his poor adolescence and the makings of his fortune. When the others have left for a ball, Newman bluntly tells the Marquise that he would like to marry her daughter. After inquiring with equal frankness about his wealth, the Marquise grudgingly agrees to consider his proposal.
Several days later, M. Nioche unexpectedly appears at Newman's hotel room, clearly worried about Noémie's antics. Newman decides to visit Noémie at the Louvre to discern the trouble. He encounters Valentin en route and brings him along. Valentin, completely charmed by Noémie and her ruthless, sublime ambition, resolves to pursue her. Shortly thereafter, Newman receives an invitation to dinner at the Bellegarde house. After dinner, Urbain confirms that the family has decided to accept Newman as a candidate for Claire's hand.
Over the next six weeks Newman comes often to the Bellegarde house, more than content to haunt Claire's rooms and attend her parties. One afternoon as he awaits Claire, Newman is approached by Mrs. Bread, the Bellegardes' old English maid, who secretly encourages him in his courtship. Meanwhile, the Bellegardes' long-lost cousin Lord Deepmere arrives in Paris.
Upon the expiration of the six-month period of silence about marriage, Newman proposes to Claire again, and she accepts. The next day, Mrs. Bread warns Newman to lose no time in getting married. The Marquise is evidently displeased by the engagement, but agrees to throw an engagement ball. The following few days are the happiest in Newman's life, as he sees Claire every day, exchanging longing glances and tender words. Meanwhile, the Marquise and Urbain are away, taking Deepmere on a tour of Paris.
On the night of the Bellegarde ball, Newman suffers endless introductions gladly and feels elated. He surprises first the Marquis and then Claire in heated discussions with Lord Deepmere, but thinks little of it. Afterwards, he and Claire exchange declarations of happiness.
Shortly thereafter, Newman attends a performance of the opera Don Giovanni, and sees that several of his acquaintances are also there. During the second act, Valentin and Stanislas Kapp, who have both been sitting in Noémie's box, exchange insults and agree to a duel as a point of honor. Noémie is thrilled, knowing that being dueled over will do wonders for her social standing. Against Newman's protests, Valentin leaves for the duel, which is held just over the Swiss border.
The next morning, Newman arrives at the Bellegardes' to find Claire's carriage packed. In great distress, Claire confesses that she can no longer marry him. The Marquise and Urbain admit that they have interfered, unable to accept the idea that a commercial person should marry into their family. Newman visits Mrs. Tristram, who guesses that the Bellegardes want Claire to marry the rich Lord Deepmere instead, though the honest Deepmere ruined things by telling Claire everything at the ball. Returning home to a note that Valentin has been mortally wounded in the duel, Newman packs his bags and heads for the Swiss border.
Newman arrives in Geneva to find Valentin near death. When Newman reluctantly recounts the broken engagement with Claire, Valentin formally apologizes for his family and tells Newman to ask Mrs. Bread about a skeleton in the Bellegarde family closet that Newman can use to get revenge. Newman attends Valentin's funeral, but cannot bear to watch the actual burial and leaves. Three days later, he calls on Claire at the family château in Fleurières, hoping to extract a rational justification for her rejection. But she hides behind dark hints of a curse on the family, ruing her own vain attempts at happiness and declaring her intention to become a Carmelite nun.
Newman threatens the Bellegardes with his superficial knowledge of their secret, but they refuse to budge. That night, Newman secretly meets Mrs. Bread, who tells him the full secret—the Marquise and Urbain killed the Marquis, Claire's father, at the family's country home because he opposed Claire's first marriage to the Comte de Cintré. Mrs. Bread gives Newman a secret testament to these circumstances that the Marquis wrote just before he died.
The next week in Paris, Mrs. Bread comes to work for Newman as his housekeeper. Newman goes to mass at the Carmelite convent, but, horrified by the nuns' joyless chanting, he leaves. After the service, he confronts the Marquise and Urbain with the details of their crime and a copy of the Marquis' letter. The Bellegardes are clearly stunned, but regain their composure and leave. The next morning, Urbain visits Newman to ask his price for destroying the note. Newman wants Claire, but Urbain refuses to give her. The two part in stalemate.
Newman decides to ruin the Bellegardes by telling all their friends about the murder. But when Newman calls on a rich Duchess, the first person he intends to tell, he is overwhelmed by the folly of his errand. Instead, he leaves for London to think. One day in Hyde Park, Newman see Noémie on Lord Deepmere's arm, attended by her miserable father.
After several months in London, Newman returns to the States. He makes it to San Francisco before the weight of his unfinished business in France becomes unbearable. Returning to Paris, Newman walks to Claire's convent and finds only a high, blank wall. Realizing that Claire is completely lost to him, Newman destroys the Marquis' incriminatory note in Mrs. Tristram's fireplace and packs his bags for America."
Here,"There There is a collection of stories about different people who are all traveling to the Big Oakland Powwow in California. Each chapter follows a different character, describing their history and explaining why they are going to the powwow. Each of the characters is Native American, but not all of them embrace their heritage.
Tony Loneman, twenty-one years old, was born with fetal alcohol syndrome. While he grew up believing he was not intelligent, he has natural street smarts. When he looks in the mirror, Tony sees what he calls “the Drome”: the facial features associated with fetal alcohol syndrome. Tony lives with his grandmother and has been selling drugs since he was thirteen. His drug supplier, Octavio, shows him a 3-D printed gun and tells him that they are going to rob the Big Oakland Powwow at the Oakland Coliseum.
Dene Oxendene lives in Oakland and is a young, motivated artist. He obtains a grant to make a storytelling documentary in which Native people share their perspectives on living in Oakland. He inherited both his camera and his interest in moviemaking from his late uncle. Dene plans to set up a storytelling booth at the powwow.
Opal Viola Victoria Bear Shield and her sister, Jacquie Red Feather, were children when their mother took them to Alcatraz Island in 1970 as part of Native American protests. Opal mostly spent time with her mother there, while Jacquie spent time with a group of teenagers. Before leaving the island, Jacquie was raped by another teen named Harvey. She became pregnant and put the baby girl up for adoption. When Opal and Jacquie’s mother died, they entered the foster care system. Jacquie had another daughter, Jamie, who went on to have three boys: Orvil, Loother, and Lony. Jamie was a heroin addict and eventually killed herself. Since Jacquie was still battling alcohol addiction, Opal adopted Jacquie’s three grandsons. While raising the boys, Opal has taught them that they are not to engage in any Native activities. 
Orvil Red Feather, the oldest of Jacquie’s grandsons, watches footage of powwows on the internet. Feeling a connection to the dancers, he finds a set of Native regalia in Opal’s closet and practices dancing. He takes his brothers to the Big Oakland Powwow without telling Opal, hoping that he can win prize money by dancing. Opal goes to the powwow to watch, careful not to let the boys know that she is attending.
Jacquie Red Feather lives in New Mexico, where she works as an addiction counselor but still struggles with alcoholism herself. She has never actually met her grandsons. When she runs into Harvey at an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, she confronts him about their past. Harvey has just learned that he has a son in Oakland named Edwin, and Jacquie tells him that they have a daughter, the one she put up for adoption. Jacquie agrees to ride with Harvey to Oakland, even though she has a difficult time forgiving him.
Harvey’s son, Edwin Black, still lives with his mother, even though he is in his thirties. His mother helps him get a paid internship at the Indian Center where he helps organize the Big Oakland Powwow. Her boyfriend, Bill Davis, works as part of the maintenance crew for the Oakland Coliseum, where the powwow will be held.
Blue is Jacquie’s first daughter, who was put up for adoption. She was raised in Oakland but later moved to Oklahoma. Stuck in an abusive marriage, Blue escaped Oklahoma and moved back to Oakland. She has been working at the Indian Center in Oakland for a year. She and Edwin plan the Big Oakland Powwow.
Calvin Johnson lives with his sister in Oakland. He and his brother Charles work for Octavio, Tony’s supplier, selling drugs. Calvin owes Octavio money and has been avoiding him. Charles and his crime partner, Carlos, take Calvin to Octavio to sort out the issue. Octavio tells the group that they are going to rob the Big Oakland Powwow with 3-D printed guns that can get through the security checkpoint. Because Calvin works at the Indian Center, he is afraid that he will be recognized.
Thomas Frank goes to the powwow to drum and sing for the dancers. He has recently been fired from the Indian Center, but drumming gives him a sense of belonging.
On the day of the powwow, Blue and Edwin arrive early to set up the field. Dene Oxendene sets up his storytelling booth, hoping to film interviews with people and ask what the powwow experience means to them. Harvey is the powwow emcee, and Jacquie sits with him in the tent with all of the sound equipment. Edwin and Blue walk over and meet Harvey and Jacquie. Harvey embraces Edwin, recognizing that he is his son. Blue thinks that Jacquie might be her mother and is in shock (she does not realize that Harvey is her father). Jacquie sees Orvil’s name on the list of men who will be dancing.
Orvil and his brothers, Loother and Lony, ride their bikes to the powwow. Orvil puts on the regalia that he took from Opal’s closet and dances out during the Grand Entry. Up in the stands, Opal watches his performance.
Entering the Coliseum with their 3-D printed guns, Calvin, Octavio, Charles, Carlos, and Tony approach the table where Edwin and Blue are sitting. Tony is supposed to do the actual holdup while the others keep watch, but he changes his mind. In his place, Octavio approaches the table and points his gun at Edwin and Blue, demanding the money. After Octavio has the money (in the form of Visa gift cards), Charles and Carlos try to rob him. Octavio shoots at Charles but then is killed by Carlos. Calvin dies in the crossfire. Tony, seeing that many innocent people are also caught in the crossfire, shoots Carlos and then tackles Charles. Tony kills Charles but is hit many times and also dies. 
Thomas, Orvil, and Edwin are among the people caught in the crossfire. Thomas dies. Blue takes Edwin to the hospital while Opal, Harvey, and Jacquie take Orvil to the hospital.  Both boys are admitted at the emergency room, but their fate is unclear."
Troublesome,"The four Garcia sisters, Carla, Sandra, Yolanda and Sofia, enjoyed a fairly sheltered and luxurious childhood in the Dominican Republic. They often received exciting presents from FAO Schwarz in the United States. Carla remembers an iron bank representing Mary ascending to heaven, which she gave to one of the family's maids, who was later dismissed for stealing the bank. Yolanda played with her boy cousin and showed him her genitals in exchange for a Human Body doll and modeling clay. She also stole a newborn kitten from its mother and put it inside a drum that she played until she grew bored and threw the kitten outside, where it sadly hobbled away. The mother cat appeared to her in nightmares and haunted her. Sandra wanted to be an artist but her irrepressible spirit got her in trouble and she was thrown out of art class. She later came upon a naked chained insane sculptor who scared her as she fell and broke her arm. She lost her artistic vision and settled for being the sculptor's muse when she realized he had used her face in a representation of the Virgin Mary.
When their father, Carlos, got in trouble with the secret police for agitating against the military dictatorship, the family enlisted the help of a CIA operative, Vic, to get them out of the country. They fled to New York City, where they had trouble adjusting culturally and materially to the new situation. Laura, the sisters' mother, came from a wealthy and influential family in the Dominican Republic and did not like having to become a middle class nobody in the United States. She found comfort through supporting her daughters' endeavors, such as Yolanda's poetry and Sofia's defiance of her father's overprotective nature.
Dr. Fanning helped Carlos get a medical fellowship, and offered to take the family out for a celebratory dinner once they had settled in the United States. Laura wanted to make a good impression and pressured the girls to behave themselves and not ask for any special treats. After Sandra saw Mrs. Fanning kiss her father in the restroom, she insisted that Dr. Fanning buy her a flamenco doll. Carla had trouble fitting in to American school settings, and was harassed by abusive and prejudiced schoolboys. She also was nearly molested by a perverted exhibitionist in a car. Yolanda began to write in English and found a way to express her own voice, though she started off by imitating Walt Whitman. Her father criticized her insubordination, which Yolanda perceived to be intellectual independence. Sofia was sent to the Dominican Republic as a punishment for using marijuana, though she ended up getting into more trouble by spending time without a chaperone with her illegitimate cousin, Manuel.
In college, Yolanda had trouble relating to men, since she was turned off by the vocabulary men use to describe sex. Though she was attracted to a boy, Rudy, she would not sleep with him and he accused her of being frigid. She was hurt by this but later realized that he was just a jerk. She later married a man she thought she loved, John, though at a certain point they had problems communicating. Like Rudy, he did not understand her Dominican cultural heritage, and could not appreciate the Spanish language. When Yolanda stopped trusting and loving John, she could not understand the words he used, and only heard ""babble, babble."" She had a mental breakdown at her parents' house, in which she could only quote and misquote bits of things she had read and heard throughout her life. She spent time in a mental hospital until she recovered. Her sister Sandra also had a mental breakdown, in which she thought she was regressing through evolution, and would eventually cease to be human.
After Sandra is released from the hospital, Sofia planned to reconcile with her father during a birthday party. She broke tradition, in that the daughters would usually come home for their father's birthday, but she hosts the party at her house to show off her German husband and two blond children. She and her father had fought when he accused her of sleeping around during a trip to Colombia, where she met her husband, Otto. She ran away from home to assert her independence, and later married Otto. Though the party was going well, Sofia was hurt that her father did not express more affection toward her. She humiliated him with a seductive kiss in the ear as part of a party game. Yolanda returned to the Dominican Republic, possibly for good, to embrace her extended family and cultural roots. Her family thought she was crazy for driving into the countryside by herself, but she ignored them. She got lost looking for fresh guavas, and then got a flat tire. When approached by two men, she panicked and pretended not to speak any Spanish. Yolanda felt more comfortable in her English speaking American identity than with the Dominican side of her personality."
Advocates,"Lawyer Bryan Stevenson gives a first-person account of his decades helping marginalized Americans who have been unfairly and harshly punished by the U.S. criminal justice system, which disproportionately targets people of color and poor people. At the heart of Just Mercy is the story of Walter McMillian, a Black man who was framed for the murder of a girl named Ronda Morrison, convicted, and sent to death row. 
Stevenson alternates chapters about Walter with his personal reflections on our country’s history with racial disparity and issues around incarceration. Stevenson highlights other groups of vulnerable people who have been victimized by the criminal justice system and shares the stories of the prisoners he has helped over the years. The book also follows the growth of Stevenson’s nonprofit law project, the Alabama-based Equal Justice Initiative (EJI), through its expansion from focusing on death row prisoners to helping people sentenced to life without parole. Stevenson chronicles how EJI becomes a significant force in criminal justice reform.
In 1983 as a law student, Stevenson discovers his life’s passion when he interns with the Georgia-based Southern Prisoners Defense Committee and meets his first death row prisoner. After graduation Stevenson accepts a job with the organization to represent poor prisoners, including those in Alabama who lack any public defender. He meets Walter McMillian on Alabama’s death row. Walter owns a successful business but also transgresses racial boundaries when he has an affair with a white woman. Soon after the affair becomes public, the woman’s friend, Ralph Myers, accuses Walter of committing the unsolved murder of Ronda Morrison, which has outraged the community. Law enforcement, including a racist sheriff and the district attorney, eagerly pounces on this accusation, overlooking Walter’s alibi and a lack of evidence. Instead, they actively force Ralph to stick with his story even when he tries to recant. They coerce other false witness testimonies, and—as revealed years later—actively suppress evidence.
After Stevenson and the team at EJI unsuccessfully appeal Walter’s conviction, they launch their own investigation of the crime and uncover new evidence. They find witnesses who can prove the witnesses against Walter lied as well as financial records that indicate that one of these witnesses was paid to give false testimony. Stevenson and his team also petition for and receive all records from Walter’s trial. However, their big break comes when they receive a phone call from Ralph, who now wants to make amends. Ralph admits to lying about Walter and says he was threatened by law enforcement. Stevenson wins a hearing for Walter where he can present his new evidence: Ralph’s testimony, which is confirmed by health care workers and other inmates, as well as recordings of the law enforcement team threatening Ralph if he doesn’t frame Walter. 
While the judge refuses to grant Walter relief, Stevenson continues the appeal process through the Alabama courts. The district attorney asks outside agents to investigate the murder for which Walter was convicted, and the investigators determine that Walter had nothing to do with the crime. Six weeks later, the court invalidates Walter’s conviction. Stevenson and the State file a joint motion to dismiss the charges, and Walter is set free.
Throughout the process, Stevenson and Walter become close friends, and Stevenson helps Walter upon his release, including filing a civil suit on his behalf and offering him a place to stay. Walter works with Stevenson to share his story, giving interviews and speaking at legal conferences, and Walter is even featured in a documentary. Unfortunately, Walter is diagnosed with advancing dementia and is forced to rely on family and eventually a nursing facility for his care. He dies in 2013. Stevenson gives a eulogy at his funeral and shares all he learned from Walter, particularly that we must extend mercy to everyone, even those who have not earned it.
Interspersed with chapters chronicling Walter’s narrative are stories of Stevenson’s other clients and work. His closeness with these prisoners and their horrifying circumstances makes Stevenson more determined to help and causes him to reflect on abstract issues that nevertheless imbue the criminal justice system, like humanity and mercy. Stevenson focuses on several categories of vulnerable people who become trapped in the system, including mentally ill prisoners, disabled prisoners, and poor women who give birth to stillborn babies. 
Stevenson and his team at EJI also become increasingly focused on juvenile offenders who are sometimes tried as adults despite their young age. These offenders may be given de facto death sentences by being sentenced to life without parole and face perilous circumstances when they are housed in adult prisons. Stevenson illustrates how these prisoners retain their own humanity while being forced to live under inhumane conditions. He also discusses some of the qualities common among these types of prisoners: They are generally poor and disproportionately people of color, and most of them lack adequate legal counsel. The juveniles have horrific backgrounds of abuse and neglect.
Stevenson and his team at EJI also work to change the legal system to offer more protection to marginalized people. Several of his cases end up before the U.S. Supreme Court, and he succeeds in winning rulings that ban as unconstitutional the conviction of children to life without parole and the execution of people deemed incompetent from dementia or neurological disease. EJI works to raise public awareness of issues surrounding unfair incarceration, produces groundbreaking reports on racial issues, and sets up programs to help formerly incarcerated people adjust to life on the outside.
Stevenson also reflects on the issues that surround the criminal justice system. His time spent with prisoners awaiting their execution makes him realize how inhumane it is to prepare another human to die. After decades of work, when Stevenson fails to prevent the execution of a man who suffers from an intellectual disability, he momentarily feels unable to continue his work. However, he realizes that he cannot help but be broken by his experiences and comes to understand that it is his own brokenness that allows him to more fully understand the need for mercy and to bring compassion to others. The book ends with Stevenson’s renewed commitment to helping others."
Owning,"The dramatic setting of A Room of One's Own is that Woolf has been invited to lecture on the topic of Women and Fiction. She advances the thesis that ""a woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction."" Her essay is constructed as a partly-fictionalized narrative of the thinking that led her to adopt this thesis. She dramatizes that mental process in the character of an imaginary narrator (""call me Mary Beton, Mary Seton, Mary Carmichael or by any name you please—it is not a matter of any importance"") who is in her same position, wrestling with the same topic.
The narrator begins her investigation at Oxbridge College, where she reflects on the different educational experiences available to men and women as well as on more material differences in their lives. She then spends a day in the British Library perusing the scholarship on women, all of which has been written by men and all of which has been written in anger. Turning to history, she finds so little data about the everyday lives of women that she decides to reconstruct their existence imaginatively. The figure of Judith Shakespeare is generated as an example of the tragic fate a highly intelligent woman would have met with under those circumstances. In light of this background, she considers the achievements of the major women novelists of the nineteenth century and reflects on the importance of tradition to an aspiring writer. A survey of the current state of literature follows, conducted through a reading of the first novel of one of the narrator's contemporaries. Woolf closes the essay with an exhortation to her audience of women to take up the tradition that has been so hardly bequeathed to them, and to increase the endowment for their own daughters."
Discouraging,"The protagonist, who is named Tim O’Brien, begins by describing an event that occurred in the middle of his Vietnam experience. “The Things They Carried” catalogs the variety of things his fellow soldiers in the Alpha Company brought on their missions. Several of these things are intangible, including guilt and fear, while others are specific physical objects, including matches, morphine, M-16 rifles, and M&M’s candy.
Throughout the collection, the same characters reappear in various stories. The first member of the Alpha Company to die is Ted Lavender, a “grunt,” or low-ranking soldier, who deals with his anxiety about the war by taking tranquilizers and smoking marijuana. Lavender is shot in the head on his way back from going to the bathroom, and his superior, Lieutenant Jimmy Cross, blames himself for the tragedy. When Lavender is shot, Cross is distracting himself with thoughts of Martha, a college crush. It is revealed in “Love” that Cross’s feelings for Martha, whom he dated once before leaving for Vietnam, were never reciprocated, and that even twenty years after the war, his guilt over Lavender’s death remains.
In “On the Rainy River,” the narrator, O’Brien, explains the series of events that led him to Vietnam in the first place. He receives his draft notice in June of 1968, and his feelings of confusion drive him north to the Canadian border, which he contemplates crossing so that he will not be forced to fight in a war in which he doesn’t believe. Sitting in a rowboat with the proprietor of the Tip Top Lodge, where he stays, O’Brien decides that his guilt about avoiding the war and fear of disappointing his family are more important than his political convictions. He soon leaves, going first back home to Worthington, Minnesota and later to Vietnam.
In addition to Ted Lavender, a few other members of the Alpha Company are killed during their mission overseas, including Curt Lemon, who is killed when he steps on a rigged mortar round. Though O’Brien is not close to Lemon, in “The Dentist,” he tells a story of how Lemon, who faints before a routine checkup with an army-issued dentist, tries to save face by insisting that a perfectly good tooth be pulled. Lee Strunk, another member of the company, dies from injuries he sustains by stepping on a landmine. In “Friends,” O’Brien remembers that before Strunk was fatally hurt, Strunk and Dave Jensen had made a pact that if either man were irreparably harmed, the other man would see that he was quickly killed. However, when Strunk is actually hurt, he begs Jensen to spare him, and Jensen complies. Instead of being upset by the news of his friend’s swift death en route to treatment, Jensen is relieved.
The death that receives the most attention in The Things They Carried is that of Kiowa, a much-loved member of the Alpha Company and one of O’Brien’s closest friends. In “Speaking of Courage,” the story of Kiowa’s death is relayed in retrospect through the memory of Norman Bowker, years after the war. As Bowker drives around a lake in his Iowa hometown, he thinks that he failed to save Kiowa, who was killed when a mortar round hit and caused him to sink headfirst into a marshy field. O’Brien realizes that he has dealt with his guilt over Kiowa’s death differently than Norman Bowker in “Notes.” Just before the end of the war, O’Brien receives a long letter from Bowker that says he hasn’t found a way to make life meaningful after the war. O’Brien resolves to tell Bowker’s story, and the story of Kiowa’s death, in order to negotiate his own feelings of guilt and hollowness.
Like “Love” and “Notes,” several of O’Brien’s stories are told from a perspective twenty years after the Vietnam War, when he is a forty-three-year-old writer living in Massachusetts. Exposure to the guilt of old friends like Jimmy Cross and Norman Bowker prompts him to write stories in order to understand what they were going through. But two stories, “The Man I Killed” and “Ambush,” are written so that O’Brien can confront his own guilt over killing a man with a grenade outside the village of My Khe. In “The Man I Killed,” O’Brien imagines the life of his victim, from his childhood to the way things would have turned out for him had O’Brien not spotted him on a path and thrown a grenade at his feet. In “Ambush,” O’Brien imagines how he might relay the story of the man he killed to his nine-year-old daughter, Kathleen. In this second story, O’Brien provides more details of the actual killing—including the sound of the grenade and his own feelings—and explains that even well after the fact, he hasn’t finished sorting out the experience.
In the last story, “The Lives of the Dead,” O’Brien gives another twist to his contention that stories have the power to save people. In the stories of Curt Lemon and Kiowa, O’Brien explains that his imagination allowed him to grapple successfully with his guilt and confusion over the death of his fourth-grade first love, Linda."
Handed,"Offred is a Handmaid in the Republic of Gilead, a totalitarian and theocratic state that has replaced the United States of America. Because of dangerously low reproduction rates, Handmaids are assigned to bear children for elite couples that have trouble conceiving. Offred serves the Commander and his wife, Serena Joy, a former gospel singer and advocate for “traditional values.” Offred is not the narrator’s real name—Handmaid names consist of the word “of” followed by the name of the Handmaid’s Commander. Every month, when Offred is at the right point in her menstrual cycle, she must have ritualized sex with the Commander while Serena sits behind her, holding her hands. Offred’s freedom, like the freedom of all women, is completely restricted. She can leave the house only on shopping trips, the door to her room cannot be completely shut, and the Eyes, Gilead’s secret police force, watch her every public move.
As Offred tells the story of her daily life, she frequently slips into flashbacks, from which the reader can reconstruct the events leading up to the beginning of the novel. In the old world, before Gilead, Offred had an affair with Luke, a married man. Luke divorced his wife and married Offred, and they had a child together. Offred’s mother was a single mother and feminist activist. Offred’s best friend, Moira, was fiercely independent. The architects of Gilead began their rise to power in an age of readily available pornography, prostitution, and violence against women—when pollution and chemical spills led to declining fertility rates. Using the military, they assassinated the president and members of Congress and launched a coup, claiming that they were taking power temporarily. They cracked down on women’s rights, forbidding women to hold property or jobs. Offred and Luke took their daughter and attempted to flee across the border into Canada, but they were caught and separated from one another, and Offred has seen neither her husband nor her daughter since.
After her capture, Offred’s marriage was voided (because Luke had been divorced), and she was sent to the Rachel and Leah Re-education Center, called the Red Center by its inhabitants. At the center, women were indoctrinated into Gilead’s ideology in preparation for becoming Handmaids. Aunt Lydia supervised the women, giving speeches extolling Gilead’s beliefs that women should be subservient to men and solely concerned with bearing children. Aunt Lydia also argued that such a social order ultimately offers women more respect and safety than the old, pre-Gilead society offered them. Moira is brought to the Red Center, but she escapes, and Offred does not know what becomes of her.
Once Offred is assigned to the Commander’s house, her life settles into a restrictive routine. She takes shopping trips with Ofglen, another Handmaid, and they visit the Wall outside what used to be Harvard University, where the bodies of rebels hang. She must visit the doctor frequently to be checked for disease and other complications, and she must endure the “Ceremony,” in which the Commander reads to the household from the Bible, then goes to the bedroom, where Serena and Offred wait for him, and has sex with Offred.
The first break from her routine occurs when she visits the doctor and he offers to have sex with her to get her pregnant, suggesting that her Commander is probably infertile. She refuses. The doctor makes her uneasy, but his proposition is too risky—she could be sent away if caught. After a Ceremony, the Commander sends his gardener and chauffeur, Nick, to ask Offred to come see him in his study the following night. She begins visiting him regularly. They play Scrabble (which is forbidden, since women are not allowed to read), and he lets her look at old magazines like Vogue. At the end of these secret meetings, he asks her to kiss him.
During one of their shopping trips, Ofglen reveals to Offred that she is a member of “Mayday,” an underground organization dedicated to overthrowing Gilead. Meanwhile, Offred begins to find that the Ceremony feels different and less impersonal now that she knows the Commander. Their nighttime conversations begin to touch on the new order that the Commander and his fellow leaders have created in Gilead. When Offred admits how unhappy she is, the Commander remarks, “[Y]ou can’t make an omelette without breaking eggs.”
After some time has gone by without Offred becoming pregnant, Serena suggests that Offred have sex with Nick secretly and pass the child off as the Commander’s. Serena promises to bring Offred a picture of her daughter if she sleeps with Nick, and Offred realizes with horror that Serena has always known where her daughter was. The same night that Offred is to sleep with Nick, the Commander secretly takes her out to a club called Jezebel’s, where the Commanders mingle with prostitutes. Offred sees Moira working there. The two women meet in a bathroom, and Offred learns that Moira was captured just before she crossed the border. She chose life in Jezebel’s over being sent to the Colonies, where most political prisoners and others who pose a threat to Gilead are sent. After that night at Jezebel’s, Offred says, she never sees Moira again. The Commander takes Offred upstairs after a few hours, and they have sex in what used to be a hotel room. She tries to feign passion.
Soon after Offred returns from Jezebel’s, late at night, Serena arrives and tells Offred to go to Nick’s room. Offred and Nick have sex. Soon they begin to sleep together frequently, without anyone’s knowledge. Offred becomes caught up in the affair and ignores Ofglen’s requests that she gather information from the Commander for Mayday. One day, all the Handmaids take part in a group execution of a supposed rapist, supervised by Aunt Lydia. Ofglen strikes the first blow. Later, she tells Offred that the so-called rapist was a member of Mayday and that she hit him to put him out of his misery.
Shortly thereafter, Offred goes out shopping, and a new Ofglen meets her. This new woman is not part of Mayday, and she tells Offred that the old Ofglen hanged herself when she saw the secret police coming for her. At home, Serena has found out about Offred’s trip to Jezebel’s, and she sends her to her room, promising punishment. Offred waits there, and she sees a black van from the Eyes approach. Then Nick comes in and tells her that the Eyes are really Mayday members who have come to save her. Offred leaves with them, over the Commander’s futile objections, on her way either to prison or to freedom—she does not know which.
The novel closes with an epilogue from 2195, after Gilead has fallen, written in the form of a lecture given by Professor Pieixoto. He explains the formation and customs of Gilead in objective, analytical language. He discusses the significance of Offred’s story, which has been found on cassette tapes in Bangor, Maine. Pieixoto suggests that Nick arranged Offred’s escape but that her fate after that is unknown. She could have escaped to Canada or England, or she could have been recaptured."
Community,"The Giver is written from the point of view of Jonas, an eleven-year-old boy living in a futuristic society that has eliminated all pain, fear, war, and hatred. There is no prejudice, since everyone looks and acts basically the same, and there is very little competition. Everyone is unfailingly polite. The society has also eliminated choice: at age twelve every member of the community is assigned a job based on his or her abilities and interests. Citizens can apply for and be assigned compatible spouses, and each couple is assigned exactly two children each. The children are born to Birthmothers, who never see them, and spend their first year in a Nurturing Center with other babies, or “newchildren,” born that year. When their children are grown, family units dissolve and adults live together with Childless Adults until they are too old to function in the society. Then they spend their last years being cared for in the House of the Old until they are finally “released” from the society. In the community, release is death, but it is never described that way; most people think that after release, flawed newchildren and joyful elderly people are welcomed into the vast expanse of Elsewhere that surrounds the communities. Citizens who break rules or fail to adapt properly to the society’s codes of behavior are also released, though in their cases it is an occasion of great shame. Everything is planned and organized so that life is as convenient and pleasant as possible.
Jonas lives with his father, a Nurturer of new children, his mother, who works at the Department of Justice, and his seven-year-old sister Lily. At the beginning of the novel, he is apprehensive about the upcoming Ceremony of Twelve, when he will be given his official Assignment as a new adult member of the community. He does not have a distinct career preference, although he enjoys volunteering at a variety of different jobs. Though he is a well-behaved citizen and a good student, Jonas is different: he has pale eyes, while most people in his community have dark eyes, and he has unusual powers of perception. Sometimes objects “change” when he looks at them. He does not know it yet, but he alone in his community can perceive flashes of color; for everyone else, the world is as devoid of color as it is of pain, hunger, and inconvenience.
At the Ceremony of Twelve, Jonas is given the highly honored Assignment of Receiver of Memory. The Receiver is the sole keeper of the community’s collective memory. When the community went over to Sameness—its painless, warless, and mostly emotionless state of tranquility and harmony—it abandoned all memories of pain, war, and emotion, but the memories cannot disappear totally. Someone must keep them so that the community can avoid making the mistakes of the past, even though no one but the Receiver can bear the pain. Jonas receives the memories of the past, good and bad, from the current Receiver, a wise old man who tells Jonas to call him the Giver.
The Giver transmits memories by placing his hands on Jonas’s bare back. The first memory he receives is of an exhilarating sled ride. As Jonas receives memories from the Giver—memories of pleasure and pain, of bright colors and extreme cold and warm sun, of excitement and terror and hunger and love—he realizes how bland and empty life in his community really is. The memories make Jonas’s life richer and more meaningful, and he wishes that he could give that richness and meaning to the people he loves. But in exchange for their peaceful existence, the people of Jonas’s community have lost the capacity to love him back or to feel deep passion about anything. Since they have never experienced real suffering, they also cannot appreciate the real joy of life, and the life of individual people seems less precious to them. In addition, no one in Jonas’s community has ever made a choice of his or her own. Jonas grows more and more frustrated with the members of his community, and the Giver, who has felt the same way for many years, encourages him. The two grow very close, like a grandfather and a grandchild might have in the days before Sameness, when family members stayed in contact long after their children were grown.
Meanwhile, Jonas is helping his family take care of a problem newchild, Gabriel, who has trouble sleeping through the night at the Nurturing Center. Jonas helps the child to sleep by transmitting soothing memories to him every night, and he begins to develop a relationship with Gabriel that mirrors the family relationships he has experienced through the memories. When Gabriel is in danger of being released, the Giver reveals to Jonas that release is the same as death. Jonas’s rage and horror at this revelation inspire the Giver to help Jonas devise a plan to change things in the community forever. The Giver tells Jonas about the girl who had been designated the new Receiver ten years before. She had been the Giver’s own daughter, but the sadness of some of the memories had been too much for her and she had asked to be released. When she died, all of the memories she had accumulated were released into the community, and the community members could not handle the sudden influx of emotion and sensation. The Giver and Jonas plan for Jonas to escape the community and to actually enter Elsewhere. Once he has done that, his larger supply of memories will disperse, and the Giver will help the community to come to terms with the new feelings and thoughts, changing the society forever.
However, Jonas is forced to leave earlier than planned when his father tells him that Gabriel will be released the next day. Desperate to save Gabriel, Jonas steals his father’s bicycle and a supply of food and sets off for Elsewhere. Gradually, he enters a landscape full of color, animals, and changing weather, but also hunger, danger, and exhaustion. Avoiding search planes, Jonas and Gabriel travel for a long time until heavy snow makes bike travel impossible. Half-frozen, but comforting Gabriel with memories of sunshine and friendship, Jonas mounts a high hill. There he finds a sled—the sled from his first transmitted memory—waiting for him at the top. Jonas and Gabriel experience a glorious downhill ride on the sled. Ahead of them, they see—or think they see—the twinkling lights of a friendly village at Christmas, and they hear music. Jonas is sure that someone is waiting for them there."
Acquiesce,"Five-year-old Luong Ung is the second youngest child in a large and prosperous family, and she lives a happy life in Phnom Penh. In April 1975, her world is abruptly upended when trucks of soldiers roll into the city, greeted by cheers from many of its residents. The Ung family hastily packs to leave, finding nothing to celebrate in the arrival of the destructive force. The soldiers are Khmer Rouge, a communist group under the leadership of Pol Pot, and they have won the civil war raging in Cambodia. They announce that the Americans are coming to bomb the city and insist everyone must evacuate. Leaving most of their belongings behind, the Ungs climb into their truck and join the mass exodus. This is the beginning of a multiyear ordeal under the cruel Khmer Rouge regime, which will claim the lives of four of the family’s members. 
The family drives, then walks, to Bat Deng, Ma’s home village, where her brothers live. They are not safe there, however, and move again several times before finding a village remote enough to protect their identity. Conditions in Ro Leap are difficult and made worse by the Khmer Rouge’s policies, which are designed to establish their ""ideal nation"", Democratic Kampuchea. The Ungs, along with most others in the village, are soon starving. Forced to labor endless hours with insufficient rations, the Ungs do whatever it takes to survive. For example, Kim, the youngest Ung brother, endures beatings in the house of the village chief to acquire extra food.  
As the state’s demands increase, the family’s situation becomes increasingly precarious. Like many in Cambodia, starvation haunts their every step. The parents arrange a marriage for their second son, Khouy. This protects him from conscription, but both he and Meng, the oldest son, are sent to a work camp. Several months later, the family’s oldest daughter, Keav, is also sent to a work camp. She becomes mortally ill and dies before Ma and Pa can travel to care for her. Before the family can mourn, the Khmer Rouge take Pa to one of the infamous Killing Fields, where he is likely executed. With the death of Pa, Luong loses her emotional anchor, and the family its best protector. 
Kim takes over as head of the family and risks his life stealing corn from a nearby field. After he heals from the Khmer Rouge’s brutal beating, Ma decides that he, Chou, and Luong must leave in order to survive. They don't want to, but they acquiesce, although Chou and Luong stay together against Ma’s instructions. The girls go to a work camp for orphans, and soon Luong is sent to a camp for stronger children, where she is trained as a soldier. She visits Ma once and is horrified to see how frail Geak, the youngest Ung child, is. Later, Luong falls ill and is thrilled to meet her family at the local infirmary. They spend nearly a week together, laughing and caring for one another, before overcrowding drives them apart again. This is the last time they see Ma. 
Back at the camp, Luong has a terrible premonition and sneaks out to return to Ro Leap. When she arrives, a neighbor tells her that soldiers took Ma and Geak away. Traumatized, Luong stumbles back to the camp, and she never remembers what happens in the three days that follow. She pours her grief into her training, savagely attacking dummies that she imagines are Khmer Rouge soldiers. When the Vietnamese invade Cambodia, she takes the opportunity to escape and runs in search of Chou. She finds Chou and their brother Kim, and the three head to a refugee camp. Without parents, they struggle to survive, until a foster family takes them in. Their first foster family is cruel but their second is more welcoming. A surprise attack by the Khmer Rouge reminds them that the danger is not over. 
They are beginning to worry about finding a new foster family when Kim runs into Meng. All the remaining siblings are reunited and decide to return to Bat Deng, Ma’s home village. As the head of the household, Meng agrees with Ma’s brothers that he should marry, and they choose a woman named Eang for him. After a few months, Eang’s sister arrives in Bat Deng with the news that their family fled to Vietnam when the Khmer Rouge entered Phnom Penh. Eang and Meng travel to Vietnam, but Meng returns in a few days with a plan to travel through Vietnam to Thailand, and then on to the United States. The voyage will be difficult and costly but, after five years in America, he will be able to reunite the entire family. Meng decides that as the youngest, Luong is the most likely to be able to make a good life in a new country, and the two leave on bicycle. 
In Phnom Penh, Meng books passage for he and Luong on a fishing vessel to Vietnam. The bustle of Saigon amazes Luong, who misses her siblings but is excited by the prospect of a new life. They remain in Vietnam for several months, first in Saigon then on a houseboat on the Mekong Delta, until the arrangements for human smugglers to take them to Thailand are complete. When they finally cross, the journey is perilous, with both storms and pirates menacing the refugees. Luckily, they survive and arrive at Lam Sing Refugee Camp. As they wait for sponsors, Meng converts to Christianity to increase their odds, and they worry about how to find sufficient food. At last, they learn that they have a new home in Vermont. The memoir ends as Luong boards the plane, having dreamt about Pa. A brief epilogue shows Luong returning to Cambodia as an adult and reconnecting with her family."
Resigned,"In 1998, Barbara Ehrenreich, a journalist and activist then in her late 50s, sets out to document the daily struggles of America’s working poor. Having trained as a biologist, she decides to do fieldwork: in three different U.S. cities, she takes minimum-wage jobs and looks for affordable places to live. She leaves her Ph.D. and most of her skills off of her applications, to ensure that she is given the lowest-level positions available to a white, native-English speaking woman. However, she will use outside cash, if necessary, to ensure that she will never be without a car, she will not have to skip meals to save money, and she will never be homeless.
Ehrenreich’s first experiences are in Key West, Florida. Her most affordable living option, cheaper than a trailer in town, is a shabby efficiency apartment thirty miles away. Although she expects to earn $7 per hour, the first job she lands, as a diner waitress, pays much less, because she will also earn tips. The job requires not only serving tables but also additional work, like cleaning and restocking. Although Ehrenreich gets along well with her coworkers, she struggles as a waitress, because of her lack of experience. Realizing that she will not be able to stay in her apartment on what she is earning, she tries takes a second waitressing job, at another diner. She quickly realizes she will be physically unable to work both jobs, quits the first job, and takes a hotel housekeeping job next door to the second diner, instead. However, when her supervisor at the second diner yells at her, Ehrenreich has had enough and walks out.
Ehrenreich’s next location is Portland, Maine. There, after much searching, she finds a small apartment she will be able to afford. She takes two jobs. The first is with a maid service that cleans the homes of affluent clients where she works on a cleaning team with several other women. The work is back-breaking, and Ehrenreich develops a skin rash of unknown origin. She sees the other women continue to work even when they are injured or feeling sick. She notices that the cleaning techniques the team is taught to use are more about making homes look cleaner than about actually cleaning them. She learns that her employer charges customers $25 per person-hour, while she will earn $6.65 an hour. Ehrenreich’s other job is at a nursing home, where she helps serve food to residents with Alzheimer’s. The interactions with the residents are pleasant, but the cleanup work after meals is overwhelming, partly because one of the automatic dishwashers is broken.
In Minneapolis, Minnesota, finally, Ehrenreich has a very hard time finding safe, sanitary housing she can afford. A charity worker suggests that she check into a shelter while saving up first month’s rent. She has two job applications accepted, but backs out of one job, at a hardware store, when her very first shift is scheduled to last eleven hours without overtime pay. The other job is in women’s clothing at Wal-Mart. The day-long orientation for new employees includes criticism of labor unions, while the pay is less than typical for the area. The store layout is constantly changing, and customers make extra work for her by leaving unbought merchandise in other departments. The job makes Ehrenreich, by her own account, callous and spiteful. Meanwhile, she has been unable to secure a long-term rental situation. Fed up, at one of the employee meetings she starts talking about the need for a union. By now, she has already decided to quit.
Reviewing her experiences in light of the data from many different studies, Ehrenreich comes to several conclusions. She finds that workers cannot support themselves on minimum wage in America unless they work multiple jobs, and only so long as there are no unexpected expenses, such as for medical care. Ehrenreich also finds that employers try to keep information about the wages they pay from becoming general knowledge among workers. Additionally, she finds that the ways in which workers are supervised, including random urine tests for drug use, encourage the workers to accept being dehumanized. Ehrenreich adds that the attitudes found in managers of low-wage employees are based on class or racial prejudice. Finally, she states that medical benefits and child care are too expensive even for middle-class workers, let alone ones on minimum wage. She notes that perhaps someday the working poor will refuse to stop accepting their situation and will demand that things change—and concludes that the country will be a better place when they do."

Intervened,"An ambitious, worldly young bank official named Joseph K. is arrested by two warders ""one fine morning,"" although he has done nothing wrong. K. is indignant and outraged. The morning happens to be that of his thirtieth birthday. One year later, on the morning of his thirty-first birthday, two warders again come for K. They take him to a quarry outside of town and kill him in the name of the Law. K. lets them.

The Trial is the chronicle of that intervening year of K.'s case, his struggles and encounters with the invisible Law and the untouchable Court. It is an account, ultimately, of state-induced self-destruction. Yet, as in all of Kafka's best writing, the ""meaning"" is far from clear. Just as the parable related by the chaplain in Chapter Nine (called ""The Doorkeeper"" or ""Before the Law"") elicits endless commentary from students of the Law, so has The Trial been a touchstone of twentieth-century critical interpretation. As some commentators have noted, it has, in parts, the quality of revealed truth; as such it is ultimately unresolvable--a mirror for any sectarian reading.
How to summarize this kind of text? It was written during 1914-1915, while Kafka was an official in the Workmen's Accident Insurance Institute for the Kingdom of Bohemia. On one level we can see in The Trial a satirical pillorying of the Austro-Hungarian bureaucracy of Kafka's day. Yet to many readers it is eerily prescient of the psychological weaponry used by the much more insidious totalitarian regimes to come, of the legally-sanctioned death machines Kafka never lived to see. It is also an unfinished novel, and this is apparent in the final chapters. It is at times as suffocating to read as the airless rooms of the Court that it describes. The German title, Der Prozess, connotes both a ""trial"" and a ""process,"" and it is perhaps this maddening feeling of inevitability that leaves a lasting visceral impression: the machinery has been set in motion, and the process will grind toward conclusion despite our most desperate exhortations."
Shallow,"A Raisin in the Sun portrays a few weeks in the life of the Youngers, a Black family living on the South Side of Chicago in the 1950s. When the play opens, the Youngers are about to receive an insurance check for $10,000. This money comes from the deceased Mr. Younger’s life insurance policy. Each of the adult members of the family has an idea as to what he or she would like to do with this money. The matriarch of the family, Mama, wants to buy a house to fulfill a dream she shared with her husband. Mama’s son, Walter Lee, would rather use the money to invest in a liquor store with his friends. He believes that the investment will solve the family’s financial problems forever. Walter’s wife, Ruth, agrees with Mama, however, and hopes that she and Walter can provide more space and opportunity for their son, Travis. Finally, Beneatha, Walter’s sister and Mama’s daughter, wants to use the money for her medical school tuition. She also wishes that her family members were not so interested in assimilating into the white world. Beneatha instead tries to find her identity by looking back to the past and to Africa.
As the play progresses, the Youngers clash over their competing dreams. Ruth discovers that she is pregnant but fears that if she has the child, she will put more financial pressure on her family members. When Walter says nothing to Ruth’s admission that she is considering abortion, Mama puts a down payment on a house for the whole family. She believes that a bigger, brighter dwelling will help them all. This house is in Clybourne Park, an entirely white neighborhood. When the Youngers’ future neighbors find out that the Youngers are moving in, they send Mr. Lindner, from the Clybourne Park Improvement Association, to offer the Youngers money in return for staying away. The Youngers refuse the deal, even after Walter loses the rest of the money ($6,500) to his friend Willy Harris, who persuades Walter to invest in the liquor store and then runs off with his cash.
In the meantime, Beneatha rejects her suitor, George Murchison, whom she believes to be shallow and blind to the problems of race. Subsequently, she receives a marriage proposal from her Nigerian boyfriend, Joseph Asagai, who wants Beneatha to get a medical degree and move to Africa with him (Beneatha does not make her choice before the end of the play). The Youngers eventually move out of the apartment, fulfilling the family’s long-held dream. Their future seems uncertain and slightly dangerous, but they are optimistic and determined to live a better life. They believe that they can succeed if they stick together as a family and resolve to defer their dreams no longer."
Danger,"In a pair of sumptuous drawingrooms, one in a Parisian mansion, the other in a chateau on a luxurious estate in the countryside surrounding Paris, two aristocrats are very bored. The Marquise de Merteuil decides, therefore, to construct a little intrigue for her own amusement and the amusement of her former lover, the Vicomte de Valmont. The Marquise is aware that a young girl of good family, Cécile Volanges, has only just left the convent so that she can be married to the Comte de Gercourt. Now, the Marquise has a bone to pick with this particular Comte, and so she suggests to the Vicomte that he seduce and debauch Cécile to create a scandal and humiliate Gercourt. Valmont accepts the Marquise's proposal somewhat coolly, since he already has his eyes on another prey, the highly religious Présidente de Tourvel, the chaste wife of a member of Parliament. But, never one to refuse a challenge, Valmont suggests that he and the Marquise enter into a slightly different bet: if he can obtain written proof that he has slept with the Présidente, the Marquise must yield herself to him.
Meanwhile, Cécile has been presented to society, and in society she meets the charming and gentle Chevalier Danceny. Danceny becomes Cécile's music teacher and slowly, with a little coaxing from the Marquise de Merteuil, the two young people fall in love. During this time, Valmont is out in the country on his aunt's estate, trying to turn the Présidente de Tourvel's head. He has very little luck in this department despite his use of every known trick in the book. Then, as coincidence would have, Cécile's mother, Madame Volanges, who corresponds regularly with the Présidente de Tourvel, happens to say some rather unflattering things about Valmont in a letter which Valmont just happens to steal and read. And thus it is that Valmont resolves to seduce the little Volanges as revenge for her mother's only too accurate trash-talk.
Cécile's ""seduction"" would be more accurately termed ""rape,"" but the girl is persuaded to enter into a bizarre student-teacher relationship with Valmont, so that for a while she is being courted by Danceny and ""loved"" nightly by Valmont. During his time as Cécile's teacher, Valmont is also able to win the heart of the Présidente de Tourvel.
However, the Marquise de Merteuil is not so easily pleased. Rather than encourage the Vicomte de Valmont to meet the conditions of their original agreement, she mocks him for having fallen in love with the Présidente de Tourvel. Valmont's pride does not withstand these attacks very well, and to avoid compromising his reputation as a good-for-nothing gigolo, he leaves the Présidente cold, with no explanation. Cécile fares no better, after a particularly rough night in Valmont's room, she miscarries his child.
Now things are really looking bad for everyone involved. The Présidente de Tourvel removes herself to a convent where she proceeds to die of grief and shame. Merteuil and Valmont are never able to reconcile their little snit and can only agree to go to war with one another. Danceny learns that Valmont seduced Cécile and challenges him to a duel; and Danceny wins the duel. Valmont hands over his correspondence with the Marquise to Danceny on his deathbed; all of society learns of her schemes and machinations. The Marquise is forced to flee town and, like a wicked old witch, is never heard from again. Full of regret for her activities with Valmont, Cécile returns to the convent from whence she came, with the intention of becoming a nun."
Admonition,"The Awakening opens in the late 1800s in Grand Isle, a summer holiday resort popular with the wealthy inhabitants of nearby New Orleans. Edna Pontellier is vacationing with her husband, Léonce, and their two sons at the cottages of Madame Lebrun, which house affluent Creoles from the French Quarter. Léonce is kind and loving but preoccupied with his work. His frequent business-related absences mar his domestic life with Edna. Consequently, Edna spends most of her time with her friend Adèle Ratignolle, a married Creole who epitomizes womanly elegance and charm. Through her relationship with Adèle, Edna learns a great deal about freedom of expression. Because Creole women were expected and assumed to be chaste, they could behave in a forthright and unreserved manner. Exposure to such openness liberates Edna from her previously prudish behavior and repressed emotions and desires.
Edna’s relationship with Adèle begins Edna’s process of “awakening” and self-discovery, which constitutes the focus of the book. The process accelerates as Edna comes to know Robert Lebrun, the elder, single son of Madame Lebrun. Robert is known among the Grand Isle vacationers as a man who chooses one woman each year—often a married woman—to whom he then plays “attendant” all summer long. This summer, he devotes himself to Edna, and the two spend their days together lounging and talking by the shore. Adèle Ratignolle often accompanies them.
At first, the relationship between Robert and Edna is innocent. They mostly bathe in the sea or engage in idle talk. As the summer progresses, however, Edna and Robert grow closer, and Robert’s affections and attention inspire in Edna several internal revelations. She feels more alive than ever before, and she starts to paint again as she did in her youth. She also learns to swim and becomes aware of her independence and sexuality. Edna and Robert never openly discuss their love for one another, but the time they spend alone together kindles memories in Edna of the dreams and desires of her youth. She becomes inexplicably depressed at night with her husband and profoundly joyful during her moments of freedom, whether alone or with Robert. Recognizing how intense the relationship between him and Edna has become, Robert honorably removes himself from Grand Isle to avoid consummating his forbidden love. Edna returns to New Orleans a changed woman.
Back in New Orleans, Edna actively pursues her painting and ignores all of her social responsibilities. Worried about the changing attitude and increasing disobedience of his wife, Léonce seeks the guidance of the family physician, Doctor Mandelet. A wise and enlightened man, Doctor Mandelet suspects that Edna’s transformation is the result of an affair, but he hides his suspicions from Léonce. Instead, Doctor Mandelet suggests that Léonce let Edna’s defiance run its course, since attempts to control her would only fuel her rebellion. Léonce heeds the doctor’s advice, allowing Edna to remain home alone while he is away on business. With her husband gone and her children away as well, Edna wholly rejects her former lifestyle. She moves into a home of her own and declares herself independent—the possession of no one. Her love for Robert still intense, Edna pursues an affair with the town seducer, Alcée Arobin, who is able to satisfy her sexual needs. Never emotionally attached to Arobin, Edna maintains control throughout their affair, satisfying her animalistic urges but retaining her freedom from male domination.
At this point, the self-sufficient and unconventional old pianist Mademoiselle Reisz adopts Edna as a sort of protégé, warning Edna of the sacrifices required of an artist. Edna is moved by Mademoiselle Reisz’s piano playing and visits her often. She is also eager to read the letters from abroad that Robert sends the woman. A woman who devotes her life entirely to her art, Mademoiselle serves as an inspiration and model to Edna, who continues her process of awakening and independence. Mademoiselle Reisz is the only person who knows of Robert and Edna’s secret love for one another and she encourages Edna to admit to, and act upon, her feelings.
Unable to stay away, Robert returns to New Orleans, finally expressing openly his feelings for Edna. He admits his love but reminds her that they cannot possibly be together, since she is the wife of another man. Edna explains to him her newly established independence, denying the rights of her husband over her and explaining how she and Robert can live together happily, ignoring everything extraneous to their relationship. But despite his love for Edna, Robert feels unable to enter into the adulterous affair.
When Adèle undergoes a difficult and dangerous childbirth, Edna leaves Robert’s arms to go to her friend. She pleads with him to wait for her return. From the time she spends with Edna, Adèle senses that Edna is becoming increasingly distant, and she understands that Edna’s relationship with Robert has intensified. She reminds Edna to think of her children and advocates the socially acceptable lifestyle Edna abandoned so long ago. Doctor Mandelet, while walking Edna home from Adèle’s, urges her to come see him because he is worried about the outcome of her passionate but confused actions. Already reeling under the weight of Adèle’s admonition, Edna begins to perceive herself as having acted selfishly.
Edna returns to her house to find Robert gone, a note of farewell left in his place. Robert’s inability to escape the ties of society now prompts Edna’s most devastating awakening. Haunted by thoughts of her children and realizing that she would have eventually found even Robert unable to fulfill her desires and dreams, Edna feels an overwhelming sense of solitude. Alone in a world in which she has found no feeling of belonging, she can find only one answer to the inescapable and heartbreaking limitations of society. She returns to Grand Isle, the site of her first moments of emotional, sexual, and intellectual awareness, and, in a final escape, gives herself to the sea. As she swims through the soft, embracing water, she thinks about her freedom from her husband and children, as well as Robert’s failure to understand her, Doctor Mandelet’s words of wisdom, and Mademoiselle Reisz’s courage. The text leaves open the question of whether the suicide constitutes a cowardly surrender or a liberating triumph."
Harmony,"In 1913, Anthony Patch is twenty-five years old. Anthony believes he is a superior person: He has a Harvard education and a trust fund large enough for him to live off its interest. He has an elegant apartment in New York City and wears perfect clothes. Anthony’s parents died in his childhood, and he is the grandson and only surviving direct heir of the extremely wealthy Adam J. Patch.
Adam J. Patch, after making millions on Wall Street, is now a famous moral reformer. He disapproves of Anthony’s lack of initiative or purpose. But to Anthony, idleness is the logical response to the meaninglessness of life. Anthony sees all the latest plays, belongs to fancy clubs, and exchanges idle talk, always over drinks, with his Harvard classmates Maury Noble and Richard Caramel.
Richard introduces Anthony to his beautiful cousin, Gloria Gilbert, a vain, party-mad society girl with scandals in her past. Gloria brings a movie producer, Joseph Bloeckman, and her girlfriends Muriel and Rachael into Anthony’s social circle. Richard, who is working on a novel, cultivates Bloeckman as a useful contact. Anthony recognizes Bloeckman as a rival suitor of Gloria.
Anthony asks Gloria out. She leads him on but also keeps seeing Bloeckman and other men. Anthony becomes ever more obsessed with Gloria. He sees her as a kindred spirit, determined to live only for pleasure. Anthony tries to stay away from her but cannot. When Anthony asks Gloria to marry him and tells her he loves her, she replies that she’s glad.
Gloria and Anthony have a lavish wedding at Anthony’s grandfather’s mansion, followed by a honeymoon in California, flitting from party to party. When they get back to New York, they rent a house in the country and entertain their friends for long weekends. Anthony and Gloria spend too much money, but they expect to be wealthy when Anthony’s grandfather dies.
When war breaks out in Europe, Adam J. Patch calls his grandson to account for his idleness and suggests that he become a war correspondent. However, Anthony and Gloria prefer to keep hosting their perpetual party. Their finances get worse as their friends’ incomes improve. Richard’s novel becomes a success, and Maury lands a respectable job. Joseph Bloeckman’s films become more popular. Yet Anthony still has no plan.
The next year, Gloria and Anthony can’t afford a California trip. Because of the war, rents skyrocket, and they have to move to a smaller apartment, farther uptown in New York. They drink more and more and keep going out to clubs, shows, and dances. Anthony too often foots the bill for the dinners and drinks of others. He now dips into his capital to meet his expenses, which reduces their income.
One day while drunk, Anthony and Gloria sign the lease for the house in the country by mistake, so they are forced to spend another summer away from the city. During one especially drunken party, just as Gloria begins dancing wildly, Anthony’s grandfather appears at the door. He takes a long look at the revelry and then asks Shuttleworth, his secretary, to escort him home. Anthony and Gloria realize they are in serious trouble. Anthony tries to see his grandfather to apologize, but Shuttleworth won’t let him. His grandfather won’t even answer Anthony’s letters.
Soon, Anthony’s grandfather dies, and Anthony learns he has been left out of his will. Anthony and Gloria file a lawsuit to invalidate the will on the grounds of Shuttleworth’s undue influence on Anthony’s grandfather. By this point, Anthony and Gloria regularly quarrel bitterly over money. To resolve their arguments, they dream about winning the lawsuit—and they drink. Gloria’s friend Muriel tells them of the rumors that Anthony caused his grandfather’s death.
When the United States enters World War I, Anthony is turned down for officers’ training and then drafted into the army. Anthony spends the next several months at army camps in the South. For the first time in his life, he mixes with men from the lower classes. Anthony begins an affair with nineteen-year-old Dot Raycroft. One night, Anthony misses curfew because of seeing Dot and is sentenced to a month’s confinement. After his confinement ends, he gets influenza. Soon after his recovery, Anthony’s regiment is ordered to New York. The war ends just as Anthony gets back home.
Anthony’s army service leaves Gloria alone in New York City. She tracks the progress of their lawsuit and drinks in self-pity. Encouraged by her friend Rachael, she goes out with men, but she stays faithful to Anthony. After the war ends, Gloria and Anthony have a brief second romance, but their harmony is soon shattered by poverty and drinking. Without telling Anthony, Gloria calls Bloeckman, who arranges for her to have an audition and screen test. When the director decides she is too old for the part, Gloria weeps for the loss of her youth and beauty.
Gloria and Anthony move even farther uptown and lose even more of their income. Anthony descends into alcoholism. Gloria sinks so low that she cooks and does housework. The bank informs Anthony that they’ve closed his account. Anthony spends a drunken night trying to borrow grocery money. Maury, his former best friend, snubs him. Joseph Bloeckman beats him up and has him thrown out into the street.
Then, just as Anthony reaches the depth of his humiliation, the lawsuit over Adam J. Patch’s fortune is resolved in Anthony’s favor. Gloria and her cousin Richard are at court for the verdict. Anthony intends to join them but is delayed because Dot appears at his door. Dot has heard about the lawsuit and tells Anthony that she loves him. Anthony screams at Dot and tries to attack her with a chair. When Gloria and Richard come home with the news that Anthony is now worth $30 million, they find him sitting on the floor playing with his stamp collection.
Some months later, Anthony and Gloria are aboard a luxury liner. The other passengers gossip about Anthony’s mental breakdown and Gloria’s Russian sable coat. Anthony sits in his wheelchair, looking out at the ocean, and feels proud of himself for having endured so much and for sticking to his principles."
Womanhood,"The Woman Warrior focuses on the stories of five women—Kingston's long-dead aunt, ""No-Name Woman""; a mythical female warrior, Fa Mu Lan; Kingston's mother, Brave Orchid; Kingston's aunt, Moon Orchid; and finally Kingston herself—told in five chapters. The chapters integrate Kingston's lived experience with a series of talk-stories—spoken stories that combine Chinese history, myths, and beliefs—her mother tells her.
The first chapter, ""No-Name Woman,"" begins with one such talk-story, about an aunt Kingston never knew she had. Because this aunt had brought disgrace upon her family by having an illegitimate child, she killed herself and her baby by jumping into the family well in China. After hearing the story, which is told to her as a warning, Kingston is never allowed to mention her aunt aloud again, so she decides to create a history of her aunt in her memoir. She imagines the ways that her aunt attracted a suitor, comparing her aunt's actions of quiet rebellion against the community to her own rebellion. Kingston also recreates her aunt's horrible experience of giving birth in a pigsty and imagines her aunt's ghost walking around with no one to give it gifts, as was Chinese custom. In the end, Kingston is unsure whether she is doing justice to her aunt's memory or just serving her own needs.
""White Tigers"" is based on another talk-story, one about the mythical female warrior Fa Mu Lan. Fa Mu Lan, whose story is told through Kingston's first-person narrative, trains to become a warrior from the time she is seven years old, then leads an army of men—even pretending to be a man herself—against the forces of a corrupt baron and emperor. After her battles are over, she returns to be a wife and mother. The story of Fa Mu Lan is contrasted sharply with Kingston's own life in America, in which she can barely stand up to her racist bosses. Kingston realizes, however, that her weapons are her words.
""Shaman"" focuses on Kingston's mother, Brave Orchid, and her old life back in China. Brave Orchid was a powerful doctor, midwife, and, according to the talk-story, destroyer of ghosts back in her village. To a young Kingston, Brave Orchid's past is as astounding as it is terrifying, and many of the images from her mother's talk-story—Chinese babies left to die, slave girls being bought and sold, a woman stoned to death by her villagers—haunt Kingston's dreams for years to come. At the end of the chapter, Maxine visits her mother after being away for many years. The two arrive at some kind of understanding after many years of disagreement and conflict, and Brave Orchid is warm and affectionate towards her daughter for the first time in the memoir.
The title of ""At the Western Palace"" refers to another of Brave Orchid's talk-stories, about an emperor who had four wives. It is an analogy for her sister Moon Orchid's situation: Moon Orchid's husband, now a successful Los Angeles doctor, had left her behind in China and remarried in America. Brave Orchid urges her sister into a disastrous confrontation with the man to demand her due as his wife. As a result, Moon Orchid, who does not speak a word of English, is left to fend for herself in America. She eventually becomes insane and dies in a California state mental asylum.
The final chapter of the memoir, ""A Song for a Barbarian Reed Pipe,"" is about Kingston herself. This section focuses mainly on her childhood and teenage years, depicting her anger and frustration in trying to express herself and attempting to please an unappreciative mother. There are a number of characters whose personalities highlight many of her Kingston's own characteristics, including a silent Chinese girl whom Kingston torments as a little girl. In a pivotal moment in the chapter, Kingston, after unsuccessfully trying to express her feelings one at a time, erupts at her mother with a torrent of complaints and criticisms.
Later in her life, however, Kingston comes to appreciate her mother's talk-stories. At the end of the chapter she even tells one herself: the story of Ts'ai Yen, a warrior poetess captured by barbarians who returns to the Chinese with songs from another land. It is a fitting conclusion to a text in which Kingston combines very different worlds and cultures and create a harmony of her own."
Infraction,"A wake-up call sounds in a Stalinist labor camp in 1951, on a bitterly cold winter morning. Ivan Denisovich Shukhov, a prisoner in Camp HQ, is usually up on time, but this morning he suffers a fever and aches, and yearns for a little more time in bed. Thinking that a kindly guard is on duty, he rests past the wake-up call a while. Unfortunately, a different guard is making the rounds, and he punishes Shukhov for oversleeping with three days in the solitary confinement cell, which the characters call “the hole.” Led off, Shukhov soon realizes that the sentence is just a threat, and that he will only have to wash the floors of the officers’ headquarters. Shukhov removes his shoes and efficiently completes the job, proceeding quickly to the mess hall, where he worries he has missed breakfast. He meets the sniveling Fetyukov, a colleague who has saved Shukhov’s gruel for him. After breakfast, Shukhov heads to sick bay to get his fever and aches examined. The medical orderly, Kolya, tells him he should have been ill the previous night, since the clinic is closed in the morning. Shukhov’s fever is not high enough to get him off work.
Shukhov returns to the hut in time for the body search and body count, in which the prisoners are searched for forbidden articles and counted to make sure none have escaped. He carefully hides the bread he has taken at breakfast, sewing it into his mattress. The men undress in the freezing cold for the search. One inmate, Buynovsky, is wearing a flannel vest. He is sentenced to ten days in the hole for this infraction. Shukhov is happy not to have any forbidden things on him. He has neither food nor letters to his family, which he does not write anymore. He reflects on his wife’s recent letter urging him to take up carpet-dyeing when he gets out of prison. But Shukhov is not interested in this opportunity, despite the easy money.
After the search, Shukhov’s group, Gang 104, is marched off for work at the Power Station, a building site in the open fields. At the site, Shukhov looks at his colleague Alyoshka, a devout Baptist who seems happy to slave away. Shukhov is filled with respect for his foreman, Tyurin, a big tough man with a decent soul. Though they are forbidden to do so, the men try to keep the wind out of the windows by covering them with tar paper. The teenage prisoner Gopchik fetches wire for piping, and asks Shukhov to show him how to make a spoon. They all rest a while. It is too soon before the noon meal to start laying bricks, as the mortar would only dry in the trough while they ate.
At the noon meal, Shukhov sneaks a second helping of food. He is full after eating two bowls of gruel. The gang returns to the work site. On the way, Shukhov spots a bit of scrap metal in the snow, which he takes and hides in the hopes of making a knife out of it later. The prisoners stoke the stove. While preparing to work again, the gang hears Tyurin’s tale of being imprisoned for having a rich peasant father. The men begin to mortar the wall. One of the deputy foremen, Pavlo, agrees to be on the mortar team, though, as an officer, he is not required to mortar. Pavlo’s friendliness earns him the men’s respect. The bricklaying begins. Shukhov works feverishly and makes no errors. A camp manager stops by to chide Tyurin for the tar paper illegally hung in the work site windows. He threatens to punish Tyurin, but Tyurin waves him off. Alyoshka works selflessly. Time passes quickly, and the men hear the meal signal. Shukhov continues working, even after his colleague Kildigs has stopped. He is late to lunch now, but he wants to hide his precious trowel, a tool that is hard to get, so that another man will not take it. He is nearly unable to join his gang, but catches up when the gang is delayed by preparations for another body count. The men discover that a man from Moldavia is missing from another gang. The man, who has fallen asleep at the site, is finally found. The other men are furious at him for delaying their meal.
Shukhov remembers his earlier intention to go to sick bay but reflects that he would rather have supper. At the body search, Shukhov suddenly panics, remembering the bit of steel he has hidden in his mitten. He prays to God to be kept out of the hole. By a stroke of good luck, the guard does not discover the bit of steel. Shukhov returns to the camp. On the suspicion that a fellow inmate, Tsezar, has received a rich parcel of food, he offers to wait in line in the parcel room for Tsezar. Shukhov waits until Tsezar comes. There is indeed a package. Shukhov makes his way to the mess hall for supper, where the gangs are being admitted by twos instead of singly, creating a chaos inside. He manages to find his comrades, grab an empty tray, and bring their rations to the table. For his outstanding labor at the Power Station, Shukhov has been awarded 400 grams of bread. He eats in bliss, eyeing his extra rations to make sure no one grabs them. He takes Tsezar’s ration to the hut, where Tsezar, in exception to the camp rules, is allowed to eat. Tsezar has displayed the contents of his parcel to everyone, and he allows Shukhov to keep Tsezar’s supper ration.
After the body count, Shukhov prepares to sleep, though the second count has not yet been completed. He revels in his abundance of bread. At the second roll call, Tsezar panics, unsure what to do with his parcel. Shukhov helps him guard it from the other prisoners. Tsezar rewards Shukhov with a couple of biscuits and a bit of sausage. Before sleeping, Shukhov thanks God for getting him through another day. Alyoshka hears Shukhov’s prayer, and urges Shukhov to pray properly. He also encourages Shukhov to pursue the goods of the spirit and not, as Tsezar does, those of the flesh. Shukhov reflects on Alyoshka’s sentiment. Suddenly, for no reason, he hands Alyoshka one of his biscuits. Shukhov meditates that his day has been almost happy. The narrator adds that this day has been just one of the 3,653 days of Shukhov’s sentence."
Adventure,"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn opens by familiarizing us with the events of the novel that preceded it, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. Both novels are set in the town of St. Petersburg, Missouri, which lies on the banks of the Mississippi River. At the end of Tom Sawyer, Huckleberry Finn, a poor boy with a drunken bum for a father, and his friend Tom Sawyer, a middle-class boy with an imagination too active for his own good, found a robber’s stash of gold. As a result of his adventure, Huck gained quite a bit of money, which the bank held for him in trust. Huck was adopted by the Widow Douglas, a kind but stifling woman who lives with her sister, the self-righteous Miss Watson.
As Huckleberry Finn opens, Huck is none too thrilled with his new life of cleanliness, manners, church, and school. However, he sticks it out at the bequest of Tom Sawyer, who tells him that in order to take part in Tom’s new “robbers’ gang,” Huck must stay “respectable.” All is well and good until Huck’s brutish, drunken father, Pap, reappears in town and demands Huck’s money. The local judge, Judge Thatcher, and the Widow try to get legal custody of Huck, but another well-intentioned new judge in town believes in the rights of Huck’s natural father and even takes the old drunk into his own home in an attempt to reform him. This effort fails miserably, and Pap soon returns to his old ways. He hangs around town for several months, harassing his son, who in the meantime has learned to read and to tolerate the Widow’s attempts to improve him. Finally, outraged when the Widow Douglas warns him to stay away from her house, Pap kidnaps Huck and holds him in a cabin across the river from St. Petersburg.
Whenever Pap goes out, he locks Huck in the cabin, and when he returns home drunk, he beats the boy. Tired of his confinement and fearing the beatings will worsen, Huck escapes from Pap by faking his own death, killing a pig and spreading its blood all over the cabin. Hiding on Jackson’s Island in the middle of the Mississippi River, Huck watches the townspeople search the river for his body. After a few days on the island, he encounters Jim, one of Miss Watson’s slaves. Jim has run away from Miss Watson after hearing her talk about selling him to a plantation down the river, where he would be treated horribly and separated from his wife and children. Huck and Jim team up, despite Huck’s uncertainty about the legality or morality of helping a runaway slave. While they camp out on the island, a great storm causes the Mississippi to flood. Huck and Jim spy a log raft and a house floating past the island. They capture the raft and loot the house, finding in it the body of a man who has been shot. Jim refuses to let Huck see the dead man’s face.
Although the island is blissful, Huck and Jim are forced to leave after Huck learns from a woman onshore that her husband has seen smoke coming from the island and believes that Jim is hiding out there. Huck also learns that a reward has been offered for Jim’s capture. Huck and Jim start downriver on the raft, intending to leave it at the mouth of the Ohio River and proceed up that river by steamboat to the free states, where slavery is prohibited. Several days’ travel takes them past St. Louis, and they have a close encounter with a gang of robbers on a wrecked steamboat. They manage to escape with the robbers’ loot.
During a night of thick fog, Huck and Jim miss the mouth of the Ohio and encounter a group of men looking for escaped slaves. Huck has a brief moral crisis about concealing stolen “property”—Jim, after all, belongs to Miss Watson—but then lies to the men and tells them that his father is on the raft suffering from smallpox. Terrified of the disease, the men give Huck money and hurry away. Unable to backtrack to the mouth of the Ohio, Huck and Jim continue downriver. The next night, a steamboat slams into their raft, and Huck and Jim are separated.
Huck ends up in the home of the kindly Grangerfords, a family of Southern aristocrats locked in a bitter and silly feud with a neighboring clan, the Shepherdsons. The elopement of a Grangerford daughter with a Shepherdson son leads to a gun battle in which many in the families are killed. While Huck is caught up in the feud, Jim shows up with the repaired raft. Huck hurries to Jim’s hiding place, and they take off down the river.
A few days later, Huck and Jim rescue a pair of men who are being pursued by armed bandits. The men, clearly con artists, claim to be a displaced English duke (the duke) and the long-lost heir to the French throne (the dauphin). Powerless to tell two white adults to leave, Huck and Jim continue down the river with the pair of “aristocrats.” The duke and the dauphin pull several scams in the small towns along the river. Coming into one town, they hear the story of a man, Peter Wilks, who has recently died and left much of his inheritance to his two brothers, who should be arriving from England any day. The duke and the dauphin enter the town pretending to be Wilks’s brothers. Wilks’s three nieces welcome the con men and quickly set about liquidating the estate. A few townspeople become skeptical, and Huck, who grows to admire the Wilks sisters, decides to thwart the scam. He steals the dead Peter Wilks’s gold from the duke and the dauphin but is forced to stash it in Wilks’s coffin. Huck then reveals all to the eldest Wilks sister, Mary Jane. Huck’s plan for exposing the duke and the dauphin is about to unfold when Wilks’s real brothers arrive from England. The angry townspeople hold both sets of Wilks claimants, and the duke and the dauphin just barely escape in the ensuing confusion. Fortunately for the sisters, the gold is found. Unfortunately for Huck and Jim, the duke and the dauphin make it back to the raft just as Huck and Jim are pushing off.
After a few more small scams, the duke and dauphin commit their worst crime yet: they sell Jim to a local farmer, telling him Jim is a runaway for whom a large reward is being offered. Huck finds out where Jim is being held and resolves to free him. At the house where Jim is a prisoner, a woman greets Huck excitedly and calls him “Tom.” As Huck quickly discovers, the people holding Jim are none other than Tom Sawyer’s aunt and uncle, Silas and Sally Phelps. The Phelpses mistake Huck for Tom, who is due to arrive for a visit, and Huck goes along with their mistake. He intercepts Tom between the Phelps house and the steamboat dock, and Tom pretends to be his own younger brother, Sid.
Tom hatches a wild plan to free Jim, adding all sorts of unnecessary obstacles even though Jim is only lightly secured. Huck is sure Tom’s plan will get them all killed, but he complies nonetheless. After a seeming eternity of pointless preparation, during which the boys ransack the Phelps’s house and make Aunt Sally miserable, they put the plan into action. Jim is freed, but a pursuer shoots Tom in the leg. Huck is forced to get a doctor, and Jim sacrifices his freedom to nurse Tom. All are returned to the Phelps’s house, where Jim ends up back in chains.
When Tom wakes the next morning, he reveals that Jim has actually been a free man all along, as Miss Watson, who made a provision in her will to free Jim, died two months earlier. Tom had planned the entire escape idea all as a game and had intended to pay Jim for his troubles. Tom’s Aunt Polly then shows up, identifying “Tom” and “Sid” as Huck and Tom. Jim tells Huck, who fears for his future—particularly that his father might reappear—that the body they found on the floating house off Jackson’s Island had been Pap’s. Aunt Sally then steps in and offers to adopt Huck, but Huck, who has had enough “sivilizing,” announces his plan to set out for the West."
Colonial,"In Common Sense, Thomas Paine argues for American independence. His argument begins with more general, theoretical reflections about government and religion, then progresses onto the specifics of the colonial situation.
Paine begins by distinguishing between government and society. Society, according to Paine, is everything constructive and good that people join together to accomplish. Government, on the other hand, is an institution whose sole purpose is to protect us from our own vices. Government has its origins in the evil of man and is therefore a necessary evil at best. Paine says that government's sole purpose is to protect life, liberty and property, and that a government should be judged solely on the basis of the extent to which it accomplishes this goal.
Paine then considers an imagined scenario in which a small group of people has been placed on an island, and cut off from the rest of society. In time, these people develop ties with one another, and lawmaking becomes inevitable. Paine says the people will be much happier if they are responsible for the creation of the laws that rule them. Paine is also implicitly arguing that such a system of representation is also better for the American colonists. Having expressed his disagreement with British reign in America, Paine proceeds to launch a general attack on the British system of government. Paine says the British system is too complex and rife with contradictions, and that the monarchy is granted far too much power. The British system pretends to offer a reasonable system of checks and balances, but in fact, it does not.
From here Paine moves on to discuss, in general, the notions of monarchy and hereditary succession. Man, Pain argues, was born into a state of equality, and the distinction that has arisen between king and subject is an unnatural one. At first, Paine says, the world was without kings, but the ancient Jews decided they wanted a king. This angered God, but he allowed them to have one. Paine presents pages of biblical evidence detailing God's wrath at the idea of the Jews having a king. The conclusion Paine reaches is that the practice of monarchy originates from sin, and is an institution that the Bible and God condemn. Paine calls hereditary succession an abominable practice. He says that even if people were to choose to have a king, that does not legitimize that King's child acting as a future ruler. Furthermore, hereditary succession has brought with it innumerable evils, such as incompetent kings, corruption, and civil war.
Having dispensed with the preliminary theoretical issues, Paine sets in to discuss the details of the American situation. In response to the argument that America has flourished under British rule, and therefore ought to stay under the king, Paine says that such an argument fails to realize that America has evolved and no longer needs Britain's help. Some say that Britain has protected America, and therefore deserves allegiance, but Paine responds that Britain has only watched over America in order to secure its own economic well-being. Paine adds that most recently, instead of watching over the colonies, the British have been attacking them, and are therefore undeserving of American loyalty.
Paine says that the colonies have little to gain from remaining attached to Britain. Commerce can be better conducted with the rest of Europe, but only after America becomes independent. Paine also asserts that if the colonies remain attached to Britain, the same problems that have arisen in the past will arise in the future. Paine argues that it is necessary to seek independence now, as to do otherwise would only briefly cover up problems that will surely reemerge.
Paine even proposes the form of government that the independent colonies should adopt. His recommendation is for a representative democracy that gives roughly equal weight to each of the colonies.
Paine explains why the current time is a good time to break free of Britain. Primarily, Paine focuses on the present size of the colonies, and on their current capabilities. He presents an inventory of the British Navy and gives calculations revealing how America could build a navy of comparable size. Paine recommends this as a way of ensuring America's security and prosperity in trade. Paine also argues that America is sufficiently small as to be united now. If time were to elapse, and the population of the colonies to grow, the same feeling of unity would not be present. Paine adds that if the Americans revolt now, they can use the vast expanses of uncharted land to the West in order to pay down some of the debt they will incur.
Paine says that as a colony of Britain, America lacks respectability on the international scene. They are seen simply as rebels, and cannot form substantial alliances with other nations. In order to prosper in the long term, the colonies need to be independent. Paine says that, by declaring independence, America will be able to ask for the help of other countries in its struggle for freedom. For all of these reasons, Paine says it is imperative and urgent that the colonies declare independence."
Renewal,"Regeneration begins with Siegfried Sassoon's open letter, dated July 1917, protesting the conduct and insincerities of the First World War. The letter has been published in the London Times and has received much attention in England, as many people are upset over the length and toll of the war thus far. The army is not sure what to do with Sassoon, as his letter clearly threatens to undermine the strength of the war effort at home.
With the string-pulling and guidance of Robert Graves, a fellow poet and friend of Sassoon, the Board agrees to send Sassoon to Craiglockhart War Hospital—a mental facility in Scotland—rather than court-marshaling him. Sassoon is at first hesitant to agree to this, since he (rightly) fears that being committed to a mental hospital will undermine his cause; however, convinced by Graves that there is no other option, Sassoon agrees.
At Craiglockhart, Sassoon meets with Dr. W.H.R. Rivers, a former anthropologist turned psychiatrist who encourages his patients to express their war memories so that they can heal their ""nerves."" Though Rivers can sympathize with the strong dislike of the horrors of war, he believes it is his duty to encourage Sassoon to return to France to fight.
There are many soldiers with various problems and ailments in the hospital. Burns, an emaciated man, has been unable to eat since a shell threw him into the gas-filled stomach of a German corpse. Anderson, a former war surgeon, is now terrified at the sight of blood, and is worried about resuming his civilian medical practice. Prior, a young, stubborn, and slightly difficult patient, enters the hospital suffering from mutism. Rivers meets with each of them in turn, helping them to recover from their problems.
One stormy night, Burns leaves the hospital, makes a trip far into the countryside, and comes across a tree with dead animals hanging from it. He is at first frightened, but he then starts removing the animals from the branches one by one and arranging them in a circle. Burns lies down in the middle of the circle, naked, and he feels soothed. Eventually, Burns returns to the hospital, but no one finds out about this episode.
Dr. Rivers is personally and emotionally tied to the welfare of his patients. One night, he has a nightmare about old nerve regeneration experiments he used to conduct with his old friend, Henry Head. At Cambridge, the two had severed a nerve in Head's hand with the purpose of charting its gradual regeneration. Rivers still feels guilty about the pain he inflicted on his friend, as well as the pain he inflicts on his patients by forcing them to talk about their war experiences.
Sassoon's letter is read in the House of Commons and is dismissed, as he is considered mentally unstable. Though Sassoon expected this result, he is still saddened and disappointed by the news. Slowly, he begins to become friends with another patient in the hospital, Wilfred Owen. Owen is also a poet and he greatly respects Sassoon's work; Sassoon agrees to help Owen with his poetry.
Prior, who has regained his voice, finds his way to a pub in Edinburgh where he meets a young munitions worker named Sarah Lumb. They strike up an acquaintance and agree to see each other again. When Prior returns to the hospital, Rivers tries hypnosis on Prior to see if it enables him to remember the tragic events that led to his breakdown. The hypnosis works, and Prior remembers in vivid detail having to shovel his men's remains after they were killed by a shell. Prior's memories anger and upset him. The next week, Prior takes Sarah to a seaside town where they see crowds of people walking on the beach. Prior envies and resents the way these people can just escape from the war. A storm comes, and Prior and Sarah make love under the shelter of a thornbush.
After a very busy day, Rivers wakes up in the middle of the night with chest pain; his doctor insists that he take three weeks vacation. During these three weeks, he visits his brother's house and reflects on his relationship with his deceased father. Rivers then visits his old friend Henry Head, who offers him a terrific job at a war hospital in London. Finally Rivers visits Burns's house in Suffolk for a few days. The Review Board has given Burns an unconditional discharge from the army. While at Suffolk, Burns has an episode and tries to commit suicide by hiding in a hole that floods at high tide. Rivers finds Burns, however, and saves him.
Back at Craiglockhart, the Board has granted Prior permanent home service; he will not have to return to the war. Prior sneaks into Sarah's room and tells her the news. Though they are both skeptical about love, they agree to give their relationship a try. Meanwhile, Sassoon has also come to a very important decision. Although he still disagrees with the brutality and suffering of the war, he decides to return to France in order to care for his men. Both Graves and Rivers are pleased with this decision.
Dr. Rivers decides to take the job in London, and leaves Craiglockhart in glory (Willard, one of his patients, has overcome his mental block and is now able to walk again). In London, Rivers is fascinated by his new work. Dr. Yealland, another psychiatrist specializing in war patients, invites Rivers to the National Hospital to come on his rounds. Rivers watches one of Yealland's horrific electro-shock therapy sessions on a patient named Callan. That night, Rivers has a nightmare that he is shoving a horse's bit into Sassoon's mouth, similar to the way Yealland shoved the electrode into the patient's mouth.
Rivers returns to Craiglockhart for a monthly Review Board meeting. The Board grants Anderson a desk position in the War Office and discharges Sassoon to duty, to return to France to fight. As Rivers says farewell to Sassoon, he realizes how much his own views about the war have changed."
Sap,"In the shadows within her father’s palace, Circe is mocked and scorned by members of her divine family. She seeks to please others and feel valued but continues to be an afterthought to her parents and a target for her brother and sister’s cruel taunts. When Circe sees Prometheus being whipped and condemned to a terrible fate, she defies her father and brings Prometheus nectar and talks with him. He is the first being to ever suggest to her that she could strive to be different from the other gods. That interaction has a lasting effect on Circe as does the birth of a new brother, Aeëtes, who is also rejected by their mother. As he grows to become Circe’s one and only source of love and friendship, Aeëtes reveals that he has heard secrets the gods talk about. When he tells Circe about pharmaka, magical herbs that grow from blood spilled when the Titans and Olympians battled, the course of Circe’s life changes.  
 
Circe’s loneliness grows when her siblings all leave their father’s palace. Pasiphaë marries King Minos and leaves. Helios gifts Aeëtes with a kingdom far away, and Circe’s brother Perses also leaves. When Circe meets the mortal sailor Glaucos they become friends, and Circe falls in love. Knowing she can never have a life with a mortal, Circe asks her grandmother, Tethys, to change Glaucos into a god. When Tethys says it’s impossible, Circe asks if it could be done through pharmaka. Tethys is horrified at the idea, but Circe learns where divine blood was spilled, goes there, finds magical flowers, and lets sap drip into Glaucos’s mouth as he naps. When he transforms into an arrogant, blue-skinned sea god, Circe believes her dreams of love will finally be realized, and Glaucos is welcomed as a member of the divine family. Instead of marrying Circe, however, Glaucos chooses a nymph named Scylla. Circe is devastated, especially since she thinks of Scylla as vain and cruel. In her desire to divert Glaucos’s plans, Circe pours the magical sap into a cove where Scylla bathes with the idea that it will make Scylla as ugly on the outside as Circe believes she is on the inside. Instead, Scylla becomes a horrifying, six-headed monster who flees to live in a cave near a whirlpool. Horrified and crushed by guilt, Circe confesses to Helios who says what she claims is impossible. It’s only when Aeëtes visits and tells Helios that he, his sisters, and brother are all pharmakis, witches, capable of incredible acts of magic, that Helios takes Circe seriously for the first time in her life.  
It’s decided in a meeting between Helios and Zeus that Circe will be exiled because she’s the only one who willingly sought out pharmaka. The next day, Helios abandons her on an island where she must remain forever. Her new home, Aiaia, has a beautiful house filled with everything she needs, and Circe devotes herself to learning about and honing her witchcraft. Circe’s happiness and newfound sense of freedom ends, however, when Hermes appears one day and shares gossip, including news of how Scylla has been murdering and eating passing sailors. Circe and Hermes become lovers, though she says she will never bear him a child. 
One day, a ship arrives on Aiaia with Daedalus onboard. Circe remembers seeing him at Pasiphaë’s wedding to Minos, and he’s still under Pasiphaë’s control. Circe’s cruel sister sent Daedalus to bring Circe to her. Although she distrusts Pasiphaë, Circe agrees and uses the opportunity to sail through Scylla’s territory to try to stop the monster she created. The spells fail, and sailors on their ship are eaten. Seeing the horror of Scylla in person consumes Circe with guilt. More horror awaits in Crete where the pregnant and laboring Pasiphaë tells Circe she must help her deliver her baby, a monster called the Minotaur, who is the result of Pasiphaë coupling with a magical bull. After cutting the creature from her sister, Circe and Daedalus put the Minotaur in a cage, and Circe makes a potion to control the monster’s appetite to just one season each year. Daedalus and Circe become lovers, and when she leaves, he gives her a loom and materials to weave on it.  
After returning to Aiaia, Circe is lonelier than ever until another ship arrives with Aeëtes’s daughter Medea and her husband Jason. They ask to be cleansed, and Circe does it. Later, they reveal that Medea killed her own brother in order to slow down her father’s pursuit after they took his golden fleece. After observing the couple, Circe tells her niece privately that she doesn’t think her marriage to Jason will last and asks her to live with her on Aiaia and practice their magic together. Medea scorns the offer, declares her love for and trust in Jason, and says Circe is just lonely. Medea and Jason leave, and Aeëtes arrives soon after, furious that Circe didn’t detain the pair. For the first time, however, Circe stands up to him, and he leaves. 
Without any warning, the young nymph Alke arrives and says she was sent to live with Circe as punishment. More nymphs arrive as word spreads among the gods that sending disobedient daughters to Aiaia is a good idea. When Hermes visits, Circe complains about the presence of all the nymphs, and Hermes says she’s gotten dull. Finally disgusted with him, Circe tells Hermes she’s done with him. Another ship arrives with sailors who say they’re lost, and Circe is excited by the prospect of being helpful and useful. Still, she is wise enough to be cautious and adds a potion to the wine in case they mean harm. Despite her precautions, the captain rapes Circe, covering her mouth so she can’t speak the spell to save herself. After it’s over, she turns all the men into pigs and slaughters them. More ships come, and Circe turns all the sailors into pigs until a man named Odysseus arrives alone and says his crew visited while he waited by the shore. For the first time, Circe finds someone who is a match for her wit and is impressed when Odysseus takes care in how he speaks to her and doesn’t drink the enchanted wine. Intrigued, Circe transforms his crew back, and they stay for a year, during which time Odysseus and Circe become lovers. He tells her about his adventures, including the Trojan War and how the goddess Athena is his patron, but he eventually leaves to return to his wife and son. Unbeknownst to him, Circe is pregnant with Odysseus’s son. 
Circe is sick throughout her pregnancy, and she has a hard time birthing Telegonus. He is a difficult baby who always seems to be in danger of harm. When the goddess Athena visits and demands the baby, Circe summons all her powers to put a spell over the entire island to protect Telegonus from Athena. For sixteen years, the boy grows up healthy and happy on Aiaia until he reveals that he wants to go find his father. Terrified of what could happen to him if he leaves her zone of protection, Circe refuses, and she’s furious when she learns Hermes has secretly helped the boy build a boat. Ultimately, though, Circe realizes she can’t stop him. She goes to the bottom of the sea to challenge Trygon, a massive stingray with a poison tail that is said to be able to wound even the gods. After winning the tail, she makes a spear for Telegonus with Trygon’s tail to take on his journey, and Telegonus sails for Ithaca to meet Odysseus. 
After long days of waiting, Circe welcomes Telegonus home, but he has brought Penelope and Telemachus with him. As his story unfolds about his journey, Telegonus tearfully confides how he accidentally killed Odysseus with the spear. Telemachus did not try to avenge his father’s death, so he and his mother had to flee the angry and vengeful citizens of Ithaca. When Telegonus brings them to his mother, Telemachus tells Circe that his father was paranoid and violent, and Penelope confesses that she’s afraid Athena will kill Telemachus for not seeking revenge. Although still suspicious and on guard, Circe allows them to stay, and they live peacefully together until Hermes comes with a message that Athena demands to come speak with them. Only after Athena promises that no harm will come to any of them, including Telegonus, does Circe agree to drop the spell. 
Athena arrives and offers Telemachus a kingdom in the west. He graciously refuses, so Athena makes the offer to Telegonus. Knowing her son will never be happy living on Aiaia, Circe reluctantly gives her blessing. Telegonus leaves, and Circe realizes she is also desperate to see the world. She summons Helios and demands to be released from exile, threatening him until he relents. Circe leaves Aiaia in Penelope’s care, and Telemachus asks to join Circe on her journey. After a long life of growing in power and wisdom, Circe finally creates a plan and a potion to turn Scylla to stone. Free from the burden that has tormented her for so long, Circe finally feels free. She and Telemachus become lovers before traveling to where she first found the magical flowers that began her witchcraft and then returning to Aiaia. With a vision of a happy mortal life with Telemachus in her mind, Circe drinks the magical sap, hoping that it will make her mortal so she can make her vision come true."
