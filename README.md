# BookFlow

BookFlow uses t

After the abstract is extracted, we use chatGPT to separate the abstract into 5 parts, each part represents a scene that can translate to a image. We then use Baseten Stable Diffusion XL to convert the text to image, then we use images will be turned into videos by Basten Stable Video Diffusion model. Due to the limitation of video length(2s), the entire video(10s) is concatenated by 5 short scenes. The background music(10s) is generated by Baseten MusicGen Large model and merge to the video.
