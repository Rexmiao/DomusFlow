# BookFlow

BookFlow is an innovative platform that transforms books into immersive video and music experiences. Our system leverages advanced technology to analyze and bring novels to life in unique and engaging ways.

## Core Features

- **Novel Metadata Database:** We've developed a robust database system, designed to store and manage novel metadata including titles, authors, genres, and summaries. This allows for efficient retrieval and management of novel information.

- **PDF-to-Text Conversion:** Our PDF-to-Text conversion tool, also part of Rexy, accurately converts novel PDFs into text format. This tool preserves the original formatting and structure, making it easier to extract key information, especially from the introductory pages of novels.

- **Data Visualization:** With the expertise of Yingjie, we employ data visualization techniques to create interactive graphs and charts. These visual representations highlight various aspects of the novels, offering insights into genres, authorship, and more.

- **Background Music Synthesis:** Led by Weiduo, we've developed an algorithm capable of analyzing the mood and tone of novel texts. This algorithm then generates corresponding background music using sophisticated audio synthesis techniques, adding an auditory layer to the reading experience.

- **Summaries, Images, and Video Generation:** Under Will's direction, our video generation system identifies key scenes or concepts from the novel text to create visually appealing videos. After extracting abstracts, we use ChatGPT to divide these abstracts into parts, each representing a scene. These scenes are then visually realized through Baseten Stable Diffusion XL, transforming text into images. Subsequently, these images are animated into videos using the Baseten Stable Video Diffusion model. Due to video length constraints, the final video comprises five short scenes, each 2 seconds long, concatenated to form a 10-second video. Background music, tailored to the video's mood and generated by the Baseten MusicGen Large model, is seamlessly merged to enhance the visual narrative.

## Expected Deliverables

- A fully functional novel database (Rexy) with a user-friendly interface for adding, editing, and retrieving novel information.
- A precise PDF-to-text conversion tool (Rexy) for effective text extraction from novel PDFs.
- A text summarization tool (Rexy) that produces accurate and concise summaries of novel texts.
- Interactive data visualization tools (Yingjie) that display novel data through distribution maps and charts.
- A background music generation system (W.W.) that creates mood-based music reflecting the novel's tone.
- Summaries, Images, and video generation system (Will) that produces visually captivating videos highlighting key novel content.

BookFlow aims to redefine the way readers experience novels, blending traditional reading with multimedia elements to create a fully immersive experience.
