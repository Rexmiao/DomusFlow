The story opens by announcing that sixteen-year-old Lydia\\u2014her parents\\u2019 favorite child\\u2014is dead, though her family doesn\\u2019t know it yet. The Lees live in Middlewood, Ohio. Marilyn, Lydia\\u2019s white mother, aspires to be a doctor. Her Chinese American father, James, is an American history professor. Her studious older brother Nathan is obsessed with space and headed to Harvard. And her sister Hannah, in fifth grade, is quietly observant and often overlooked. When Marilyn finds that Lydia missing, she is sure Lydia\\u2019s been kidnapped. Nathan thinks the neighbor Jack, a carefree loner who sleeps with a lot of girls, knows something about Lydia\\u2019s disappearance. The next day someone sees a rowboat in the middle of the town lake. The police drag the lake and find Lydia\\u2019s body.\\nThe story shifts to the 1950s and provides background about Marilyn\\u2019s and James\\u2019s wishes and concerns, including how they met, married, and ended up in Middlewood. The story returns to the present with Lydia\\u2019s funeral and the Lees looking for answers. An autopsy report determines Lydia\\u2019s cause of death is drowning with no signs of foul play. James finds solace in an affair with his teaching assistant, Louisa. The story then shifts back to when Lydia was little and Marilyn hoped to resume her studies. Closing up her mother\\u2019s house after she died, Marilyn feels even more determined not to end up like her prim 1950s housewife mother. Marilyn decides to leave her family, without explanation, to finish her studies in Toledo. That summer, a young Nathan has a humiliating experience at the pool that he blames on Jack. The event reminds James of being teased as a kid, but instead of comforting Nathan, he\\u2019s hard on him, hoping Nathan will learn how to fit in.\\nAfter Lydia\\u2019s death, the Lees grieve separately. Officer Fiske indicates that Lydia may have committed suicide because she had no friends and wasn\\u2019t doing well in school. Nathan continues to believe that Jack is connected to Lydia\\u2019s death. The story then moves back to the summer Marilyn disappeared. Lost without his wife, James barely looks after Nathan and Lydia. Nathan watches a space launch on TV that ignites his passion for space. Meanwhile, Lydia promises herself she will do whatever her mother wants if only her mother will return. In Toledo, Marilyn\\u2019s aspirations are once again disrupted by pregnancy. James comes to take her home, where she decides to pour all her frustrated ambition into Lydia. Resenting the attention Lydia gets, Nathan pushes Lydia, who can\\u2019t swim, into the lake. When he rescues her, Lydia becomes especially dependent on Nathan.\\u00a0\\nTen years later, Lydia struggles under her parents\\u2019 expectations\\u2014her mother\\u2019s desire for her to become a doctor and her father\\u2019s emphasis on having friends and fitting in. Lydia knows she is succeeding at neither. She worries about Nathan leaving her to go to college. In her physics class, which Lydia is failing, she begins a friendship with Jack. The two drive around smoking cigarettes and talking.\\nThe story shifts to after Lydia\\u2019s death. The police close the investigation, ruling Lydia\\u2019s death a suicide. Misunderstandings pull the family apart and create further rifts between Marilyn and James. James continues to find comfort with Louisa. Meanwhile, Nathan holds on to his suspicion of Jack. But Hannah is certain that Jack didn\\u2019t do anything bad because she realized a while ago that Jack is in love with Nathan. When James doesn\\u2019t come home, Marilyn goes in search of him at school and at Louisa\\u2019s.\\u00a0\\nThe story then returns to before Lydia\\u2019s death, when Lydia was spending time with Jack and Nathan was monitoring their activities from a distance. Nathan catches Lydia ripping up one of his letters from Harvard. When James gives Lydia a heart locket as an early birthday present, she feels happy at first but then sees the pictures inside\\u2014pictures of herself dressed up for a school dance that pressure her to be social and fit in\\u2014and she feels dejected and angry. On her sixteenth birthday, James and Louisa take Lydia to get her driver\\u2019s permit. In the car, Lydia realizes James is having an affair with Louisa. When she fails her permit test, Lydia blames it on the fact that she was upset, but the truth is that she just didn\\u2019t study. At home, Lydia hides the locket from James under her bed but pretends to be happy during her birthday celebration.\\nThe story returns to after Lydia\\u2019s death. James comes home and confesses to his affair. Misunderstanding and hurt, Marilyn tells James to leave. Marilyn then angrily rips apart Lydia\\u2019s room and finds her old cookbook, which makes Marilyn realize that Lydia loved her, not science. This moment breaks down Marilyn\\u2019s walls, and Hannah is finally allowed to comfort her mother and receive the affection she\\u2019s craved. Meanwhile, Nathan takes off in the car and gets drunk. On his way to Toledo, James realizes how much he has misunderstood about Marilyn. He turns the car around to go home.\\nThe story shifts back to right before Lydia\\u2019s death. Nathan goes to visit Harvard, and Lydia understands that he\\u2019s becoming a new person who will leave the family behind. To change herself, Lydia decides to lose her virginity to Jack. But Jack gently turns her down and admits to being in love with Nathan. Feeling foolish, Lydia threatens to tell Jack\\u2019s secret. Jack then stings Lydia by telling her that she doesn\\u2019t know what she wants.\\u00a0\\nAt home, Lydia tries to figure out when everything went wrong. In the middle of the night, she decides the answer is when Nathan pulled her out of the water. Wanting to start over, this time doing what she wants and not being afraid, Lydia leaves the house and goes to the lake. There, she rows out to the middle and tries to swim back to shore, even though she doesn\\u2019t know how to swim.\\u00a0\\nThe story concludes after Lydia\\u2019s death. James returns home, snuggles Hannah, and reconciles with Marilyn. Nathan sleeps after Officer Fiske delivers him home safely. The next morning at the lake, Nathan, trailed by Hannah, releases his anger and guilt about Lydia on Jack, who lets Nathan punch him. Trying to stop Nathan, Hannah pushes him into the water. Nathan wants to let himself drown but can\\u2019t. The story ends with positive references to the future and with Jack pulling Nathan from the water while Nathan keeps his eyes on Hannah\\u2019s face.\",\n          \"Bri Jackson, the narrator of the novel, is a 16-year-old girl from Garden Heights, a predominantly Black inner-city neighborhood. Bri has her sights set on rap stardom, hoping to follow in the footsteps of her late father, the underground rap star Lawless. As the novel opens, Bri is nervously awaiting the phone call that could be her big break: an invitation to perform in the Ring, a local club where up-and-coming rappers face off in \\u201cbattles.\\u201d But first, she must endure her ACT prep class at Midtown School of the Arts so she can get her confiscated phone back from her teacher. Bri\\u2019s two best friends from Garden Heights, Sonny and Malik, are in the class with her. Like many of the other students of color at Midtown Academy, they are bused in from less affluent neighborhoods.\\u00a0\\nBy the time Bri finally gets the call to battle at the Ring, both her teacher and her mother, Jay, have reminded her that school, not rap, is the key to her future. But Bri remains fixated on rap stardom as the solution to her family\\u2019s financial problems, especially after she learns that Jay, a recovering drug addict, has lost her job. Bri\\u2019s Aunt Pooh, a gang member and a drug dealer, escorts Bri to the battle at the Ring, where she squares off with Milez, another teen rapper. In the first round of the battle, Milez raps about Lawless\\u2019s murder, shocking Bri and causing her to freeze up when it is her turn to rap. But she soon recovers and outperforms Milez in the next two rounds, winning the battle decisively. By the following morning, a video of the battle is on YouTube and all Bri\\u2019s classmates are praising her for her skills.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\nBri\\u2019s celebration is short-lived, however. Tate and Long, two school security guards who have a reputation for targeting Black and Latinx students, single Bri out to have her bag searched. When Bri objects, they violently throw her to the ground and cuff her. Bri is suspended for having candy\\u2014which her principal refers to as \\\"contraband\\u2014in her backpack. The security guards are suspended too, pending an investigation, but rumors circulate around the school that Bri is a drug dealer.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\nAngry about the assault and people\\u2019s racist assumptions about her, Bri writes and records a defiant song called \\u201cOn the Come Up.\\u201d In the song, Bri rails against racist police and other authority figures. She also boasts about having a gun and being ready to use it\\u2014because that\\u2019s what people expect anyway\\u2014even though she barely knows anything about guns. Bri shares the recording with Supreme, her father\\u2019s old manager, who promises to make her famous. Supreme releases \\u201cOn the Come Up\\u201d online, where it gets picked up by a Black gossip blog and goes viral. Many of Bri\\u2019s friends love the song, but Aunt Pooh, Malik, and Trey all chastise Bri for misrepresenting herself and rapping about gang violence that she has never taken part in.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\nReal violence breaks out when Tate and Long are reinstated as the school security guards. Students of color protest outside the school while chanting some of the violent lyrics from \\u201cOn the Come Up.\\u201d When Tate and Long warn them to stop, some students attack the security guards, and a riot ensues. A local news station reports that Bri\\u2019s song incited the violence. Jay sees the newscast, learns about Bri\\u2019s song for the first time, and insists that Bri stop rapping, lay low, and focus on school. Instead, Bri takes to Instagram and is interviewed by a local radio show, defiantly claiming on both platforms that she won\\u2019t be silenced. During the radio interview, Bri has to be restrained after DJ Hype insults her with sexist taunts. Bri begins to feel as though she\\u2019s becoming the violent person that others assume she is.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\nMeanwhile, Bri\\u2019s family continues to struggle, falling behind on bills and rent. The electric company shuts off the power and the landlord threatens eviction. Jay quits school, setting aside her dreams so she can become eligible for food stamps. To make matters worse, the Crowns, a rival gang, rob Bri and Malik at gunpoint, taking her father\\u2019s gold chain. Aunt Pooh vows to get revenge on the Crowns and disappears for ten days. When she returns, Aunt Pooh is arrested in a drug bust and taken to jail while Bri looks on.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\nWith her family\\u2019s struggles in mind, Bri goes to a recording studio again, this time with Supreme. Supreme encourages Bri to embrace the persona of a \\u201choodlum\\u201d in her music because that is what people expect of Black rappers. He has another rapper write a song for Bri to record. Even though Bri does not agree with the lyrics, she reluctantly agrees to record the song, hoping to impress a white record executive.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\nBri returns to the Ring once more, where she is supposed to perform the song she recorded. Instead, Bri freestyles her own lyrics about refusing to be what people think she should be. The record executive angrily walks out, but the crowd goes wild. Later, an unnamed celebrity retweets the video of Bri\\u2019s freestyle and calls her the future of hip-hop. Bri decides that she will pursue a rap career, but only if she can do it on her own terms.\",\n          \"At the age of four, Catalina de Erauso, born in the Basque area of Spain in 1585, is placed in a Dominican convent, where she trains until the age of fifteen to become a nun. On March 18, 1600, Catalina runs away from the convent and fashions herself a suit of male clothes out of her convent garments. Thus she begins her life as a man.\\nShe obtains a number of jobs, including one as a page for the king\\u2019s secretary. While in his employ, she encounters her father, who is petitioning for help in finding his missing daughter. Her father does not recognize her. She again tempts fate and returns to her old convent for mass, where her mother is in attendance. Catalina\\u2019s mother also does not recognize her.\\nCatalina\\u2019s journeys through the New World begin when she meets her uncle, a sea captain who, not recognizing her, signs her on as a ship\\u2019s boy. Eventually Catalina flees the ship, stealing money from her uncle as she leaves for Panama, and embarks on a series of jobs and adventures. A number of violent episodes ensue, which often lead Catalina to flee into a local church for safety. At that time, police were barred from invading the sanctity of a church, thus granting criminals inside sanctuary. Catalina\\u2019s tendency to get into violent and criminal scrapes leads her to take frequent advantage of this legal loophole.\\nCatalina also has a number of problematic encounters with young ladies. Some want to marry her, forcing her to ward off their advances. But in one situation, Catalina is dismissed from her position for inappropriate behavior with the sister-in-law of her master. She signs up for the army and soon travels to Chile, where she becomes a soldier for her brother, who does not recognize her. Although they generally get along well, after three years they fight over a woman, and Catalina is banished to another town. She manages to distinguish herself in battle, both for her bravery and for her propensity for violence. She kills many people, both on and off the battlefield, and is constantly running from the law.\\nWhen a friend asks her to be his second in a duel, she agrees. During the course of the duel, she kills the other man\\u2019s second, who turns out to be her own brother. She retreats to the church to avoid arrest, and from there, wracked with sorrow, she watches her brother\\u2019s funeral. After months of hiding out in the church, Catalina leaves town and joins up with two other army deserters, who eventually die of starvation during their journey. Catalina is rescued by a half-Indian woman who wants Catalina to marry her daughter. At the same time, a local vicar tries to persuade her to marry his niece. Although she accepts their gifts, she eventually abandons them both.\\nCatalina assists in suppressing the Alonso Ib\\u00e1\\u00f1ezi uprising and is part of a bloody battle where thousands of Indians are butchered. She is accused of committing a crime that she is innocent of, and although she is tortured, she refuses to admit to it. Soon after, she is accused of a murder that she actually has committed, but she refuses to admit to this crime either. She is nearly put to death until a fellow Basque halts the execution.\\nIn Bolivia, the daughter of a nun begs Catalina to help her escape her husband, who is about to kill her for infidelity. The husband then tries to kill them both, but Catalina gets the woman to the safety of her mother\\u2019s convent. Catalina then goes to Peru to investigate crimes in the area. Soon after, she kills a man for insulting her and is sentenced to death. Due to a technicality in the church doctrine, she gains her freedom by taking communion and spitting it into her hand, holding onto the host until she is taken into a church, where she is granted sanctuary.\\nIn Lima, she joins Spanish troops who are being attacked by the Dutch and then returns to the city of Cuzco, where she gets into a bloody fight over a game of cards. She kills her opponent, \\u201cthe Cid,\\u201d who inflicts serious wounds on her as well. Thinking she is going to die, she makes a full confession to a priest.\\nAlthough she survives, she is wanted by the law. Her brushes with the constables grow more and more dangerous, and she is eventually surrounded by officers who have been given orders to kill her. A bishop intervenes and takes Catalina into the safety of his house. Catalina finally admits to the bishop that she is a woman, and when he expresses doubts, she gamely offers to submit to a medical examination. During the examination, she is proven to be not only a woman but a virgin, and the bishop vows to help her.\\nShe is sent to a nunnery while the church investigates her past to find out if she ever took vows to become a nun. Her story spreads far and wide, and by 1620 she is well known throughout Spain. When, two years later, it is confirmed that she never took her vows, she is allowed to leave the convent and begin her life as a Spanish celebrity. She goes to Madrid and presents herself to the king, who, in 1625, grants her a pension for her service to Spain.\\nCatalina travels to Rome, where she meets Pope Urban the Eighth and tells him about her life and travels. She tells him that she is a woman and a virgin, and he gives her permission to continue to dress in men\\u2019s clothing.\\nCatalina ends her memoir with a short tale about being confronted by two prostitutes, whom she insults because they address her as a woman.\"\n        ],\n        \"num_unique_values\": 191,\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n

Smith is a low-ranking member of the ruling Party in London, in the nation of Oceania. Everywhere Winston goes, even his own home, the Party watches him through telescreens; everywhere he looks he sees the face of the Party‚Äôs seemingly omniscient leader, a figure known only as Big Brother. The Party controls everything in Oceania, even the people‚Äôs history and language. Currently, the Party is forcing the implementation of an invented language called Newspeak, which attempts to prevent political rebellion by eliminating all words related to it. Even thinking rebellious thoughts is illegal. Such thoughtcrime is, in fact, the worst of all crimes.\n","As the novel opens, Winston feels frustrated by the oppression and rigid control of the Party, which prohibits free thought, sex, and any expression of individuality. Winston dislikes the party and has illegally purchased a diary in which to write his criminal thoughts. He has also become fixated on a powerful Party member named O‚ÄôBrien, whom Winston believes is a secret member of the Brotherhood‚Äîthe mysterious, legendary group that works to overthrow the Party.\n","Winston works in the Ministry of Truth, where he alters historical records to fit the needs of the Party. He notices a coworker, a beautiful dark-haired girl, staring at him, and worries that she is an informant who will turn him in for his thoughtcrime. He is troubled by the Party‚Äôs control of history: the Party claims that Oceania has always been allied with Eastasia in a war against Eurasia, but Winston seems to recall a time when this was not true. The Party also claims that Emmanuel Goldstein, the alleged leader of the Brotherhood, is the most dangerous man alive, but this does not seem plausible to Winston. Winston spends his evenings wandering through the poorest neighborhoods in London, where the proletarians, or proles, live squalid lives, relatively free of Party monitoring.\n","One day, Winston receives a note from the dark-haired girl that reads ‚ÄúI love you.‚Äù She tells him her name, Julia, and they begin a covert affair, always on the lookout for signs of Party monitoring. Eventually they rent a room above the secondhand store in the prole district where Winston bought the diary. This relationship lasts for some time. Winston is sure that they will be caught and punished sooner or later (the fatalistic Winston knows that he has been doomed since he wrote his first diary entry), while Julia is more pragmatic and optimistic. As Winston‚Äôs affair with Julia progresses, his hatred for the Party grows more and more intense. At last, he receives the message that he has been waiting for: O‚ÄôBrien wants to see him.\n","Winston and Julia travel to O‚ÄôBrien‚Äôs luxurious apartment. As a member of the powerful Inner Party (Winston belongs to the Outer Party), O‚ÄôBrien leads a life of luxury that Winston can only imagine. O‚ÄôBrien confirms to Winston and Julia that, like them, he hates the Party, and says that he works against it as a member of the Brotherhood. He indoctrinates Winston and Julia into the Brotherhood, and gives Winston a copy of Emmanuel Goldstein‚Äôs book, the manifesto of the Brotherhood. Winston reads the book‚Äîan amalgam of several forms of class-based twentieth-century social theory‚Äîto Julia in the room above the store. Suddenly, soldiers barge in and seize them. Mr. Charrington, the proprietor of the store, is revealed as having been a member of the Thought Police all along.\n","Torn away from Julia and taken to a place called the Ministry of Love, Winston finds that O‚ÄôBrien, too, is a Party spy who simply pretended to be a member of the Brotherhood in order to trap Winston into committing an open act of rebellion against the Party. O‚ÄôBrien spends months torturing and brainwashing Winston, who struggles to resist. At last, O‚ÄôBrien sends him to the dreaded Room 101, the final destination for anyone who opposes the Party. Here, O‚ÄôBrien tells Winston that he will be forced to confront his worst fear. Throughout the novel, Winston has had recurring nightmares about rats; O‚ÄôBrien now straps a cage full of rats onto Winston‚Äôs head and prepares to allow the rats to eat his face. Winston snaps, pleading with O‚ÄôBrien to do it to Julia, not to him.\n","Giving up Julia is what O‚ÄôBrien wanted from Winston all along. His spirit broken, Winston is released to the outside world. He meets Julia but no longer feels anything for her. He has accepted the Party entirely and has learned to love Big Brother.\n"]}]}]}
