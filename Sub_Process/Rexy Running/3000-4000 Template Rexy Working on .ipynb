The Green Knight says that he will allow whomever accepts the challenge to strike him with his own axe, on the condition that the challenger find him in exactly one year to receive a blow in return.\\nStunned, Arthur hesitates to respond, but when the Green Knight mocks Arthur\\u2019s silence, the king steps forward to take the challenge. As soon as Arthur grips the Green Knight\\u2019s axe, Sir Gawain leaps up and asks to take the challenge himself. He takes hold of the axe and, in one deadly blow, cuts off the knight\\u2019s head. To the amazement of the court, the now-headless Green Knight picks up his severed head. Before riding away, the head reiterates the terms of the pact, reminding the young Gawain to seek him in a year and a day at the Green Chapel. After the Green Knight leaves, the company goes back to its festival, but Gawain is uneasy.\\nTime passes, and autumn arrives. On the Day of All Saints, Gawain prepares to leave Camelot and find the Green Knight. He puts on his best armor, mounts his horse, Gringolet, and starts off toward North Wales, traveling through the wilderness of northwest Britain. Gawain encounters all sorts of beasts, suffers from hunger and cold, and grows more desperate as the days pass. On Christmas Day, he prays to find a place to hear Mass, then looks up to see a castle shimmering in the distance. The lord of the castle welcomes Gawain warmly, introducing him to his lady and to the old woman who sits beside her. For sport, the host (whose name is later revealed to be Bertilak) strikes a deal with Gawain: the host will go out hunting with his men every day, and when he returns in the evening, he will exchange his winnings for anything Gawain has managed to acquire by staying behind at the castle. Gawain happily agrees to the pact, and goes to bed.\\nThe first day, the lord hunts a herd of does, while Gawain sleeps late in his bedchambers. On the morning of the first day, the lord\\u2019s wife sneaks into Gawain\\u2019s chambers and attempts to seduce him. Gawain puts her off, but before she leaves she steals one kiss from him. That evening, when the host gives Gawain the venison he has captured, Gawain kisses him, since he has won one kiss from the lady. The second day, the lord hunts a wild boar. The lady again enters Gawain\\u2019s chambers, and this time she kisses Gawain twice. That evening Gawain gives the host the two kisses in exchange for the boar\\u2019s head.\\nThe third day, the lord hunts a fox, and the lady kisses Gawain three times. She also asks him for a love token, such as a ring or a glove. Gawain refuses to give her anything and refuses to take anything from her, until the lady mentions her girdle. The green silk girdle she wears around her waist is no ordinary piece of cloth, the lady claims, but possesses the magical ability to protect the person who wears it from death. Intrigued, Gawain accepts the cloth, but when it comes time to exchange his winnings with the host, Gawain gives the three kisses but does not mention the lady\\u2019s green girdle. The host gives Gawain the fox skin he won that day, and they all go to bed happy, but weighed down with the fact that Gawain must leave for the Green Chapel the following morning to find the Green Knight.\\nNew Year\\u2019s Day arrives, and Gawain dons his armor, including the girdle, then sets off with Gringolet to seek the Green Knight. A guide accompanies him out of the estate grounds. When they reach the border of the forest, the guide promises not to tell anyone if Gawain decides to give up the quest. Gawain refuses, determined to meet his fate head-on. Eventually, he comes to a kind of crevice in a rock, visible through the tall grasses. He hears the whirring of a grindstone, confirming his suspicion that this strange cavern is in fact the Green Chapel. Gawain calls out, and the Green Knight emerges to greet him. Intent on fulfilling the terms of the contract, Gawain presents his neck to the Green Knight, who proceeds to feign two blows. On the third feint, the Green Knight nicks Gawain\\u2019s neck, barely drawing blood. Angered, Gawain shouts that their contract has been met, but the Green Knight merely laughs.\\nThe Green Knight reveals his name, Bertilak, and explains that he is the lord of the castle where Gawain recently stayed. Because Gawain did not honestly exchange all of his winnings on the third day, Bertilak drew blood on his third blow. Nevertheless, Gawain has proven himself a worthy knight, without equal in all the land. When Gawain questions Bertilak further, Bertilak explains that the old woman at the castle is really Morgan le Fay, Gawain\\u2019s aunt and King Arthur\\u2019s half sister. She sent the Green Knight on his original errand and used her magic to change Bertilak\\u2019s appearance. Relieved to be alive but extremely guilty about his sinful failure to tell the whole truth, Gawain wears the girdle on his arm as a reminder of his own failure. He returns to Arthur\\u2019s court, where all the knights join Gawain, wearing girdles on their arms to show their support.\",\n          \"All Quiet on the Western Front is narrated by Paul B\\u00e4umer, a young man of nineteen who fights in the German army on the French front in World War I. Paul and several of his friends from school joined the army voluntarily after listening to the stirring patriotic speeches of their teacher, Kantorek. But after experiencing ten weeks of brutal training at the hands of the petty, cruel Corporal Himmelstoss and the unimaginable brutality of life on the front, Paul and his friends have realized that the ideals of nationalism and patriotism for which they enlisted are simply empty clich\\u00e9s. They no longer believe that war is glorious or honorable, and they live in constant physical terror.\\nWhen Paul\\u2019s company receives a short reprieve after two weeks of fighting, only eighty men of the original 150-man company return from the front. The cook doesn\\u2019t want to give the survivors the rations that were meant for the dead men but eventually agrees to do so; the men thus enjoy a large meal. Paul and his friends visit Kemmerich, a former classmate who has recently had a leg amputated after contracting gangrene. Kemmerich is slowly dying, and M\\u00fcller, another former classmate, wants Kemmerich\\u2019s boots for himself. Paul doesn\\u2019t consider M\\u00fcller insensitive; like the other soldiers, M\\u00fcller simply realizes pragmatically that Kemmerich no longer needs his boots. Surviving the agony of war, Paul observes, forces one to learn to disconnect oneself from emotions like grief, sympathy, and fear. Not long after this encounter, Paul returns to Kemmerich\\u2019s bedside just as the young man dies. At Kemmerich\\u2019s request, Paul takes his boots to M\\u00fcller.\\nA group of new recruits comes to reinforce the company, and Paul\\u2019s friend Kat produces a beef and bean stew that impresses them. Kat says that if all the men in an army, including the officers, were paid the same wage and given the same food, wars would be over immediately. Kropp, another of Paul\\u2019s former classmates, says that there should be no armies; he argues that a nation\\u2019s leaders should instead fight out their disagreements with clubs. They discuss the fact that petty, insignificant people become powerful and arrogant during war, and Tjaden, a member of Paul\\u2019s company, announces that the cruel Corporal Himmelstoss has come to fight at the front.\\nAt night, the men go on a harrowing mission to lay barbed wire at the front. Pounded by artillery, they hide in a graveyard, where the force of the shelling causes the buried corpses to emerge from their graves, as groups of living men fall dead around them. After this gruesome event, the surviving soldiers return to their camp, where they kill lice and think about what they will do at the end of the war. Some of the men have tentative plans, but all of them seem to feel that the war will never end. Paul fears that if the war did end, he wouldn\\u2019t know what to do with himself. Himmelstoss arrives at the front; when the men see him, Tjaden insults him. The men\\u2019s lieutenant gives them light punishment but also lectures Himmelstoss about the futility of saluting at the front. Paul and Kat find a house with a goose and roast the goose for supper, enjoying a rare good meal.\\nThe company is caught in a bloody battle with a charging group of Allied infantrymen. Men are blown apart, limbs are severed from torsos, and giant rats pick at the dead and the wounded. Paul feels that he must become an animal in battle, trusting only his instincts to keep him alive. After the battle, only thirty-two of eighty men are still alive. The men are given a short reprieve at a field depot. Paul and some of his friends go for a swim, which ends in a rendezvous with a group of French girls. Paul desperately wishes to recapture his innocence with a girl, but he feels that it is impossible to do so.\\nPaul receives seventeen days of leave and goes home to see his family. He feels awkward and oppressed in his hometown, unable to discuss his traumatic experiences with anyone. He learns that his mother is dying of cancer and that Kantorek has been conscripted as a soldier, from which he derives a certain cold satisfaction. He visits Kemmerich\\u2019s mother and tells her, untruthfully, that her son\\u2019s death was instant and painless. At the end of his leave, Paul spends some time at a training camp near a group of Russian prisoners-of-war. Paul feels that the Russians are people just like him, not subhuman enemies, and wonders how war can make enemies of people who have no grudge against one another.\\nPaul is sent back to his company and is reunited with his friends. The kaiser, the German emperor, pays a visit to the front, and the men are disappointed to see that he is merely a short man with a weak voice. In battle, Paul is separated from his company and forced to hide in a shell hole. A French soldier jumps into the shell hole with him, and Paul instinctively stabs him. As the man dies a slow, painful death, Paul is overcome with remorse for having hurt him. He feels again that this enemy soldier is no enemy at all but rather a victim of war just like himself. Paul looks through the soldier\\u2019s things and finds that his name was G\\u00e9rard Duval and learns that Duval had a wife and child at home. When he returns to his company, Paul recounts the incident to his friends, who try to console him.\\nPaul and his friends are given an easy assignment: for three weeks, they are to guard a supply depot away from the fighting. When the next battle takes place, Paul and Kropp are wounded and forced to bribe a sergeant-major with cigars in order to be placed on the hospital train together. At the hospital, Paul undergoes surgery. Kropp\\u2019s leg is amputated, and he becomes extremely depressed. After his surgery, Paul has a short leave at home before he returns to his company.\\nAs the German army begins to give in to the unrelenting pressure of the Allied forces, Paul\\u2019s friends are killed in combat one by one. Detering, one of Paul\\u2019s close friends, attempts to desert but is caught and court-martialed. Kat is killed when a piece of shrapnel slices his head open while Paul is carrying him to safety. By the fall of 1918, Paul is the only one of his circle of friends who is still alive. Soldiers everywhere whisper that the Germans will soon surrender and that peace will come. Paul is poisoned in a gas attack and given a short leave. He reflects that, when the war ends, he will be ruined for peacetime; all he knows is the war. In October 1918, on a day with very little fighting, Paul is killed. The army report for that day reads simply: \\u201cAll quiet on the Western Front.\\u201d Paul\\u2019s corpse wears a calm expression, as though relieved that the end has come at last.\",\n          \"After being out to sea for six months without seeing land, the whaling ship The Dolly stops in the Marquesas Islands located in the South Pacific. Tired of a life of drudgery and abuse on board, the narrator, later called Tommo, decides to flee the ship with a fellow shipmate, Toby. The two men plan to hide on the island of Nukuheva, eating tropical fruits until they can catch a ride on a better boat. They must be careful while hiding, though, since the island is partially populated by the Typees, a violent tribe known for being cannibals.\\nThe two men make their escape while the crew is on shore leave. After spending several cold and wet nights on the island mountain, Tommo and Toby spot a beautiful valley below. They are hungry, cold, and Tommo also feels feverish due to an injury to his leg. They decide to descend into the valley even though they are not sure if it is the home of the friendly Happar tribe or that of the dreaded Typee. After a dangerous descent, which involves scaling a steep ravine and jumping onto a tree from a cliff above, the two men are in the heart of the valley. They spot a tree of tropical fruit and then a young native man and woman.\\nBecause of their desperation, they approach the natives and offer them a piece of calico cloth. Initially, Toby and Tommo happily think that the natives are Happars, not Typees. After arriving in their nearby village however, a stern chief, Mehevi, asks Tommo, \\\"Typee\\\" or \\\"Happar\\\"? Knowing that he must choose correctly, Tommo suddenly changes his mind and says \\\"Typee.\\\" His guess is right and the surrounding natives start chattering happily. The Typees offer Tommo and Toby food and a place to sleep. Mehevi orders a man named Kory-Kory to be Tommo's servant. Tommo immediately feels deeply attracted to a beautiful maiden named Fayaway.\\nIn their initial days with the Typees, Tommo quickly learns to enjoy the pleasures of their lifestyle. Kory-Kory feeds Tommo by hand, carries him everywhere due to his injured leg, and bathes him each morning in the nearby stream. Despite the Typees's hospitality though, neither Toby nor Tommo is entirely free from their fear about cannibalism. When they are served meat for the first time, Toby instantly declares that it is roast human baby and refuses to eat it. Tommo later discovers that it is actually roast pork, but he still remains apprehensive that the Typees plan to do him harm.\\nTommo's leg injury also continues to be painful and crippling. Eventually, Toby starts for Nukuheva to get Tommo some European medicine, but has to turn back after an altercation with nearby Happars. Soon after, some foreign ships appear in the Typee Bay and Toby goes with the Typees to greet them. He never returns and Tommo is given only inconclusive answers about where he went. Tommo occasionally worries that the Typees killed and ate Toby, since he has no other explanation.\\nWith time though, Tommo begins to relax and truly enjoy Typee life. As he does so, his leg heals. He spends his days walking with Fayaway or Kory-Kory. He bathes in the morning with a group of half-dressed maidens, sleeps much of the day, and chats with Mehevi at the Ti, a religious location reserved only for men. Tommo describes the Typee culture in depth, including their religious, marital, and social practices. He believes that the Typees are more civilized than Europeans and Americans, even though the latter call natives \\\"savages.\\\" Actually, Tommo finds that natives live with more honesty, truth, and goodness than Europeans. Their one major flaw is that they sometimes act as cannibals, but many European cultures have engaged in comparably brutal acts, Tommo notes.\\nDespite Tommo's happiness, he still worries about the Typees's intentions towards him. When the Typees express a desire to tattoo him, Tommo becomes terribly distressed at the thought and it is only through extensive begging that the tattooing is not enforced. The pressure to be tattooed hastens Tommo's desire to escape. This desire is reinforced when Tommo sees the natives holding three shrunken human heads, one of which belongs to a white man. Soon after, Tommo positively learns that the Typees are cannibals. After a battle with the Happars, a feast is held from which Tommo is carefully excluded. Later, though, he sees part of a half-eaten body and knows that the Typees ate the dead Happars. He then thinks about escape constantly.\\nTommo's escape comes when a Nukuheva native, Karakoee, comes to the Typee Bay trying to buy Tommo's freedom for an Australian whaling captain. When the natives are not paying close attention, Tommo leaps towards Karakoee and they start rowing away. Several native men swim after them in an effort to overturn their boat, but Tommo disables one of the ferocious chiefs, Mow-Mow, with a forceful blow. Tommo and Karakoee make their escape. When he knows he is free, Tommo faints. Later, however, he entertains his new crew on the Australian ship with tales of his adventures.\\nIn the sequel \\\"The Story of Toby,\\\" Toby's mysterious disappearance is explained. He disappeared when a European resident of Nukuheva, Jimmy, arrived and negotiated for his freedom. Toby believed that Jimmy truly wanted to help him, but Jimmy actually was simply working for a whaling ship in need of a crew. After they reached Nukuheva, Toby learned that no one would go back for Tommo as they had promised. He was forced to leave on the ship. Until the publication of Typee, he had believed that his friend, the narrator, was dead.\"\n        ],\n        \"num_unique_values\": 253,\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\":

Smith is a low-ranking member of the ruling Party in London, in the nation of Oceania. Everywhere Winston goes, even his own home, the Party watches him through telescreens; everywhere he looks he sees the face of the Party‚Äôs seemingly omniscient leader, a figure known only as Big Brother. The Party controls everything in Oceania, even the people‚Äôs history and language. Currently, the Party is forcing the implementation of an invented language called Newspeak, which attempts to prevent political rebellion by eliminating all words related to it. Even thinking rebellious thoughts is illegal. Such thoughtcrime is, in fact, the worst of all crimes.\n","As the novel opens, Winston feels frustrated by the oppression and rigid control of the Party, which prohibits free thought, sex, and any expression of individuality. Winston dislikes the party and has illegally purchased a diary in which to write his criminal thoughts. He has also become fixated on a powerful Party member named O‚ÄôBrien, whom Winston believes is a secret member of the Brotherhood‚Äîthe mysterious, legendary group that works to overthrow the Party.\n","Winston works in the Ministry of Truth, where he alters historical records to fit the needs of the Party. He notices a coworker, a beautiful dark-haired girl, staring at him, and worries that she is an informant who will turn him in for his thoughtcrime. He is troubled by the Party‚Äôs control of history: the Party claims that Oceania has always been allied with Eastasia in a war against Eurasia, but Winston seems to recall a time when this was not true. The Party also claims that Emmanuel Goldstein, the alleged leader of the Brotherhood, is the most dangerous man alive, but this does not seem plausible to Winston. Winston spends his evenings wandering through the poorest neighborhoods in London, where the proletarians, or proles, live squalid lives, relatively free of Party monitoring.\n","One day, Winston receives a note from the dark-haired girl that reads ‚ÄúI love you.‚Äù She tells him her name, Julia, and they begin a covert affair, always on the lookout for signs of Party monitoring. Eventually they rent a room above the secondhand store in the prole district where Winston bought the diary. This relationship lasts for some time. Winston is sure that they will be caught and punished sooner or later (the fatalistic Winston knows that he has been doomed since he wrote his first diary entry), while Julia is more pragmatic and optimistic. As Winston‚Äôs affair with Julia progresses, his hatred for the Party grows more and more intense. At last, he receives the message that he has been waiting for: O‚ÄôBrien wants to see him.\n","Winston and Julia travel to O‚ÄôBrien‚Äôs luxurious apartment. As a member of the powerful Inner Party (Winston belongs to the Outer Party), O‚ÄôBrien leads a life of luxury that Winston can only imagine. O‚ÄôBrien confirms to Winston and Julia that, like them, he hates the Party, and says that he works against it as a member of the Brotherhood. He indoctrinates Winston and Julia into the Brotherhood, and gives Winston a copy of Emmanuel Goldstein‚Äôs book, the manifesto of the Brotherhood. Winston reads the book‚Äîan amalgam of several forms of class-based twentieth-century social theory‚Äîto Julia in the room above the store. Suddenly, soldiers barge in and seize them. Mr. Charrington, the proprietor of the store, is revealed as having been a member of the Thought Police all along.\n","Torn away from Julia and taken to a place called the Ministry of Love, Winston finds that O‚ÄôBrien, too, is a Party spy who simply pretended to be a member of the Brotherhood in order to trap Winston into committing an open act of rebellion against the Party. O‚ÄôBrien spends months torturing and brainwashing Winston, who struggles to resist. At last, O‚ÄôBrien sends him to the dreaded Room 101, the final destination for anyone who opposes the Party. Here, O‚ÄôBrien tells Winston that he will be forced to confront his worst fear. Throughout the novel, Winston has had recurring nightmares about rats; O‚ÄôBrien now straps a cage full of rats onto Winston‚Äôs head and prepares to allow the rats to eat his face. Winston snaps, pleading with O‚ÄôBrien to do it to Julia, not to him.\n","Giving up Julia is what O‚ÄôBrien wanted from Winston all along. His spirit broken, Winston is released to the outside world. He meets Julia but no longer feels anything for her. He has accepted the Party entirely and has learned to love Big Brother.\n"]}]}]}
