Title,Abstract
Comprehensively,"The narrator begins telling his story with the claim that he is an “invisible man.” His invisibility, he says, is not a physical condition—he is not literally invisible—but is rather the result of the refusal of others to see him. He says that because of his invisibility, he has been hiding from the world, living underground and stealing electricity from the Monopolated Light & Power Company. He burns 1,369 light bulbs simultaneously and listens to Louis Armstrong’s “(What Did I Do to Be So) Black and Blue” on a phonograph. He says that he has gone underground in order to write the story of his life and invisibility.
As a young man, in the late 1920s or early 1930s, the narrator lived in the South. Because he is a gifted public speaker, he is invited to give a speech to a group of important white men in his town. The men reward him with a briefcase containing a scholarship to a prestigious Black college, but only after humiliating him by forcing him to fight in a “battle royal” in which he is pitted against other young Black men, all blindfolded, in a boxing ring. After the battle royal, the white men force the youths to scramble over an electrified rug in order to snatch at fake gold coins. The narrator has a dream that night in which he imagines that his scholarship is actually a piece of paper with a crude command to keep him running.
Three years later, the narrator is a student at the college. He is asked to drive a wealthy white trustee of the college, Mr. Norton, around the campus. Norton talks incessantly about his daughter, then shows an undue interest in the narrative of Jim Trueblood, a poor, uneducated Black man who impregnated his own daughter. After hearing this story, Norton needs a drink, and the narrator takes him to the Golden Day, a saloon and brothel that normally serves Black men. A fight breaks out among a group of Black veterans at the bar, and Norton passes out during the chaos. He is tended by one of the veterans, who claims to be a doctor and who taunts both Norton and the narrator for their blindness regarding race relations.
Back at the college, the narrator listens to a long, impassioned sermon by the Reverend Homer A. Barbee on the subject of the college’s Founder, whom the blind Barbee glorifies with poetic language. After the sermon, the narrator is chastised by the college president, Dr. Bledsoe, who has learned of the narrator’s misadventures with Norton at the old slave quarters and the Golden Day. Bledsoe rebukes the narrator, saying that he should have shown the white man an idealized version of Black life. He expels the narrator, giving him seven letters of recommendation addressed to the college’s white trustees in New York City, and sends him there in search of a job.
The narrator travels to the bright lights and bustle of 1930s Harlem, where he looks unsuccessfully for work. The letters of recommendation are of no help. At last, the narrator goes to the office of one of his letters’ addressees, a trustee named Mr. Emerson. There he meets Emerson’s son, who opens the letter and tells the narrator that he has been betrayed: the letters from Bledsoe actually portray the narrator as dishonorable and unreliable. The young Emerson helps the narrator to get a low-paying job at the Liberty Paints plant, whose trademark color is “Optic White.” The narrator briefly serves as an assistant to Lucius Brockway, the Black man who makes this white paint, but Brockway suspects him of joining in union activities and turns on him. The two men fight, neglecting the paint-making; consequently, one of the unattended tanks explodes, and the narrator is knocked unconscious.
The narrator wakes in the paint factory’s hospital, having temporarily lost his memory and ability to speak. The white doctors seize the arrival of their unidentified black patient as an opportunity to conduct electric shock experiments. After the narrator recovers his memory and leaves the hospital, he collapses on the street. Some black community members take him to the home of Mary, a kind woman who lets him live with her for free in Harlem and nurtures his sense of Black heritage. One day, the narrator witnesses the eviction of an elderly Black couple from their Harlem apartment. Standing before the crowd of people gathered before the apartment, he gives an impassioned speech against the eviction. Brother Jack overhears his speech and offers him a position as a spokesman for the Brotherhood, a political organization that allegedly works to help the socially oppressed. After initially rejecting the offer, the narrator takes the job in order to pay Mary back for her hospitality. But the Brotherhood demands that the narrator take a new name, break with his past, and move to a new apartment. The narrator is inducted into the Brotherhood at a party at the Chthonian Hotel and is placed in charge of advancing the group’s goals in Harlem.
After being trained in rhetoric by a white member of the group named Brother Hambro, the narrator goes to his assigned branch in Harlem, where he meets the handsome, intelligent black youth leader Tod Clifton. He also becomes familiar with the Black nationalist leader Ras the Exhorter, who opposes the interracial Brotherhood and believes that Black Americans should fight for their rights over and against all whites. The narrator delivers speeches and becomes a high-profile figure in the Brotherhood, and he enjoys his work. One day, however, he receives an anonymous note warning him to remember his place as a Black man in the Brotherhood. Not long after, the Black Brotherhood member Brother Wrestrum accuses the narrator of trying to use the Brotherhood to advance a selfish desire for personal distinction. While a committee of the Brotherhood investigates the charges, the organization moves the narrator to another post, as an advocate of women’s rights. After giving a speech one evening, he is seduced by one of the white women at the gathering, who attempts to use him to play out her sexual fantasies about Black men.
After a short time, the Brotherhood sends the narrator back to Harlem, where he discovers that Clifton has disappeared. Many other Black members have left the group, as much of the Harlem community feels that the Brotherhood has betrayed their interests. The narrator finds Clifton on the street selling dancing “Sambo” dolls—dolls that invoke the stereotype of the lazy and obsequious slave. Clifton apparently does not have a permit to sell his wares on the street. White policemen accost him and, after a scuffle, shoot him dead as the narrator and others look on. On his own initiative, the narrator holds a funeral for Clifton and gives a speech in which he portrays his dead friend as a hero, galvanizing public sentiment in Clifton’s favor. The Brotherhood is furious with him for staging the funeral without permission, and Jack harshly castigates him. As Jack rants about the Brotherhood’s ideological stance, a glass eye falls from one of his eye sockets. The Brotherhood sends the narrator back to Brother Hambro to learn about the organization’s new strategies in Harlem.
The narrator leaves feeling furious and anxious to gain revenge on Jack and the Brotherhood. He arrives in Harlem to find the neighborhood in ever-increased agitation over race relations. Ras confronts him, deploring the Brotherhood’s failure to draw on the momentum generated by Clifton’s funeral. Ras sends his men to beat up the narrator, and the narrator is forced to disguise himself in dark glasses and a hat. In his dark glasses, many people on the streets mistake him for someone named Rinehart, who seems to be a pimp, bookie, lover, and reverend all at once. At last, the narrator goes to Brother Hambro’s apartment, where Hambro tells him that the Brotherhood has chosen not to emphasize Harlem and the Black movement. He cynically declares that people are merely tools and that the larger interests of the Brotherhood are more important than any individual. Recalling advice given to him by his grandfather, the narrator determines to undermine the Brotherhood by seeming to go along with them completely. He decides to flatter and seduce a woman close to one of the party leaders in order to obtain secret information about the group.
But the woman he chooses, Sybil, knows nothing about the Brotherhood and attempts to use the narrator to fulfill her fantasy of being raped by a Black man. While still with Sybil in his apartment, the narrator receives a call asking him to come to Harlem quickly. The narrator hears the sound of breaking glass, and the line goes dead. He arrives in Harlem to find the neighborhood in the midst of a full-fledged riot, which he learns was incited by Ras. The narrator becomes involved in setting fire to a tenement building. Running from the scene of the crime, he encounters Ras, dressed as an African chieftain. Ras calls for the narrator to be lynched. The narrator flees, only to encounter two policemen, who suspect that his briefcase contains loot from the riots. In his attempt to evade them, the narrator falls down a manhole. The police mock him and draw the cover over the manhole.
The narrator says that he has stayed underground ever since; the end of his story is also the beginning. He states that he finally has realized that he must honor his individual complexity and remain true to his own identity without sacrificing his responsibility to the community. He says that he finally feels ready to emerge from underground."
Animated,Video SparkNotes: A Summary of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
Eloquence,"In a series of letters, Robert Walton, the captain of a ship bound for the North Pole, recounts to his sister back in England the progress of his dangerous mission. Successful early on, the mission is soon interrupted by seas full of impassable ice. Trapped, Walton encounters Victor Frankenstein, who has been traveling by dog-drawn sledge across the ice and is weakened by the cold. Walton takes him aboard ship, helps nurse him back to health, and hears the fantastic tale of the monster that Frankenstein created.
Victor first describes his early life in Geneva. At the end of a blissful childhood spent in the company of Elizabeth Lavenza (his cousin in the 1818 edition, his adopted sister in the 1831 edition) and friend Henry Clerval, Victor enters the university of Ingolstadt to study natural philosophy and chemistry. There, he is consumed by the desire to discover the secret of life and, after several years of research, becomes convinced that he has found it.
Armed with the knowledge he has long been seeking, Victor spends months feverishly fashioning a creature out of old body parts. One climactic night, in the secrecy of his apartment, he brings his creation to life. When he looks at the monstrosity that he has created, however, the sight horrifies him. After a fitful night of sleep, interrupted by the specter of the monster looming over him, he runs into the streets, eventually wandering in remorse. Victor runs into Henry, who has come to study at the university, and he takes his friend back to his apartment. Though the monster is gone, Victor falls into a feverish illness.
Sickened by his horrific deed, Victor prepares to return to Geneva, to his family, and to health. Just before departing Ingolstadt, however, he receives a letter from his father informing him that his youngest brother, William, has been murdered. Grief-stricken, Victor hurries home. While passing through the woods where William was strangled, he catches sight of the monster and becomes convinced that the monster is his brother’s murderer. Arriving in Geneva, Victor finds that Justine Moritz, a kind, gentle girl who had been adopted by the Frankenstein household, has been accused. She is tried, condemned, and executed, despite her assertions of innocence. Victor grows despondent, guilty with the knowledge that the monster he has created bears responsibility for the death of two innocent loved ones.
Hoping to ease his grief, Victor takes a vacation to the mountains. While he is alone one day, crossing an enormous glacier, the monster approaches him. The monster admits to the murder of William but begs for understanding. Lonely, shunned, and forlorn, he says that he struck out at William in a desperate attempt to injure Victor, his cruel creator. The monster begs Victor to create a mate for him, a monster equally grotesque to serve as his sole companion.
Victor refuses at first, horrified by the prospect of creating a second monster. The monster is eloquent and persuasive, however, and he eventually convinces Victor. After returning to Geneva, Victor heads for England, accompanied by Henry, to gather information for the creation of a female monster. Leaving Henry in Scotland, he secludes himself on a desolate island in the Orkneys and works reluctantly at repeating his first success. One night, struck by doubts about the morality of his actions, Victor glances out the window to see the monster glaring in at him with a frightening grin. Horrified by the possible consequences of his work, Victor destroys his new creation. The monster, enraged, vows revenge, swearing that he will be with Victor on Victor’s wedding night.
Later that night, Victor takes a boat out onto a lake and dumps the remains of the second creature in the water. The wind picks up and prevents him from returning to the island. In the morning, he finds himself ashore near an unknown town. Upon landing, he is arrested and informed that he will be tried for a murder discovered the previous night. Victor denies any knowledge of the murder, but when shown the body, he is shocked to behold his friend Henry Clerval, with the mark of the monster’s fingers on his neck. Victor falls ill, raving and feverish, and is kept in prison until his recovery, after which he is acquitted of the crime.
Shortly after returning to Geneva with his father, Victor marries Elizabeth. He fears the monster’s warning and suspects that he will be murdered on his wedding night. To be cautious, he sends Elizabeth away to wait for him. While he awaits the monster, he hears Elizabeth scream and realizes that the monster had been hinting at killing his new bride, not himself. Victor returns home to his father, who dies of grief a short time later. Victor vows to devote the rest of his life to finding the monster and exacting his revenge, and he soon departs to begin his quest.
Victor tracks the monster ever northward into the ice. In a dogsled chase, Victor almost catches up with the monster, but the sea beneath them swells and the ice breaks, leaving an unbridgeable gap between them. At this point, Walton encounters Victor, and the narrative catches up to the time of Walton’s fourth letter to his sister.
Walton tells the remainder of the story in another series of letters to his sister. Victor, already ill when the two men meet, worsens and dies shortly thereafter. When Walton returns, several days later, to the room in which the body lies, he is startled to see the monster weeping over Victor. The monster tells Walton of his immense solitude, suffering, hatred, and remorse. He asserts that now that his creator has died, he too can end his suffering. The monster then departs for the northernmost ice to die."
Freer,"Frederick Douglass was born into slavery sometime in 1817 or 1818. Like many enslaved people, he is unsure of his exact date of birth. Douglass is separated from his mother, Harriet Bailey, soon after he is born. His father is most likely their white master, Captain Anthony. Captain Anthony is the clerk of a rich man named Colonel Lloyd. Lloyd enslaves hundreds of men, women, and children, who call his large, central plantation the “Great House Farm.” Life on any of Lloyd’s plantations, like that on many Southern plantations, is brutal. Those enslaved are overworked and exhausted, receive little food, few articles of clothing, and no beds. Those who break rules—and even those who do not—are beaten or whipped, and sometimes even shot by the plantation overseers, the cruelest of which are Mr. Severe and Mr. Austin Gore. 
Douglass’s life on this plantation is not as hard as that of most of the others. Being a child, he serves in the household instead of in the fields. At the age of seven, he is given to Captain Anthony’s son‑in‑law’s brother, Hugh Auld, who lives in Baltimore. In Baltimore, Douglass enjoys a relatively freer life. In general, city slave-owners are more conscious of appearing cruel or neglectful toward those they enslave in front of their non‑slaveowning neighbors.
Sophia Auld, Hugh’s wife, has never ""owned"" enslaved people before, and therefore she is surprisingly kind to Douglass at first. She even begins to teach Douglass to read, until her husband orders her to stop, saying that education makes enslaved people unmanageable. Eventually, Sophia succumbs to the mentality of slaveowning and loses her natural kindliness. Though Sophia and Hugh Auld become crueler toward him, Douglass still likes Baltimore and is able to teach himself to read with the help of local boys. As he learns to read and write, Douglass becomes conscious of the evils of slavery and of the existence of the abolitionist, or antislavery, movement. He resolves to escape to the North eventually.
After the deaths of Captain Anthony and his remaining heirs, Douglass is taken back to serve Thomas Auld, Captain Anthony’s son‑in‑law. Auld is a mean man made harsher by his false religious piety. Auld considers Douglass unmanageable, so Auld rents him for one year to Edward Covey, a man known for “breaking” enslaved people. Covey manages, in the first six months, to work and whip all the spirit out of Douglass. Douglass becomes a brutish man, no longer interested in reading or freedom, capable only of resting from his injuries and exhaustion. The turning point comes when Douglass resolves to fight back against Covey. The two men have a two‑hour fight, after which Covey never touches Douglass again.
His year with Covey over, Douglass is next rented to William Freeland for two years. Though Freeland is a milder, fairer man, Douglass’s will to escape is nonetheless renewed. At Freeland’s, Douglass begins educating his fellow enslaved people in a Sabbath school at the homes of free Black people. Despite the threat of punishment and violence they face, many enslaved people from neighboring farms come to Douglass and work diligently to learn. At Freeland’s, Douglass also forms a plan of escape with three fellow enslaved men with whom he is close. Someone betrays their plan to Freeland, however, and Douglass and the others are taken to jail. Thomas Auld then sends Douglass back to Baltimore with Hugh Auld, to learn the trade of ship caulking.
In Baltimore’s trade industry, Douglass runs up against strained race relations. White workers have been working alongside free Black workers, but the whites have begun to fear that the increasing numbers of free Black people will take their jobs. Though only an apprentice and still enslaved, Douglass encounters violent tactics of intimidation from his white coworkers and is forced to switch shipyards. In his new apprenticeship, Douglass quickly learns the trade of caulking and soon earns the highest wages possible, always turning them over to Hugh Auld.
Eventually, Douglass receives permission from Hugh Auld to hire out his extra time. He saves money bit by bit and eventually makes his escape to New York. Douglass refrains from describing the details of his escape in order to protect the safety of future slaves who may attempt the journey. In New York, Douglass fears recapture and changes his name from Bailey to Douglass. Soon after, he marries Anna Murray, a free woman he met while in Baltimore. They move north to Massachusetts, where Douglass becomes deeply engaged with the abolitionist movement as both a writer and an orator."
Kindred,"On June 9, 1976, it is the twenty-sixth birthday of Dana, a young Black woman. She and Kevin Franklin, her white husband, move into their new apartment in Southern California. Dana does the majority of the unpacking and settling in; Kevin focuses on his office and then stops helping. Dana gets dizzy, and her surroundings fade away. When she comes to, she finds herself in the early 1800s in Maryland. A young white boy named Rufus is struggling in a river. Dana wades in after him, but he is unconscious by the time she reaches him. She drags him to the shore and resuscitates him. Tom Weylin, Rufus’s father, arrives and points a gun at Dana, terrifying her. Following another dizzy spell, she reappears in her apartment in 1976.
Several minutes later, Dana again gets dizzy and disappears. This time, she is whisked back to 1815. Rufus, now a few years older, watches in horror as his bedroom drapes burn. He had set fire to them because he was angry with his father for selling a horse he wanted. Dana puts out the fire, talks to Rufus, and escapes from the house before Weylin finds out she is there. She runs to the home of Alice Greenwood and her mother, free Balck people who Dana suspects may be her ancestors. A group of young white men smash down the Greenwoods’ door, drag out Alice’s husband, who is a slave, and beat him. They also beat Alice’s mother. After the men leave, Dana comes out of hiding and helps Alice’s mother. Dana steps outside, and a returning white man finds her, beats her, and attempts to rape her. Dana fears for her life. Following another dizzy spell, she returns home to her own time.
The next time Dana time travels, Kevin comes with her by holding onto her. Back at the Weylins’, Rufus has fallen out of a tree and broken his leg. Nigel, a young Black boy, runs for help, and Weylin comes with his slave, Luke. Rufus will not let Dana leave, so everyone returns to the house together. Kevin and Dana stay on the plantation for several weeks and help educate Rufus. But when Dana gets caught teaching Nigel to read, Weylin whips her. Dana returns to 1976, but Kevin does not arrive in time to go with her.
After eight days at home, Dana time travels back and finds that Kevin has left the Maryland area and that Rufus has raped Alice Greenwood. Alice’s husband, Isaac, a slave, is beating Rufus badly. Dana convinces Isaac not to kill Rufus, and Alice and Isaac run away while Dana gets Rufus home. She stays in Maryland for two months. Although Rufus lies about how he got injured, Alice and Isaac are caught, and Alice is beaten and ravaged by dogs. As punishment for helping Isaac escape, Alice is made a slave. Rufus, who is in love with Alice, buys her. He forces Dana to convince Alice to sleep with him after her body has recovered. After Rufus fails to mail her letters to Kevin, Dana attempts to run away. As a result, she receives a vicious whipping, which so hurts and frightens her that she loses the will to run away again. Kevin shows up, as Weylin had written to him, and the couple attempts to escape. Rufus catches them on the road and shoots at them, but they manage to time travel together back to the 1970s.
After a few days, Dana time travels by herself back to Maryland and finds Rufus very drunk and lying facedown in a puddle. Weylin refuses to get a doctor. Over the course of many days, Dana nurses Rufus back to health. Rufus remains weak for weeks. Weylin has a heart attack, and Dana is unable to save him. Rufus blames her for his father’s death and forces her to work in the fields until she collapses.
Rufus is much harsher with Alice than he is with Dana. Alice is jealous of the kindness with which Rufus treats Dana. Alice gives birth to her second child with Rufus, Hagar, who is Dana’s direct ancestor. She tells Dana that she plans to run away as soon as she can. She fears that she is getting too used to Rufus, that she doesn’t hate him enough anymore. Weylin’s wife, Margaret, returns. Dana is forced to care for her. Rufus sells off some slaves, including Tess, his father’s former consort. He also sells Sam, a field hand, as punishment for flirting with Dana. When Dana tries to interfere, Rufus hits her. She slits her wrists in an effort to time travel and is successful.
Dana is back at home for many days. She and Kevin quarrel a little about Rufus. Kevin is jealous of his relationship with Dana, which Dana finds ridiculous. When Dana returns to the plantation, she finds that Alice has attempted to run away. To retaliate, Rufus told her that he sold her children, although actually he only sent them off to live with his aunt in Baltimore. Alice is sick with grief and eventually kills herself. Racked with guilt and anger about Alice’s death, Rufus nearly kills himself. He keeps Dana at his side almost constantly. One day, he tells her that she is so like Alice he cannot stand it. He catches her by the wrists, and Dana struggles free. She goes to the attic, planning to slit her wrists in order to get home, but Rufus follows her and attempts to rape her. Dana stabs him twice with her knife, killing him. She returns home immediately. Her arm is severed and crushed in the spot where Rufus was holding it."
Grows,"Billy lives on a farm. He wants two good coonhounds very badly, but his Papa cannot afford any. Billy works hard, selling fruit and bait to fishermen, so eventually he has enough money for the dogs. He gives the money to his grandfather, who orders the dogs for him. Billy sneaks off in the middle of the night to go to town and pick them up. While in town, other children pick on him, but he stands up for himself and is helped by the marshal. On his way home, he and his two pups sleep in a cave. Outside, they hear a mountain lion, and the pups bravely howl back. He decides to name them Old Dan and Little Ann. He can see that Old Dan is very brave, and that Little Ann is very smart.
Once home, he wants to begin training them. He has to have a raccoon hide to train them with. His grandfather shows him a way to set a trap that will catch even a clever coon. Just when he is about to give up on the traps, he catches a coon. The next day he begins to train Old Dan and Little Ann. By the time raccoon season starts in the fall, they are ready. On the first night, his dogs tree a coon in the biggest tree imaginable. Billy immediately sees that it will take days to cut down. He is determined to cut it down, because he told his dogs that if they could tree a coon he would take care of the rest. His dogs are counting on him. His parents bring him food. His grandfather shows him how to make a scarecrow, to keep the coon in the tree so he can go home and eat dinner. When the big sycamore finally falls and his dogs catch the coon, he is very proud.
Billy goes coon hunting almost every night. His father relieves him of his chores, and Billy gives him the money from his coonskins. Sometimes, coons try to trick his dogs, and Old Dan gets into trouble. One night, Dan gets stuck in a muskrat hole. Another night, he climbs a tree. Little Ann is usually too smart to get into trouble, but one night, after the first snowfall, she falls through the ice on the river. Billy barely rescues her.
One day, Billy and his grandfather make a bet with Ruben and Rainie Pritchard, that Billy's hounds can catch the legendary ""ghost coon."" The Pritchard boys set out with Billy to see if Old Dan and Little Ann can catch the ghost coon. The coon leads the dogs on a long, complicated chase, and the Pritchard boys want to give up. But Billy is determined. Finally, when the dogs have the coon treed, Billy refuses to kill her. Just as Ruben starts to beat up Billy, Old Dan and Little Ann begin to attack the Pritchards' dog. Ruben runs to attack the dogs with an axe, but falls and kills himself. Billy is very distraught afterward. Finally he goes to Ruben's grave with some flowers, then feels much better.
Billy's grandfather enters Billy in a coon-hunting contest. He, his grandfather, and his father take a buggy to the contest. It is filled with adult coon hunters with expensive gear and beautiful hounds. Somehow, Little Ann wins the beauty contest on the first day. The other coon hunters are very kind to Billy. Billy and his dogs qualify for the championship round. While Billy, his papa, his grandfather, and a judge are out hunting with coons, a winter blizzard begins. They lose track of the dogs, and Billy's grandfather falls and badly sprains his ankle. They stop and build a fire as day begins to break. Soon enough, they find the dogs, covered with ice. They have gotten just enough coons to win. Everyone at the tournament cheers. Billy has also won a jackpot of 300 dollars.
Billy's mama and sisters are overjoyed. Billy keeps up his hunting. One night, however, his dogs tree a mountain lion. Old Dan howls defiantly, and the big cat attacks. Billy is horrified, and with his axe he enters the fray, hoping to save his dogs, but they end up having to save him. Eventually, the dogs defeat the mountain lion, but Old Dan is badly wounded. He dies the next day. Billy is heartbroken, but Little Ann is so sad that she loses her will to live, and dies a few days later. Billy's papa tries to tell him that it is all for the best, because with the money Billy has earned, the family hopes to move to town. Billy does not completely recover until on the day of the move; he goes to visit the dogs' graves and finds a giant red fern. According to Indian legend, only an angel can plant a red fern. Billy and his family look at the fern in awe, and he feels ready to leave for the town."

Escapes,"The convict Jean Valjean is released from a French prison after serving nineteen years for stealing a loaf of bread and for subsequent attempts to escape from prison. When Valjean arrives at the town of Digne, no one is willing to give him shelter because he is an ex-convict. Desperate, Valjean knocks on the door of M. Myriel, the kindly bishop of Digne.

On the way to Montreuil, however, Fantine realizes that she will never be able to find work if the townspeople know that she has an illegitimate child. In the town of Montfermeil, she meets the Thénardiers, a family that runs the local inn. The Thénardiers agree to look after Cosette as long as Fantine sends them a monthly allowance.
In Montreuil, Fantine finds work in Madeleine’s factory. Fantine’s coworkers find out about Cosette, however, and Fantine is fired. The Thénardiers demand more money to support Cosette, and Fantine resorts to prostitution to make ends meet. One night, Javert, Montreuil’s police chief, arrests Fantine. She is to be sent to prison, but Madeleine intervenes. Fantine has fallen ill, and when she longs to see Cosette, Madeleine promises to send for her. First, however, he must contend with Javert, who has discovered Madeleine’s criminal past. Javert tells Madeleine that a man has been accused of being Jean Valjean, and Madeleine confesses his true identity. Javert shows up to arrest Valjean while Valjean is at Fantine’s bedside, and Fantine dies from the shock.
After a few years, Valjean escapes from prison and heads to Montfermeil, where he is able to buy Cosette from the Thénardiers. The Thénardiers turn out to be a family of scoundrels who abuse Cosette while spoiling their own two daughters, Eponine and Azelma. Valjean and Cosette move to a run-down part of Paris. Javert discovers their hideout, however, and they are forced to flee. They find refuge in a convent, where Cosette attends school and Valjean works as a gardener.
Marius Pontmercy is a young man who lives with his wealthy grandfather, M. Gillenormand. Because of political differences within the family, Marius has never met his father, Georges Pontmercy. After his father dies, however, Marius learns more about him and comes to admire his father’s democratic politics. Angry with his grandfather, Marius moves out of Gillenormand’s house and lives as a poor young law student. While in law school, Marius associates with a group of radical students, the Friends of the ABC, who are led by the charismatic Enjolras. One day, Marius sees Cosette at a public park. It is love at first sight, but the protective Valjean does his utmost to prevent Cosette and Marius from ever meeting. Their paths cross once again, however, when Valjean makes a charitable visit to Marius’s poor neighbors, the Jondrettes. The Jondrettes are in fact the Thénardiers, who have lost their inn and moved to Paris under an assumed name. After Valjean leaves, Thénardier announces a plan to rob Valjean when he returns. Alarmed, Marius alerts the local police inspector, who turns out to be Javert. The ambush is foiled and the Thénardiers are arrested, but Valjean escapes before Javert can identify him.
Thénardier’s daughter Eponine, who is in love with Marius, helps Marius discover Cosette’s whereabouts. Marius is finally able to make contact with Cosette, and the two declare their love for each other. Valjean, however, soon shatters their happiness. Worried that he will lose Cosette and unnerved by political unrest in the city, Valjean announces that he and Cosette are moving to England. In desperation, Marius runs to his grandfather, M. Gillenormand, to ask for M. Gillenormand’s permission to marry Cosette. Their meeting ends in a bitter argument. When Marius returns to Cosette, she and Valjean have disappeared. Heartbroken, Marius decides to join his radical student friends, who have started a political uprising. Armed with two pistols, Marius heads for the barricades.
The uprising seems doomed, but Marius and his fellow students nonetheless stand their ground and vow to fight for freedom and democracy. The students discover Javert among their ranks, and, realizing that he is a spy, Enjolras ties him up. As the army launches its first attack against the students, Eponine throws herself in front of a rifle to save Marius’s life. As Eponine dies in Marius’s arms, she hands him a letter from Cosette. Marius quickly scribbles a reply and orders a boy, Gavroche, to deliver it to Cosette.
Valjean manages to intercept the note and sets out to save the life of the man his daughter loves. Valjean arrives at the barricade and volunteers to execute Javert. When alone with Javert, however, Valjean instead secretly lets him go free. As the army storms the barricade, Valjean grabs the wounded Marius and flees through the sewers. When Valjean emerges hours later, Javert immediately arrests him. Valjean pleads with Javert to let him take the dying Marius to Marius’s grandfather. Javert agrees. Javert feels tormented, torn between his duty to his profession and the debt he owes Valjean for saving his life. Ultimately, Javert lets Valjean go and throws himself into the river, where he drowns.
Marius makes a full recovery and is reconciled with Gillenormand, who consents to Marius and Cosette’s marriage. Their wedding is a happy one, marred only when Valjean confesses his criminal past to Marius. Alarmed by this revelation and unaware that it was Valjean who saved his life at the barricades, Marius tries to prevent Cosette from having contact with Valjean. Lonely and depressed, Valjean takes to his bed and awaits his death. Marius eventually finds out from Thénardier that Valjean saved Marius’s life. Ashamed that he mistrusted Valjean, Marius tells Cosette everything that has happened. Marius and Cosette rush to Valjean’s side just in time for a final reconciliation. Happy to be reunited with his adopted daughter, Valjean dies in peace."
Long,"The Giver is written from the point of view of Jonas, an eleven-year-old boy living in a futuristic society that has eliminated all pain, fear, war, and hatred. There is no prejudice, since everyone looks and acts basically the same, and there is very little competition. Everyone is unfailingly polite. The society has also eliminated choice: at age twelve every member of the community is assigned a job based on his or her abilities and interests. Citizens can apply for and be assigned compatible spouses, and each couple is assigned exactly two children each. The children are born to Birthmothers, who never see them, and spend their first year in a Nurturing Center with other babies, or “newchildren,” born that year. When their children are grown, family units dissolve and adults live together with Childless Adults until they are too old to function in the society. Then they spend their last years being cared for in the House of the Old until they are finally “released” from the society. In the community, release is death, but it is never described that way; most people think that after release, flawed newchildren and joyful elderly people are welcomed into the vast expanse of Elsewhere that surrounds the communities. Citizens who break rules or fail to adapt properly to the society’s codes of behavior are also released, though in their cases it is an occasion of great shame. Everything is planned and organized so that life is as convenient and pleasant as possible.
Jonas lives with his father, a Nurturer of new children, his mother, who works at the Department of Justice, and his seven-year-old sister Lily. At the beginning of the novel, he is apprehensive about the upcoming Ceremony of Twelve, when he will be given his official Assignment as a new adult member of the community. He does not have a distinct career preference, although he enjoys volunteering at a variety of different jobs. Though he is a well-behaved citizen and a good student, Jonas is different: he has pale eyes, while most people in his community have dark eyes, and he has unusual powers of perception. Sometimes objects “change” when he looks at them. He does not know it yet, but he alone in his community can perceive flashes of color; for everyone else, the world is as devoid of color as it is of pain, hunger, and inconvenience.
At the Ceremony of Twelve, Jonas is given the highly honored Assignment of Receiver of Memory. The Receiver is the sole keeper of the community’s collective memory. When the community went over to Sameness—its painless, warless, and mostly emotionless state of tranquility and harmony—it abandoned all memories of pain, war, and emotion, but the memories cannot disappear totally. Someone must keep them so that the community can avoid making the mistakes of the past, even though no one but the Receiver can bear the pain. Jonas receives the memories of the past, good and bad, from the current Receiver, a wise old man who tells Jonas to call him the Giver.
The Giver transmits memories by placing his hands on Jonas’s bare back. The first memory he receives is of an exhilarating sled ride. As Jonas receives memories from the Giver—memories of pleasure and pain, of bright colors and extreme cold and warm sun, of excitement and terror and hunger and love—he realizes how bland and empty life in his community really is. The memories make Jonas’s life richer and more meaningful, and he wishes that he could give that richness and meaning to the people he loves. But in exchange for their peaceful existence, the people of Jonas’s community have lost the capacity to love him back or to feel deep passion about anything. Since they have never experienced real suffering, they also cannot appreciate the real joy of life, and the life of individual people seems less precious to them. In addition, no one in Jonas’s community has ever made a choice of his or her own. Jonas grows more and more frustrated with the members of his community, and the Giver, who has felt the same way for many years, encourages him. The two grow very close, like a grandfather and a grandchild might have in the days before Sameness, when family members stayed in contact long after their children were grown.
Meanwhile, Jonas is helping his family take care of a problem newchild, Gabriel, who has trouble sleeping through the night at the Nurturing Center. Jonas helps the child to sleep by transmitting soothing memories to him every night, and he begins to develop a relationship with Gabriel that mirrors the family relationships he has experienced through the memories. When Gabriel is in danger of being released, the Giver reveals to Jonas that release is the same as death. Jonas’s rage and horror at this revelation inspire the Giver to help Jonas devise a plan to change things in the community forever. The Giver tells Jonas about the girl who had been designated the new Receiver ten years before. She had been the Giver’s own daughter, but the sadness of some of the memories had been too much for her and she had asked to be released. When she died, all of the memories she had accumulated were released into the community, and the community members could not handle the sudden influx of emotion and sensation. The Giver and Jonas plan for Jonas to escape the community and to actually enter Elsewhere. Once he has done that, his larger supply of memories will disperse, and the Giver will help the community to come to terms with the new feelings and thoughts, changing the society forever.
However, Jonas is forced to leave earlier than planned when his father tells him that Gabriel will be released the next day. Desperate to save Gabriel, Jonas steals his father’s bicycle and a supply of food and sets off for Elsewhere. Gradually, he enters a landscape full of color, animals, and changing weather, but also hunger, danger, and exhaustion. Avoiding search planes, Jonas and Gabriel travel for a long time until heavy snow makes bike travel impossible. Half-frozen, but comforting Gabriel with memories of sunshine and friendship, Jonas mounts a high hill. There he finds a sled—the sled from his first transmitted memory—waiting for him at the top. Jonas and Gabriel experience a glorious downhill ride on the sled. Ahead of them, they see—or think they see—the twinkling lights of a friendly village at Christmas, and they hear music. Jonas is sure that someone is waiting for them there."
Complete,"Scout Finch lives with her brother, Jem, and their widowed father, Atticus, in the sleepy Alabama town of Maycomb. Maycomb is suffering through the Great Depression, but Atticus is a prominent lawyer and the Finch family is reasonably well off in comparison to the rest of society. One summer, Jem and Scout befriend a boy named Dill, who has come to live in their neighborhood for the summer, and the trio acts out stories together. Eventually, Dill becomes fascinated with the spooky house on their street called the Radley Place. The house is owned by Mr. Nathan Radley, whose brother, Arthur (nicknamed Boo), has lived there for years without venturing outside.
Scout goes to school for the first time that fall and detests it. She and Jem find gifts apparently left for them in a knothole of a tree on the Radley property. Dill returns the following summer, and he, Scout, and Jem begin to act out the story of Boo Radley. Atticus puts a stop to their antics, urging the children to try to see life from another person’s perspective before making judgments. But, on Dill’s last night in Maycomb for the summer, the three sneak onto the Radley property, where Nathan Radley shoots at them. Jem loses his pants in the ensuing escape. When he returns for them, he finds them mended and hung over the fence.
The next winter, Jem and Scout find more presents in the tree, presumably left by the mysterious Boo. Nathan Radley eventually plugs the knothole with cement. Shortly thereafter, a fire breaks out in another neighbor’s house, and during the fire someone slips a blanket on Scout’s shoulders as she watches the blaze. Convinced that Boo did it, Jem tells Atticus about the mended pants and the presents.
To the consternation of Maycomb’s racist white community, Atticus agrees to defend a Black man named Tom Robinson, who has been accused of raping a white woman. Because of Atticus’s decision, Jem and Scout are subjected to abuse from other children, even when they celebrate Christmas at the family compound on Finch’s Landing. Calpurnia, the Finches’ Black cook, takes them to the local Black church, where the warm and close-knit community largely embraces the children.
Atticus’s sister, Alexandra, comes to live with the Finches the next summer. Dill, who is supposed to live with his “new father” in another town, runs away and comes to Maycomb. Tom Robinson’s trial begins, and when the accused man is placed in the local jail, a mob gathers to lynch him. Atticus faces the mob down the night before the trial. Jem and Scout, who have sneaked out of the house, soon join him. Scout recognizes one of the men, and her polite questioning about his son shames him into dispersing the mob.
At the trial itself, the children sit in the “colored balcony” with the town’s Black citizens. Atticus provides clear evidence that the accusers, Mayella Ewell and her father, Bob, are lying: in fact, Mayella propositioned Tom Robinson, was caught by her father, and then accused Tom of rape to cover her shame and guilt. Atticus provides impressive evidence that the marks on Mayella’s face are from wounds that her father inflicted; upon discovering her with Tom, he called her a whore and beat her. Yet, despite the significant evidence pointing to Tom’s innocence, the all-white jury convicts him. The innocent Tom later tries to escape from prison and is shot to death. In the aftermath of the trial, Jem’s faith in justice is badly shaken, and he lapses into despondency and doubt.
Despite the verdict, Bob Ewell feels that Atticus and the judge have made a fool out of him, and he vows revenge. He menaces Tom Robinson’s widow, tries to break into the judge’s house, and finally attacks Jem and Scout as they walk home from a Halloween party. Boo Radley intervenes, however, saving the children and stabbing Ewell fatally during the struggle. Boo carries the wounded Jem back to Atticus’s house, where the sheriff, in order to protect Boo, insists that Ewell tripped over a tree root and fell on his own knife. After sitting with Scout for a while, Boo disappears once more into the Radley house.  
Later, Scout feels as though she can finally imagine what life is like for Boo. He has become a human being to her at last. With this realization, Scout embraces her father’s advice to practice sympathy and understanding and demonstrates that her experiences with hatred and prejudice will not sully her faith in human goodness."
Looked,"Julian West, the narrator of Looking Backward, was born into an aristocratic family in the late nineteenth century. The gap between the rich and poor was vast and seemingly impossible to remedy through any means. Like other members of his class, Julian thought himself superior to the toiling masses, and he regarded their frequent strikes with anger and contempt. Julian was engaged to Edith Bartlett, a beautiful, graceful Boston aristocrat. They planned to marry when the construction of their new home was completed, but the frequent strikes by the building trades had delayed their marriage for over a year.
Julian, a sufferer of insomnia, had secretly built an underground sleeping chamber to shield himself from street noises. He also enlisted the aid of Doctor Pillsbury, a skilled mesmerist, who never failed to leave Julian in a deep sleep. Pillsbury trained Julian's servant, Sawyer, to revive Julian from a mesmerized sleep. The night before Pillsbury left Boston for a new job in New Orleans, Julian enlisted his help one last time. After Pillsbury left, Julian's home was destroyed by a fire; Julian was protected by his underground chamber. Because no one knew of his chamber, Julian was assumed dead.
Over one hundred years later, Julian's secret chamber is discovered by Doctor Leete, who was preparing the site for the construction of a new laboratory. Julian has not aged a day because he has been in a state of suspended animation. Doctor Leete revives him and takes him into his home. Julian quickly learns that twentieth-century society is vastly different from that of the nineteenth century. The economy is based on publicly owned capital rather than private, as was the case in Julian's day. The government controls the means of production and divides the national product equally between all citizens. Every citizen receives a college-level education. Individuals are given a great deal of freedom in choosing a career, and everyone retires at the age of forty-five. Society is based on an ideal of the brotherhood of man, and it is unthinkable that any individual should suffer the evils of poverty or hunger. With Doctor Leete's guidance, Julian comes to understand and appreciate the twentieth-century society. Meanwhile, Julian learns that Doctor Leete's daughter, Edith is the great-granddaughter of Edith Bartlett. Julian and Edith become engaged, much to Doctor Leete's pleasure.
Julian has a terrible nightmare, in which he dreams that his transportation to the twentieth century was nothing but a dream. He finds himself trapped again in the cruel and inhumane world of the nineteenth century. To his great distress, he now sees all of the horrendous faults of nineteenth-century society. He tries to explain to his friends--Edith Bartlett and her family-- why their society is so awful and cruel, and how it can be transformed into something much better. However, they are only frightened and angered, so they expel Julian from their company. When Julian wakes from this nightmare to discover that his trip to the twentieth century was not just a dream, he is greatly relieved."
Drastically,"Euripedes' Medea opens in a state of conflict. Jason has abandoned his wife, Medea, along with their two children. He hopes to advance his station by remarrying with Glauce, the daughter of Creon, king of Corinth, the Greek city where the play is set. All the events of play proceed out of this initial dilemma, and the involved parties become its central characters.
Outside the royal palace, a nurse laments the events that have lead to the present crisis. After a long series of trials and adventures, which ultimately forced Jason and Medea to seek exile in Corinth, the pair had settled down and established their family, achieving a degree of fame and respectability. Jason's recent abandonment of that family has crushed Medea emotionally, to the degree that she curses her own existence, as well as that of her two children.
Fearing a possible plot of revenge, Creon banishes Medea and her children from the city. After pleading for mercy, Medea is granted one day before she must leave, during which she plans to complete her quest for ""justice""--at this stage in her thinking, the murder of Creon, Glauce, and Jason. Jason accuses Medea of overreacting. By voicing her grievances so publicly, she has endangered her life and that of their children. He claims that his decision to remarry was in everyone's best interest. Medea finds him spineless, and she refuses to accept his token offers of help.
Appearing by chance in Corinth, Aegeus, King of Athens, offers Medea sanctuary in his home city in exchange for her knowledge of certain drugs that can cure his sterility. Now guaranteed an eventual haven in Athens, Medea has cleared all obstacles to completing her revenge, a plan which grows to include the murder of her own children; the pain their loss will cause her does not outweigh the satisfaction she will feel in making Jason suffer.
For the balance of the play, Medea engages in a ruse; she pretends to sympathize with Jason (bringing him into her confidence) and offers his wife ""gifts,"" a coronet and dress. Ostensibly, the gifts are meant to convince Glauce to ask her father to allow the children to stay in Corinth. The coronet and dress are actually poisoned, however, and their delivery causes Glauce's death. Seeing his daughter ravaged by the poison, Creon chooses to die by her side by dramatically embracing her and absorbing the poison himself.
A messenger recounts the gruesome details of these deaths, which Medea absorbs with cool attentiveness. Her earlier state of anxiety, which intensified as she struggled with the decision to commit infanticide, has now given way to an assured determination to fulfill her plans. Against the protests of the chorus, Medea murders her children and flees the scene in a dragon-pulled chariot provided by her grandfather, the Sun-God. Jason is left cursing his lot; his hope of advancing his station by abandoning Medea and marrying Glauce, the conflict which opened the play, has been annihilated, and everything he values has been lost through the deaths that conclude the tragedy."
Whose,"The play Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? is set on the campus of a small, New England university. It opens with the main characters, George and Martha coming home from a party at her father's house. The two of them clearly care deeply for each other, but events have turned their marriage into a nasty battle between two disenchanted, cynical enemies. Even though the pair arrives home at two o'clock in the morning, they are expecting guests: the new math professor and his wife.
Of course, as it turns out, this new, young professor, Nick, actually works in the biology department. He and his wife, Honey, walk into a brutal social situation. In the first act, ""Fun and Games,"" Martha and George try to fight and humiliate each other in new, inventive ways. As they peel away each other's pretenses and self-respect, George and Martha use Honey and Nick as pawns, transforming their guests into an audience to witness humiliation, into levers for creating jealousy, and into a means for expressing their own sides of their mutual story. In the second act, ""Walpurgisnacht,"" these games get even nastier. The evening turns into a nightmare. George and Martha even attack Honey and Nick, attempting to force them to reveal their dirty secrets and true selves. Finally, in the last act, ""The Exorcism,"" everyone's secrets have been revealed and purged. Honey and Nick go home, leaving Martha and George to try to rebuild their shattered marriage."
No,"Three damned souls, Garcin, Inez, and Estelle are brought to the same room in hell by a mysterious Valet. They had all expected medieval torture devices to punish them for eternity, but instead find a plain room furnished in Second Empire style. None of them will admit the reason for their damnation: Garcin says that he was executed for being a pacifist, while Estelle insists that a mistake has been made.
Inez however, demands that they all stop lying to themselves and confess to their crimes. She refuses to believe that they all ended up in the room by accident and soon realizes that they have been placed together to make each other miserable. Garcin suggests that they try to leave each other alone, but Inez starts to sing about an execution and Estelle wants to find a mirror. Inez tries to seduce Estelle by offering to be her ""mirror"" and tell her everything she sees, but ends up frightening her instead.
After arguing they decide to confess to their crimes so they know what to expect from each other. Garcin cheated and mistreated his wife; Inez seduced her cousin's wife while living with them; and Estelle cheated on her husband and drowned her illegitimate baby. Despite their revelations they continue to get on each other's nerves. Garcin finally gives in to Estelle's attempts to seduce him, driving Inez crazy. He begs Estelle to tell him he is not a coward for attempting to flee his country during wartime. When Inez tells him that Estelle is just agreeing with him so she can be with a man, Garcin tries to escape. The door suddenly opens, but he is unable to leave. He says that he will not be saved until Inez has faith in him. She refuses, promising to make him miserable forever. Forgetting that they are all dead, Estelle unsuccessfully tries to kill Inez, stabbing her repeatedly. Shocked at the absurdity of his fate, Garcin concludes, ""hell is other people."""
Aliens,"It is the late twentieth century. Both the United States and the Soviet Union are about to enter outer space using nuclear-powered spaceships. Just as both countries close in on the achievement of space travel, a number of giant alien spaceships come down over every major city in the world.
Five years later, these aliens, known as the Overlords, have taken control of the entire world. Their flagship is based over New York and is managed by Karellen, the Overlord who is charge of Earth-related affairs. The humans know Karellen as ""the Supervisor."" Karellen uses the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Stormgren, as his liaison to the human race. Once every few weeks, Karellen meets with Stormgren inside his ship. However, neither Stormgren nor any other human has ever seen what an Overlord looks like.
Stormgren is attempting to placate the Freedom League, a group that opposes the Overlords' dominion, no matter how friendly the aliens seem to be. A radical fringe group of the Freedom League kidnaps Stormgren; Karellen uses Stormgren as bait so he can keep track of these radicals. The radicals do give Stormgren the idea to use a scanning device to try and find out what is inside the room where he and Karellen meet. Stormgren then meets with Karellen, who announces that the Overlords will reveal themselves in fifty years. Stormgren then uses the scanner and discovers that Karellen is on the other side of the blank ""viewscreen""--it's just a piece of one-way glass. Later, as he is handing over the paperwork for the World Federation, a new world government, Stormgren uses a flashlight to sneak a glimpse of Karellen.
Fifty years later, the Earth has greatly changed. It has become a utopia, where everyone has a place to live and enough food to eat. The Overlords have altered the world and raised the standard of living for everyone. At this time, the Overlords reveal themselves: they look almost exactly like the Devil, with dark black skin, giant wings, horns on their heads, and a barbed tail.
A few years later, George Greggson and Jean Morrel attend a party held by Rupert Boyce, an amateur scholar of the paranormal. While there, George and Jean run into Rashaverak, an Overlord making use of Boyce's research library. George also meets Jan Rodricks, a restless astronomer who is annoyed that the Overlords will not let mankind explore space. During the party, Boyce organizes a séance using a mechanized Ouija board. The board gives surprisingly accurate answers, and when Jan asks where the Overlords' homeworld is, it gives an exact star number. Jean faints after this incident. This fainting fit worries George, and he proposes marriage to Jean. Meanwhile, Jan takes the information he has learned and confirms it: the Overlord supply ships take off in the direction of the star given by the Ouija board. Rashaverak reports to Karellen and informs him that Jean should be watched, as she may be ""the most important human alive.""
After speaking again with Boyce, Jan gets an idea of how to sneak aboard an Overlord vessel. He meets with Sullivan and makes a plan to stow away inside a giant sperm whale that Sullivan is stuffing for the Overlords. The plan succeeds, and soon Jan is on his way to the Overlord homeworld. While the trip will seem like only a few months to him, due to time dilation at the speed of light eighty years will pass on Earth.
Back on Earth, George and Jean begin their life together. Eventually, George comes to believe he is stuck in a rut, and the couple decide to go to New Athens, an experimental community based on an island. The members of the community are primarily artists, and the hope is that they will reinvigorate the stagnating imagination of humanity. George and Jean take their two kids, Jeffrey and Jennifer, with them. The family adjusts to life on New Athens fairly well, but one day, a tsunami hits the island while Jeffrey is down at the beach. Jeffrey mysteriously survives and says that he heard a voice in his head that told him where to run.
A few weeks later, an Overlord visits New Athens. He tells the community he is just performing a routine inspection, but actually he is checking on Jeffrey. A few weeks after his visit, Jeffrey begins to have strange dreams, where he is walking across alien landscapes. His parents don't know what to make of the dreams, but the Overlords recognize the planets he describes as real worlds. George meets with Rashaverak, who tells him that his children aren't human-- they're something beyond humanity.
Jennifer, even though she is a baby, soon begins to exhibit powers herself--and her powers are even greater than those of Jeffrey. Soon all the children of the world are showing signs of strange mental powers. Karellen addresses all of mankind one last time, telling them that their children are taking a new evolutionary step. This is why the Overlords were sent to Earth--sent by the Overmind, a powerful being of thought and energy that absorbs and assimilates races once they have matured enough. Ironically, this is a step that the Overlords have never been able to make and may never be able to. The rest of humanity, however, is doomed. While the Overlords round up the children, many people decide to kill themselves. Jean and George die as New Athens blows itself up in a nuclear explosion.
Back on the Overlords spaceship, Jan arrives on the Overlords' homeworld. He is subjected to many tests by the curious Overlords and asked many questions. He is allowed to explore their cities a little bit, and he sees a strange mountain that may be an avatar of the Overmind. Finally, however, he is shipped back home. Nothing prepares him for what he sees: the Earth is deserted, except for three hundred million strange children. They have slowly been growing in power and ability, and their individual personalities have all but vanished. Soon, the Overmind will arrive, and the Earth will be destroyed as the children join the Overmind. While the Overlords prepare to leave, Jan decides to stay on Earth. As he watches, the Overmind arrives and absorbs the children. In the process, the children consume the Earth's crust, causing it to explode. The children consume all of the Earth for energy as they complete their transformation into the Overmind. From his ship, thousands of kilometers away, Karellen watches the end of humanity. He then awaits his next call from the Overmind and continues to explore its secrets."
Red,"M. de Rênal, the mayor of the provincial town Verrières, hires Julien Sorel to be his children's tutor. Julien is only a carpenter's son, but dreams of following in the footsteps of his hero, Napoleon. However, in Julien's time, men gain power in the Church and not in the army. Even though he is training to become a priest, Julien decides to seduce the mayor's wife, Mme. de Rênal, because he thinks that it is his duty. They become lovers, but M. Valenod, the mayor's political adversary, finds out about the affair and begins to spread rumors. M. de Rênal is profoundly embarrassed, but his wife convinces him that the rumors are false. M. Chélan, the town priest and Julien's mentor, sends him to the Besançon seminary to avoid any further scandal.
The director of the seminary, M. Pirard, likes Julien and encourages him to become a great priest. Julien does very well at the seminary, but only because he wants to make a fortune and succeed in French society. The other priests at the seminary are not aware of Julien's hypocrisy, but are jealous of his intelligence. M. Pirard is disgusted with the political involvement of the Church and resigns. His aristocratic benefactor, the Marquis de la Mole, wants M. Pirard to be his personal secretary in Paris, but M. Pirard tells him to hire Julien instead.
Julien is both enthralled and repulsed by Parisian society at the same time. He tries to fit in among the nobles but they treat him as a social inferior. However, the Marquis's daughter, Mathilde, falls in love with Julien and they become lovers. When Mathilde gets pregnant and tells the Marquis about her affair, he is furious, but soon ennobles Julien so Mathilde can marry him. Julien finally has the aristocratic title he always wanted. But Mme. de Rênal sends the Marquis a letter denouncing Julien as a womanizer only concerned with making his fortune. The Marquis then refuses to let Mathilde marry Julien, who furiously returns to Verrières and shoots Mme. de Rênal. She survives, but Julien is sentenced to death anyway. Mme. de Rênal forgives Julien and dies of love three days after his execution."
Like,"John Howard Griffin, the author and main character of Black Like Me, is a middle-aged white man living in Mansfield, Texas, in 1959. Deeply committed to the cause of racial justice and frustrated by his inability as a white man to understand the Black experience, Griffin decides to take a radical step. He decides to undergo medical treatment to change the color of his skin and temporarily become a Black man. After securing the support of his wife and of George Levitan, the editor of a Black-oriented magazine called Sepia which will fund Griffin's experience in return for an article about it, Griffin sets out for New Orleans to begin his life posing as a Black man. He finds a contact in the Black community, a soft-spoken, wise shoe-shiner named Sterling Williams, and begins a dermatological regimen of exposure to ultraviolet light, oral medication, and skin dyes. Eventually, Griffin looks in the mirror and sees a Black man looking back. He briefly panics, feeling that he has lost his identity, and then he sets out to explore the Black community.
Griffin expects to find prejudice, oppression, and hardship, but he is shocked at the extent of it. Everywhere he goes, he experiences difficulties and insults. The word “n*****” seems to echo from every street corner. It is impossible to find a job, or even a restroom that Blacks are allowed to use. Clerks refuse to cash his checks, and a white bully nearly attacks him before he chases the man away. After several traumatic days in New Orleans, Griffin decides to travel into the Deep South of Mississippi and Alabama, which are reputed to be even worse for Black people. (In Mississippi, a grand jury has just refused to indict a lynch mob that murdered a Black man before he could stand trial.) In Mississippi, he is disheartened and exhausted, so he calls a white friend named P.D. East, a newspaperman who is ferociously opposed to racism. He spends a day with East, during which time they discuss the way racial prejudice has been incorporated into the South's legal code by bigoted writers and politicians. Eventually, a rejuvenated Griffin leaves for a long hitchhiking trip throughout Alabama and Mississippi.
In general, Griffin finds that conditions for Black people are appalling, and that Black communities seem run-down and defeated. He even notices a look of defeat and hopelessness on his own face, after only a few weeks as a Black man. In Montgomery, however, the Black community is charged with determination and energy by the example of one of its leaders, a preacher named Marin Luther King, Jr. Black people in Montgomery have begun practicing passive resistance, a nonviolent form of refusing to comply with racist laws and rules.
Griffin, again depressed and weary of life as a Black man, briefly stops taking his medication and lightens his skin back to his normal color. He begins alternating back and forth between races, visiting a place first as a Black man and then as a white man. He notices immediately that when he is a white man, whites treat him with respect and Black people treat him with suspicious fear; when he is a Black man, Black people treat him with generosity and warmth, while whites treat him with hostility and contempt. Griffin concludes that the races do not understand one another at all, and that a tolerant dialogue is needed to bridge the terrible gap separating them.
In Atlanta, Griffin conducts a long series of interviews with Black leaders before returning to New Orleans to make a photographic record of his time there. He then goes off his medication entirely, permanently returning his skin color to white. He returns home to his family and writes his article, which is published in March 1960. After the article appears, Griffin is called on to do interviews with prominent television shows and newsmagazines. The story of his amazing experience quickly spreads around the world, and he receives a flood of congratulatory mail.
In Mansfield, however, the prevalent attitude is that of racism, and Griffin and his family become the subject of hateful reprisals. An effigy of Griffin, painted half white and half black, is burned on Main Street; a cross is burned in a Negro schoolyard; threats are made against Griffin, including one to castrate him. By August, things are so bad that he has decided to move his family to Mexico. Before he goes, he has a talk with a young Black boy, to whom he explains that racism is a result of social conditioning, not any inherent quality within Blacks or whites. He issues a plea for tolerance and understanding between the races, fearing that, if the current conflict is sustained, it will explode in an outbreak of terrible violence."
Earn,"Jack Worthing, the play’s protagonist, is a pillar of the community in Hertfordshire, where he is guardian to Cecily Cardew, the pretty, eighteen-year-old granddaughter of the late Thomas Cardew, who found and adopted Jack when he was a baby. In Hertfordshire, Jack has responsibilities: he is a major landowner and justice of the peace, with tenants, farmers, and a number of servants and other employees all dependent on him. For years, he has also pretended to have an irresponsible black-sheep brother named Ernest who leads a scandalous life in pursuit of pleasure and is always getting into trouble of a sort that requires Jack to rush grimly off to his assistance. In fact, Ernest is merely Jack’s alibi, a phantom that allows him to disappear for days at a time and do as he likes. No one but Jack knows that he himself is Ernest. Ernest is the name Jack goes by in London, which is where he really goes on these occasions—probably to pursue the very sort of behavior he pretends to disapprove of in his imaginary brother.
Jack is in love with Gwendolen Fairfax, the cousin of his best friend, Algernon Moncrieff. When the play opens, Algernon, who knows Jack as Ernest, has begun to suspect something, having found an inscription inside Jack’s cigarette case addressed to “Uncle Jack” from someone who refers to herself as “little Cecily.” Algernon suspects that Jack may be leading a double life, a practice he seems to regard as commonplace and indispensable to modern life. He calls a person who leads a double life a “Bunburyist,” after a nonexistent friend he pretends to have, a chronic invalid named Bunbury, to whose deathbed he is forever being summoned whenever he wants to get out of some tiresome social obligation.
At the beginning of Act 1, Jack drops in unexpectedly on Algernon and announces that he intends to propose to Gwendolen. Algernon confronts him with the cigarette case and forces him to come clean, demanding to know who “Jack” and “Cecily” are. Jack confesses that his name isn’t really Ernest and that Cecily is his ward, a responsibility imposed on him by his adoptive father’s will. Jack also tells Algernon about his fictional brother. Jack says he’s been thinking of killing off this fake brother, since Cecily has been showing too active an interest in him. Without meaning to, Jack describes Cecily in terms that catch Algernon’s attention and make him even more interested in her than he is already.
Gwendolen and her mother, Lady Bracknell, arrive, which gives Jack an opportunity to propose to Gwendolen. Jack is delighted to discover that Gwendolen returns his affections, but he is alarmed to learn that Gwendolen is fixated on the name Ernest, which she says “inspires absolute confidence.” Gwendolen makes clear that she would not consider marrying a man who was not named Ernest.
Lady Bracknell interviews Jack to determine his eligibility as a possible son-in-law, and during this interview she asks about his family background. When Jack explains that he has no idea who his parents were and that he was found, by the man who adopted him, in a handbag in the cloakroom at Victoria Station, Lady Bracknell is scandalized. She forbids the match between Jack and Gwendolen and sweeps out of the house.
In Act 2, Algernon shows up at Jack’s country estate posing as Jack’s brother Ernest. Meanwhile, Jack, having decided that Ernest has outlived his usefulness, arrives home in deep mourning, full of a story about Ernest having died suddenly in Paris. He is enraged to find Algernon there masquerading as Ernest but has to go along with the charade. If he doesn’t, his own lies and deceptions will be revealed.
While Jack changes out of his mourning clothes, Algernon, who has fallen hopelessly in love with Cecily, asks her to marry him. He is surprised to discover that Cecily already considers that they are engaged, and he is charmed when she reveals that her fascination with “Uncle Jack’s brother” led her to invent an elaborate romance between herself and him several months ago. Algernon is less enchanted to learn that part of Cecily’s interest in him derives from the name Ernest, which, unconsciously echoing Gwendolen, she says “inspires absolute confidence.”
Algernon goes off in search of Dr. Chasuble, the local rector, to see about getting himself christened Ernest. Meanwhile, Gwendolen arrives, having decided to pay Jack an unexpected visit. Gwendolen is shown into the garden, where Cecily orders tea and attempts to play hostess. Cecily has no idea how Gwendolen figures into Jack’s life, and Gwendolen, for her part, has no idea who Cecily is. Gwendolen initially thinks Cecily is a visitor to the Manor House and is disconcerted to learn that Cecily is “Mr. Worthing’s ward.” She notes that Ernest has never mentioned having a ward, and Cecily explains that it is not Ernest Worthing who is her guardian but his brother Jack and, in fact, that she is engaged to be married to Ernest Worthing. Gwendolen points out that this is impossible as she herself is engaged to Ernest Worthing. The tea party degenerates into a war of manners.
Jack and Algernon arrive toward the climax of this confrontation, each having separately made arrangements with Dr. Chasuble to be christened Ernest later that day. Each of the young ladies points out that the other has been deceived: Cecily informs Gwendolen that her fiancé is really named Jack and Gwendolen informs Cecily that hers is really called Algernon. The two women demand to know where Jack’s brother Ernest is, since both of them are engaged to be married to him. Jack is forced to admit that he has no brother and that Ernest is a complete fiction. Both women are shocked and furious, and they retire to the house arm in arm.
Act 3 takes place in the drawing room of the Manor House, where Cecily and Gwendolen have retired. When Jack and Algernon enter from the garden, the two women confront them. Cecily asks Algernon why he pretended to be her guardian’s brother. Algernon tells her he did it in order to meet her. Gwendolen asks Jack whether he pretended to have a brother in order to come into London to see her as often as possible, and she interprets his evasive reply as an affirmation. The women are somewhat appeased but still concerned over the issue of the name. However, when Jack and Algernon tell Gwendolen and Cecily that they have both made arrangements to be christened Ernest that afternoon, all is forgiven and the two pairs of lovers embrace. At this moment, Lady Bracknell’s arrival is announced.
Lady Bracknell has followed Gwendolen from London, having bribed Gwendolen’s maid to reveal her destination. She demands to know what is going on. Gwendolen again informs Lady Bracknell of her engagement to Jack, and Lady Bracknell reiterates that a union between them is out of the question. Algernon tells Lady Bracknell of his engagement to Cecily, prompting her to inspect Cecily and inquire into her social connections, which she does in a routine and patronizing manner that infuriates Jack. He replies to all her questions with a mixture of civility and sarcasm, withholding until the last possible moment the information that Cecily is actually worth a great deal of money and stands to inherit still more when she comes of age. At this, Lady Bracknell becomes genuinely interested.
Jack informs Lady Bracknell that, as Cecily’s legal guardian, he refuses to give his consent to her union with Algernon. Lady Bracknell suggests that the two young people simply wait until Cecily comes of age, and Jack points out that under the terms of her grandfather’s will, Cecily does not legally come of age until she is thirty-five. Lady Bracknell asks Jack to reconsider, and he points out that the matter is entirely in her own hands. As soon as she consents to his marriage to Gwendolen, Cecily can have his consent to marry Algernon. However, Lady Bracknell refuses to entertain the notion. She and Gwendolen are on the point of leaving when Dr. Chasuble arrives and happens to mention Cecily’s governess, Miss Prism. At this, Lady Bracknell starts and asks that Miss Prism be sent for.
When the governess arrives and catches sight of Lady Bracknell, she begins to look guilty and furtive. Lady Bracknell accuses her of having left her sister’s house twenty-eight years before with a baby and never returned. She demands to know where the baby is. Miss Prism confesses she doesn’t know, explaining that she lost the baby, having absentmindedly placed it in a handbag in which she had meant to place the manuscript for a novel she had written. Jack asks what happened to the bag, and Miss Prism says she left it in the cloakroom of a railway station. Jack presses her for further details and goes racing offstage, returning a few moments later with a large handbag. When Miss Prism confirms that the bag is hers, Jack throws himself on her with a cry of “Mother!” It takes a while before the situation is sorted out, but before too long we understand that Jack is not the illegitimate child of Miss Prism but the legitimate child of Lady Bracknell’s sister and, therefore, Algernon’s older brother. Furthermore, Jack had been originally christened “Ernest John.” All these years Jack has unwittingly been telling the truth: Ernest is his name, as is Jack, and he does have an unprincipled younger brother—Algernon. Again the couples embrace, Miss Prism and Dr. Chasuble follow suit, and Jack acknowledges that he now understands “the vital Importance of Being Earnest.”"
Dishonorable,"Lord Jim is the story of a man named Marlow's struggle to tell and to understand the life story of a man named Jim. Jim is a promising young man who goes to sea as a youth. He rises quickly through the ranks and soon becomes chief mate. Raised on popular sea literature, Jim constantly daydreams about becoming a hero, yet he has never faced any real danger. Finally, his chance comes. He is serving aboard a vessel called the Patna, carrying Muslim pilgrims to Mecca, when the ship strikes an underwater object and springs a leak. With a storm approaching, the crew abandons her and her passengers to their fate. Jim, not thinking clearly, abandons the ship with the rest of the crew. The Patna does not sink, however, and Jim, along with the rest of the officers, is subjected to an official inquiry by his fellow seamen. It is at this inquiry, where Jim is stripped of his officer's certification, that he first meets Marlow.
Seeing something in Jim that he recognizes, or perhaps fears, in himself, Marlow strikes up a tortured friendship with Jim. Jim tells him his story, and Marlow helps him obtain a series of jobs. The Patna incident haunts him, though; each time it is mentioned, Jim flees his current situation, enlisting Marlow's help once again. Finally, with the help of Stein, an expatriate trader, Marlow gets Jim situated as post manager in the remote territory of Patusan. Jim is initially captured by one of the warring factions of the area, but soon escapes and finally becomes a hero by defeating a local bandit. He falls in love with Jewel, the beautiful, half-native stepdaughter of the previous trading post manager, a bitter little man called Cornelius. Jim becomes the spiritual leader of Patusan. Its citizens place their trust in him and rely on him to enforce justice.
One day, Gentleman Brown, a pirate, shows up in Patusan with his crew in search of provisions. A skirmish ensues, and Brown holes up atop a hill. Cornelius, annoyed by Jim's success and his own failures, secretly meets with Brown and a conspiracy, including a dissenting Patusan faction, is formed against Jim. Jim, unaware of the plot, agrees to let Brown leave the area peacefully (Brown guesses at Jim's dishonorable past, and Jim decides it would be still more dishonorable to kill Brown simply because Brown knows the truth about him). Cornelius guides Brown down an alternate river channel, which leads him to the camp of Dain Waris, the son of Jim's closest ally, Doramin. Brown and his men ambush the camp, killing Dain Waris. Jim, realizing that he has still not been able to escape his initial failure aboard the Patna, ignores Jewel's pleas and goes to Doramin's compound, where the grieving father shoots and kills him.
Much of the novel is concerned with Marlow's attempts to piece together Jim's story from a variety of sources. Finally, he recounts the story to a group of acquaintances. At this point in time, though, Brown has not yet come to Patusan, and the story remains unfinished. Once events are completed, Marlow writes them down in manuscript form, which he then sends to a member of the audience of the first part of the story. The novel fragments time, and Marlow juxtaposes different, non-chronological pieces of Jim's story for maximum effect, all the while seeking to discover the source of his own fascination with Jim and the meaning behind the story."
Footprints,"In 1959 an overzealous Baptist minister named Nathan Price drags his wife and four daughters deep into the heart of the Congo on a mission to save the unenlightened souls of Africa. The five women narrate the novel. From the outset, the attitudes of the five women cover a wide spectrum. The mother, Orleanna passively accepts the turn of events, as she passively accepts everything her husband tells her. Fifteen-year-old beauty queen Rachel resents her separation from normal teen life. Five year old adventurer Ruth May is both excited and frightened. Fourteen-year-old Leah, who alone shares her father's ardent religious faith, is enthusiastic. Leah's twin Adah a cripple and mute by birth, but also a brilliant observer, merely views the move, as she does all of life, with a wry and cynical detachment. One thing that the women share, however, is the unwavering faith that they are carrying with them a culture far superior to the one already existing in the village of Kilanga, and that they will therefore instantly be masters of their new domain.
It does not take long for this faith to begin to waver. The first sign that they have miscalculated the superiority of their way of life comes when Nathan attempts to plant a vegetable garden. His ""demonstration garden"" is intended to both provide food for his family, and to instruct the natives in simple agricultural principles that might save them from malnutrition. However, though his garden grows lush and huge, none of his plants ever bear fruit. It takes him several weeks to realize that his plants cannot bear fruit here, because there are no African pollinators suited to North American vegetables. The next, and much larger, blow comes when their live-in helper, Mama Tataba becomes so enraged at Nathan's insistence on baptism for the villagers that she deserts them. As Mama Tataba explains in her final burst of anger, the villagers will never agree to being dunked in the river because a crocodile recently ate a young girl in that very river.
Though the women are shaken by these events, and slowly affected by the culture around them, Nathan remains steadfast in his original goals. He refuses to give up the attempt to baptize the villagers, or to bend his will in any way. When the only English-speaking member of the village, the handsome young school teacher, Anatole, informs Nathan that the chief, Tata Ndu, looks askance at his proselytizing, and fears that a move toward Christianity will spell the moral decline of his people, Nathan becomes outraged and throws Anatole out of his house rather than trying to gather more insight from him into the traditional religious life of the village. Even when their situation becomes mortally dangerous, Nathan clings tenaciously to his mission. Though little progress is being made in Kilanga, tremendous shifts are taking place elsewhere in the Congo. As the Underdowns, the Price's contacts to the Mission League, inform them on a surprise visit, Belgium is about to give the country its independence; a popular election will be held to select the new ruler. The Underdowns warn the Prices that they must evacuate the country, as purges of all Westerners are expected to take place once independence is won. Though his wife and daughters plead with him to heed this suggestion, Nathan refuses. The day that the evacuation plane arrives, and Nathan forbids his family to board, Orleanna crawls into bed and finds herself unable or unwilling to get up.
For several weeks, Orleanna lies in bed, and the three older girls must find a way to feed and care for the family themselves. When Orleanna finally pulls herself together she is a changed woman. She speaks her mind to Nathan, instead of cowering before him, and she begins to search desperately for a way to get her daughters out of Africa. She attempts to bribe the mercenary pilot Eeben Axelroot to fly them home, but he refuses to work without cash up front.
In the meantime, Leah is slowly falling in love with the schoolteacher Anatole, and falling out of love with her father and his simplistic view of right and wrong, while Adah is falling in love with the subtle language of Lingala. Rachel must pretend to be engaged to Eeben Axelroot to avoid a pity proposal of marriage from Chief Ndu, and she too finds her way into slight, and self- serving, infatuation. Ruth May falls ill with malaria, and when she recovers she is a pale, shadowy version of her old self.
A dry spell hits Kilanga and the people begin to starve. They organize a tremendous hunt, and controversy breaks out over whether Leah, who has become an excellent marksman under her friend Nelson's direction, can partake. The issue is put to a vote, which goes in favor of Leah's participation. Chief Ndu and the village's religious leader Tata Kuvundu are outraged by the idea of a woman participating in the hunt. Tata Kuvundu ominously warns that because they have overturned the natural world order, the animals will turn on them. The next evening Anatole finds an evil sign outside of his hut, and awakes the following morning to find a poisonous mamba snake curled up beside his bed.
After the hunt, Nelson finds an evil sign outside of his home, which happens to be the Price's chicken coop, and begs to spend the night in their house. Nathan refuses his request, but the girls take pity on his whimpering and join him outside. Taking a cue from one of their father's sermons, they spread the ground with ash, hoping to catch the footprints of the person planting poisonous snakes in the homes of those connected to the Prices. The next morning, when they sneak out to the chicken coop, they see the six-toed footprints of Tata Kuvundu, as well as a green mamba snake lying in the corner. Nelson pokes the snake with a pole, and it slithers out the door and past them. However, on its way out, it bites Ruth May on the shoulder, and she dies before their eyes.
In the wake of Ruth May's death, Orleanna silently leads her daughters out of Kilanga. They walk along the road in torrential rains as far as Bulungu, but then Leah falls too ill with malaria to continue on. From Bulungu, Rachel is flown to Johannesburg, South Africa by Eeben Axelroot, Adah and Orleanna make their way to the Belgian embassy in Leopoldville, and then on to Georgia, and as Leah convalesces under Anatole's care she falls wholly in love and decides to remain in the Congo as his wife. Rachel goes on to marry three men, the last of whom leaves her a luxury hotel deep in the French Congo, which she spends the rest of her life happily running. Adah goes to medical school and becomes a successful epidemiologist, taking on science as her religion. Leah and Anatole have four sons and spend their lives working toward true independence and justice for African nations. Orleanna, finally, lives her life wracked with guilt, and begging for forgiveness from Ruth May. In the last section of the book, narrated by the dead Ruth May, this forgiveness is granted."
Education,"Educated is primarily retrospective, consisting of Tara Westover's memories about her past. She tells the story of the events of her life from a vantage point in her late twenties, occasionally interjecting to comment on the process of trying to arrive at an accurate version of the past. Tara was born the youngest of seven children to parents whom she refers to as Faye and Gene (pseudonyms). The Westover family lived on a farm in rural Idaho, where Gene made a living salvaging scrap metal while Faye worked as an unlicensed midwife and herbal healer. Gene suffered from paranoid fears about interference from the federal government, and as a result he refused to allow his children to attend school, receive birth certificates, or receive medical attention. Gene was also a devout Mormon who believed in radical self-sufficiency and an impending Day of Judgement.
		
Shifts in the Westover family dynamic began to emerge when Tara was about nine. Her mother's work as a midwife increased her sense of independence, but after sustaining a serious and untreated brain injury in a car accident, Faye began to lose confidence in her skills, and focused instead on using herbal remedies and a form of intuitive healing. Around this time, Tyler (the third son) announced that he was going to attend college, which estranged him from his family. Tyler's absence forced Tara to become more involved in helping her father with his scrapping work, which left her constantly exposed to the possibility of dangerous injury. It also made her more curious about possibly pursuing an education herself. When Tara was ten, she told her disapproving father that she wanted to begin going to school, but nothing came of the idea.
As Tara grew into her teens, she acquired more independence from her family due to taking on various jobs and pursuing singing and musical theatre in the local community. However, her life was dominated by the strict rules and religious doctrine her father imposed, and Tara often worried about becoming sinful. When Tara was thirteen, her older brother Shawn moved back home. At first Shawn and Tara were close and spent a lot of time together. When Tara was about fifteen, however, Shawn began to be physically abusive toward her. His behavior only got worse after Shawn experienced a head injury. Tyler eventually realized that Shawn was hurting Tara, and he urged Tara to seriously consider applying to college and getting away from the family. Although she was uncertain at first, Tara began to study and was eventually accepted at Brigham Young University, having passed herself off as homeschooled.
In January 2004, when Tara was seventeen years old, she moved to Utah to begin her college education. She found the adjustment very difficult at first, but eventually began to excel in her studies. Tara's finances were precarious, and she had to hold multiple jobs and maintain very high grades to retain her scholarship. Her emerging independence also caused a threatening dynamic between her, Gene, and Shawn. Whenever Tara returned to Buck's Peak, her father manipulated her into working for him, while Shawn continued to physically and emotionally abuse her. Tara eventually confided to a bishop about her life, and he helped her to secure funding to finance her education. Tara's studies, and the people she met, also gradually opened her eyes to different realities and force her to realize how damaging and isolating her childhood has been. Tara eventually changed her major to studying history, and is encouraged to apply for a study abroad program at Cambridge University in England.
Tara's experience at Cambridge broadened her horizons even further, and she was encouraged to consider graduate studies. Tara still felt isolated from her peers, and ashamed of her origins. She hid most of her past even from her friends and the men she occasionally dated. She was eventually awarded a prestigious Cambridge Gates Fellowship and moved to England to pursue a Master's degree. She remained in close contact with her family and returned to Idaho regularly to visit, but her relationship with them deteriorated. Shawn was growing increasingly erratic and violent, and Tara feared for the safety of his wife and young child. By chance, she revealed to her sister Audrey that Shawn had been abusive with her, and Audrey later confided that Shawn abused her as well. Audrey blamed herself for not protecting her younger sister, and suggested that she and Tara confront their parents and Shawn about what happened to them.
By then Tara had built a happy life for herself in England, and was working on a PhD in history at Cambridge. However, the attempt to speak the truth quickly became a source of conflict in the family. Tara became more and more ostracized within her family, eventually culminating in Shawn learning that she had been telling their parents about the abuse she suffered. Realizing her family would never trust her claims, Tara became estranged from most of them, with the exception of Tyler.  The estrangement from her family prompted grief and depression for Tara, but she was finally able to heal, and successfully completed her PhD. By the end of her memoir, Tara has accepted that she may never have a relationship with her family again, but she takes pride in the independence she has established, and the life she has built for herself."

Calmness,"Gene Forrester is a quiet, intellectual student at the Devon School in New Hampshire. During the summer session of 1942, he becomes close friends with his daredevil roommate Finny, whose innate charisma consistently allows him to get away with mischief. Finny prods Gene into making a dangerous jump out of a tree into a river, and the two start a secret society based on this ritual. Gene gradually begins to envy Finny’s astonishing athletic abilities, manifested in Finny’s breaking a school swimming record on his first try. He thinks that Finny, in turn, envies his superior academic achievements, and he suspects that his friend has been taking steps to distract him from his studies. Gene’s suspicions transform into resentful hatred, but he nevertheless carefully maintains an appearance of friendship.
Gene realizes that he has been grievously mistaken about the existence of any rivalry between them when, one day, Finny expresses a sincere desire to see Gene succeed. While still in a state of shock from the force of his realization, he accompanies Finny to the tree for their jumping ritual. When Finny reaches the edge of the branch, Gene’s knees bend, shaking the branch and causing Finny to fall to the bank and shatter his leg. The tragedy is generally considered an accident, and no one thinks to blame Gene—especially not Finny. But when the doctor tells Gene that Finny’s athletic days are over, Gene feels a piercing sense of guilt. He goes to see Finny and begins to admit his part in Finny’s fall, but the doctor interrupts him, and Finny is sent home before Gene gets another chance to confess.
The summer session ends, and Gene goes home to the South for a brief vacation. On his way back to school, he stops by Finny’s house and explains to his friend that he shook the branch on purpose. Finny refuses to listen to him, and Gene rescinds his confession and continues on to school. There, Gene attempts to avoid true athletic activity by becoming assistant manager of the crew team, but he feuds with the crew manager and quits. World War II is in full swing and the boys at Devon are all eager to enlist in the military. Brinker Hadley, a prominent class politician, suggests to Gene that they enlist together, and Gene agrees. That night, however, he finds Finny has returned to school. He consequently abandons his plans to enlist, as does Brinker. Finny expects Gene to take his place as the school’s sports star now that he is injured. When Gene protests that sports no longer seem important in the midst of the war, Finny declares that the war is nothing but a conspiracy to keep young men from eclipsing the older authorities.
Finny tells Gene that he once had aspirations to go to the Olympics, and Gene agrees to train for the 1944 Olympics in his place. All the boys are surprised when a gentle, nature-loving boy named Leper Lepellier becomes the first one in their class to enlist. Gene and Finny go on training, shielded within their private vision of world events. During a winter carnival, which Finny has organized, a telegram arrives for Gene from Leper, saying that he has “escaped” and desperately needs Gene to come to his home in Vermont. Gene goes to Vermont and finds that Leper has gone slightly mad. Leper, who was present at Finny’s accident, reveals that he knows the truth about what happened. Leper’s ranting frightens Gene and makes him anxious about how he himself might react to military life. He runs away back to Devon. When Brinker hears of what has happened to Leper, he laments in front of Finny that Devon has already lost two of its potential soldiers—Leper and the crippled Finny. Gene, afraid that Finny will be hurt by this remark, tries to raise his spirits by getting him to discuss his conspiracy theory again, but Finny now denies the war only ironically.
Brinker, who has harbored suspicions that Gene might have been partly responsible for Finny’s accident, wants to prove or disprove them definitively. He organizes an after-hours tribunal of schoolboys and has Gene and Finny summoned without warning. The boys on the makeshift tribunal question the two about the circumstances surrounding the fall. Finny’s perceptions of the incident remain so blurred that he cannot speak conclusively on the matter; Gene maintains that he doesn’t remember the details of it. The boys now bring in Leper, who was sighted earlier in the day skulking about the bushes, and Leper begins to implicate Gene. Finny declares that he does not care about the facts and rushes out of the room. Hurrying on the stairs, he falls and breaks his leg again.
Gene sneaks over to the school’s infirmary that night to see Finny, who angrily sends him away. Gene wanders the campus until he falls asleep under the football stadium. The next morning, he goes to see Finny again, takes full blame for the tragedy, apologizes, and tries to explain that his action did not arise from hatred. Finny accepts these statements and the two are reconciled. Later, as the doctor is operating on Finny’s leg, some marrow detaches from the bone and enters Finny’s bloodstream, going directly to his heart and killing him. Gene receives the news with relative tranquility; he feels that he has become a part of Finny and will always be with him. The rest of the boys graduate and go off to enlist in relatively safe branches of the military. Gene reflects on the constant enmity that plagues the human heart—a curse from which he believes that only Finny was immune."
Recently,"Lawyer Bryan Stevenson gives a first-person account of his decades helping marginalized Americans who have been unfairly and harshly punished by the U.S. criminal justice system, which disproportionately targets people of color and poor people. At the heart of Just Mercy is the story of Walter McMillian, a Black man who was framed for the murder of a girl named Ronda Morrison, convicted, and sent to death row. 
Stevenson alternates chapters about Walter with his personal reflections on our country’s history with racial disparity and issues around incarceration. Stevenson highlights other groups of vulnerable people who have been victimized by the criminal justice system and shares the stories of the prisoners he has helped over the years. The book also follows the growth of Stevenson’s nonprofit law project, the Alabama-based Equal Justice Initiative (EJI), through its expansion from focusing on death row prisoners to helping people sentenced to life without parole. Stevenson chronicles how EJI becomes a significant force in criminal justice reform.
In 1983 as a law student, Stevenson discovers his life’s passion when he interns with the Georgia-based Southern Prisoners Defense Committee and meets his first death row prisoner. After graduation Stevenson accepts a job with the organization to represent poor prisoners, including those in Alabama who lack any public defender. He meets Walter McMillian on Alabama’s death row. Walter owns a successful business but also transgresses racial boundaries when he has an affair with a white woman. Soon after the affair becomes public, the woman’s friend, Ralph Myers, accuses Walter of committing the unsolved murder of Ronda Morrison, which has outraged the community. Law enforcement, including a racist sheriff and the district attorney, eagerly pounces on this accusation, overlooking Walter’s alibi and a lack of evidence. Instead, they actively force Ralph to stick with his story even when he tries to recant. They coerce other false witness testimonies, and—as revealed years later—actively suppress evidence.
After Stevenson and the team at EJI unsuccessfully appeal Walter’s conviction, they launch their own investigation of the crime and uncover new evidence. They find witnesses who can prove the witnesses against Walter lied as well as financial records that indicate that one of these witnesses was paid to give false testimony. Stevenson and his team also petition for and receive all records from Walter’s trial. However, their big break comes when they receive a phone call from Ralph, who now wants to make amends. Ralph admits to lying about Walter and says he was threatened by law enforcement. Stevenson wins a hearing for Walter where he can present his new evidence: Ralph’s testimony, which is confirmed by health care workers and other inmates, as well as recordings of the law enforcement team threatening Ralph if he doesn’t frame Walter. 
While the judge refuses to grant Walter relief, Stevenson continues the appeal process through the Alabama courts. The district attorney asks outside agents to investigate the murder for which Walter was convicted, and the investigators determine that Walter had nothing to do with the crime. Six weeks later, the court invalidates Walter’s conviction. Stevenson and the State file a joint motion to dismiss the charges, and Walter is set free.
Throughout the process, Stevenson and Walter become close friends, and Stevenson helps Walter upon his release, including filing a civil suit on his behalf and offering him a place to stay. Walter works with Stevenson to share his story, giving interviews and speaking at legal conferences, and Walter is even featured in a documentary. Unfortunately, Walter is diagnosed with advancing dementia and is forced to rely on family and eventually a nursing facility for his care. He dies in 2013. Stevenson gives a eulogy at his funeral and shares all he learned from Walter, particularly that we must extend mercy to everyone, even those who have not earned it.
Interspersed with chapters chronicling Walter’s narrative are stories of Stevenson’s other clients and work. His closeness with these prisoners and their horrifying circumstances makes Stevenson more determined to help and causes him to reflect on abstract issues that nevertheless imbue the criminal justice system, like humanity and mercy. Stevenson focuses on several categories of vulnerable people who become trapped in the system, including mentally ill prisoners, disabled prisoners, and poor women who give birth to stillborn babies. 
Stevenson and his team at EJI also become increasingly focused on juvenile offenders who are sometimes tried as adults despite their young age. These offenders may be given de facto death sentences by being sentenced to life without parole and face perilous circumstances when they are housed in adult prisons. Stevenson illustrates how these prisoners retain their own humanity while being forced to live under inhumane conditions. He also discusses some of the qualities common among these types of prisoners: They are generally poor and disproportionately people of color, and most of them lack adequate legal counsel. The juveniles have horrific backgrounds of abuse and neglect.
Stevenson and his team at EJI also work to change the legal system to offer more protection to marginalized people. Several of his cases end up before the U.S. Supreme Court, and he succeeds in winning rulings that ban as unconstitutional the conviction of children to life without parole and the execution of people deemed incompetent from dementia or neurological disease. EJI works to raise public awareness of issues surrounding unfair incarceration, produces groundbreaking reports on racial issues, and sets up programs to help formerly incarcerated people adjust to life on the outside.
Stevenson also reflects on the issues that surround the criminal justice system. His time spent with prisoners awaiting their execution makes him realize how inhumane it is to prepare another human to die. After decades of work, when Stevenson fails to prevent the execution of a man who suffers from an intellectual disability, he momentarily feels unable to continue his work. However, he realizes that he cannot help but be broken by his experiences and comes to understand that it is his own brokenness that allows him to more fully understand the need for mercy and to bring compassion to others. The book ends with Stevenson’s renewed commitment to helping others."
Manage,"Refugee follows the stories of three different children and their families, each attempting to flee their violent homelands, in different regions of the world and during different decades. Josef and his family flee Nazi Germany in 1938; Isabel and her family flee Cuba in 1994; and Mahmoud and his family flee Syria in 2015.
Josef Landau is a twelve-year-old boy living in Berlin. In 1938, his home is raided by Nazi storm troopers, and his father is taken to the Dachau concentration camp. Six months later, his mother receives a telegram that her husband has been released, but the family must leave Germany immediately. Josef, his sister Ruth, and his mother all travel to Hamburg to board a ship that will take them to Cuba. When Josef’s father is reunited with his family, they notice that Dachau has changed him: he is paranoid and very thin. They board the St. Louis, a large German ship, and set out.
Aboard the St. Louis, Josef’s family and the other passengers, all Jewish refugees, are treated well by Captain Schroeder and most of the ship’s crew. A few of the crew, however, openly dislike the Jewish passengers, especially Otto Schiendick, who proudly states his Nazi allegiance. When the St. Louis reaches Havana Harbor in Cuba, the ship is not allowed to dock. Josef’s father’s mental state deteriorates further, and he eventually jumps from the ship, trying to kill himself. Officer Padron, a Cuban policeman assigned to the St. Louis, saves Josef’s father. Josef’s father is taken to Havana to recover. When Officer Padron returns to the St. Louis, he is treated like a hero by the Jewish passengers. 
Eventually, the captain announces that they are not going to be allowed to dock in Havana and that the boat will be leaving. He promises the passengers that he will try to deliver them to a country other than Germany. The refugees aboard the St. Louis are delivered to England, Belgium, the Netherlands, and France. The Nazis invade France just a few months after Josef’s family arrives there. When the family is eventually caught, Josef’s mother is forced to choose which of her children will be freed and which will be sent to a concentration camp.
Isabel Fernandez is an eleven-year-old girl who lives just outside Havana in 1994. After the fall of the Soviet Union, Cuba has become inhospitable for most of its citizens under the regime of Fidel Castro. Isabel’s best friend and neighbor, Iván, is building a small boat with his father so that his family can flee to America. After a riot in Havana, Isabel’s family decides that they should also leave Cuba immediately. Isabel trades her trumpet to a fisherman for gasoline, paying her family’s way onto Iván’s family’s boat. Lito, Isabel’s grandfather, also joins them. 
The two families face many challenges as they try to cross the Caribbean Sea to Florida. A storm sweeps them to the Bahamas, where they are not allowed to disembark; Iván is attacked by sharks and eventually bleeds to death in the boat; and toward the end of the journey, Isabel’s pregnant mother goes into labor. Lito tells the story of the St. Louis and how he had to turn away so many refugees when he was a young policeman. (He is Officer Padron from Josef’s story.) Just when Miami becomes visible on the horizon, a U.S. Coast Guard boat tries to intercept the two families. Lito jumps in the water to distract the Coast Guard, and Isabel’s mother gives birth to a boy, just as they reach the shore. When Isabel is asked to play a song at her new school in America, she plays a Cuban salsa version of “The Star-Spangled Banner.”
Mahmoud Bishara is a twelve-year-old boy who lives in Aleppo, Syria in 2015. For the last few years, there has been a war in his country between the Syrian government, rebels, the Soviets, the United States and several other factions. After Mahmoud’s home is destroyed, his brother Waleed, sister Hana, and his parents drive to the border of Turkey, hoping to escape. Mahmoud’s father tells them that Germany is accepting Syrian refugees and if they can get to Greece, they will be able to travel within the European Union to reach Germany. After a violent conflict between the rebels and the Syrian government, Mahmoud and his family walk to the Turkish border. Mahmoud’s father arranges for a smuggler to take them to the island of Lesbos, in Greece. The smuggler’s raft is destroyed by rocks as they cross the Mediterranean. Mahmoud hands his sister, Hana, to another passing raft of refugees, knowing that his mother cannot hold her and swim. The family is eventually pulled from the water by the Greek Coast Guard. 
Mahmoud and his family travel through Serbia and into Hungary, where they are detained at a refugee camp that is built like a prison. Mahmoud decides that he no longer wants to be ignored and leads the refugees out of the prison, walking twelve hours to Austria. The refugees are welcomed in Austria, and Mahmoud’s family takes a train to Germany. While they travel, they ask if anyone has seen Hana. After a few weeks in Munich, Mahmoud’s family is transferred to a host family in Berlin. An elderly couple, Herr and Frau Rosenberg, welcome them into their home. Frau Rosenberg takes Mahmoud aside and tells him the story of her childhood: she is Ruth, Josef’s sister. The night that they were captured in France, Josef volunteered to be taken by the Nazis; both Josef and their mother were killed in concentration camps. Ruth promises to help Mahmoud find Hana."
Contemplations,"Margery Kempe is a well-off middle-class townswoman in the medieval English town of King’s Lynn. After the birth of her first child, Margery has a nervous breakdown, seeing hideous devils all around her. Margery recovers after having a vision of Jesus Christ, and she decides to devote her life to holiness and contemplation of God. One of the first hurdles Margery has to overcome is convincing her husband to live a life of celibacy with her—she succeeds only after having fourteen children. After the failure of a brewing business she starts, Margery becomes certain that God wants her to turn away from the world. Margery’s devotion to Jesus is highly emotional and dramatic, and she soon acquires a reputation as a religious eccentric, a potentially dangerous reputation in a time when heresy was a capital offense. Margery faces doubt and temptation, especially sexual temptation, but she perseveres and often receives guidance in her visions.
Margery makes several pilgrimages, the longest and most difficult of which is a journey to Jerusalem, with a long stopover in Rome. During the pilgrimage, Margery is shunned by her fellow travelers but is often accepted by the poor, a pattern that repeats itself throughout her life. In Jerusalem, Margery has several intense visions, and she begins to have spells in which she sobs and cries uncontrollably. These crying fits come upon her most often during religious services, but they also occur whenever she simply thinks of Jesus or sees something that reminds her of his suffering. Margery is stranded in Rome for a time after giving away her money to the poor, and she makes her way by begging. Margery’s extreme behavior begins to make her notorious, and she makes enemies among the English contingent in Rome. Eventually, Margery is given enough money to return home.
Upon her return to England, Margery does her best to live a life of devotion to Christ. As a married woman, however, she is somewhat constrained, such as by the fact that she cannot become a nun. Margery travels to various churches and holy sites in England, attracting attention wherever she goes, thanks to her public weeping and her all-white wardrobe. At times, Margery is accepted as a holy woman, and her advice and blessings are solicited. More often, she is treated as an oddity or a nuisance and mocked. On occasion, the hostile attention she draws goes beyond mockery. Traveling through the north of England, Margery is arrested several times and almost burned at the stake as a heretic, though she is saved by the intervention of the church authorities. Each time she is arrested, Margery defends herself vigorously. She is respectful to authority but firm in her beliefs, none of which are heretical, as her examiners soon see.
Margery continues to have mystical visions of Jesus, the Virgin Mary, and several saints. Margery’s devotion to Christ is particularly intense and is expressed in highly physical, even sexual, terms. In her visions, Margery often sees herself as a servant to Mary or Jesus, acting as an eyewitness to the events of the gospels. Jesus speaks to Margery in her visions of such subjects as the Trinity, the salvation and damnation of souls, and the meaning of the constant tears he sends her. Margery tries to spend as much time as she can in prayer or in conversation with her spiritual guides. Even so, her dramatic weeping in church and elsewhere continues to draw attention and, often, censure. Margery comes into particular conflict with a friar who moves to Lynn and refuses to allow Margery to hear him preach because of her disruptive weeping.
As time goes on, Margery’s husband becomes old and infirm, and Margery returns to his household to care for him. One of Margery’s sons turns from his sinful ways after much praying and beseeching by Margery, and he marries a German woman. The couple comes to England for a visit, and the son takes ill and dies, soon followed by his father. In her last extended journey, Margery accompanies her daughter-in-law (who is less than enthusiastic about being joined by her odd mother-in-law) back to Germany, only deciding to leave at the last minute. Margery’s trip overland from Germany to France is her most grueling yet, and she is again scorned by other travelers from England, to whom she turns for help. Eventually, Margery makes it to London and finally back to Lynn. Home once again, Margery, now an old woman, decides to record the story of her life and her devotions, and begins the dictation of her Book."
Crushes,"Two migrant workers, George and Lennie, have been let off a bus miles away from the California farm where they are due to start work. George is a small, dark man with “sharp, strong features.” Lennie, his companion, is his opposite, a giant of a man with a “shapeless” face. Overcome with thirst, the two stop in a clearing by a pool and decide to camp for the night. As the two converse, it becomes clear that Lennie has an intellectual disability, and is deeply devoted to George and dependent upon him for protection and guidance. George finds that Lennie, who loves petting soft things but often accidentally kills them, has been carrying and stroking a dead mouse. George angrily throws it away, fearing that Lennie might catch a disease from the dead animal. George complains loudly that his life would be easier without having to care for Lennie, but the reader senses that their friendship and devotion is mutual. He and Lennie share a dream of buying their own piece of land, farming it, and, much to Lennie’s delight, keeping rabbits. George ends the night by treating Lennie to the story he often tells him about what life will be like in such an idyllic place.
The next day, the men report to the nearby ranch. George, fearing how the boss will react to Lennie, insists that he’ll do all the talking. He lies, explaining that they travel together because they are cousins and that a horse kicked Lennie in the head when he was a child. They are hired. They meet Candy, an old “swamper,” or handyman, with a missing hand and an ancient dog, and Curley, the boss’s mean-spirited son. Curley is newly married, possessive of his flirtatious wife, and full of jealous suspicion. Once George and Lennie are alone in the bunkhouse, Curley’s wife appears and flirts with them. Lennie thinks she is “purty,” but George, sensing the trouble that could come from tangling with this woman and her husband, warns Lennie to stay away from her. Soon, the ranch-hands return from the fields for lunch, and George and Lennie meet Slim, the skilled mule driver who wields great authority on the ranch. Slim comments on the rarity of friendship like that between George and Lennie. Carlson, another ranch-hand, suggests that since Slim’s dog has just given birth, they should offer a puppy to Candy and shoot Candy’s old, good-for-nothing dog.
The next day, George confides in Slim that he and Lennie are not cousins, but have been friends since childhood. He tells how Lennie has often gotten them into trouble. For instance, they were forced to flee their last job because Lennie tried to touch a woman’s dress and was accused of rape. Slim agrees to give Lennie one of his puppies, and Carlson continues to badger Candy to kill his old dog. When Slim agrees with Carlson, saying that death would be a welcome relief to the suffering animal, Candy gives in. Carlson, before leading the dog outside, promises to do the job painlessly.
Slim goes to the barn to do some work, and Curley, who is maniacally searching for his wife, heads to the barn to accost Slim. Candy overhears George and Lennie discussing their plans to buy land, and offers his life’s savings if they will let him live there too. The three make a pact to let no one else know of their plan. Slim returns to the bunkhouse, berating Curley for his suspicions. Curley, searching for an easy target for his anger, finds Lennie and picks a fight with him. Lennie crushes Curley’s hand in the altercation. Slim warns Curley that if he tries to get George and Lennie fired, he will be the laughingstock of the farm.
The next night, most of the men go to the local brothel. Lennie is left with Crooks, the lonely, Black stable-hand, and Candy. Curley’s wife flirts with them, refusing to leave until the other men come home. She notices the cuts on Lennie’s face and suspects that he, and not a piece of machinery as Curley claimed, is responsible for hurting her husband. This thought amuses her. The next day, Lennie accidentally kills his puppy in the barn. Curley’s wife enters and consoles him. She admits that life with Curley is a disappointment, and wishes that she had followed her dream of becoming a movie star. Lennie tells her that he loves petting soft things, and she offers to let him feel her hair. When he grabs too tightly, she cries out. In his attempt to silence her, he accidentally breaks her neck.
Lennie flees back to a pool of the Salinas River that George had designated as a meeting place should either of them get into trouble. As the men back at the ranch discover what has happened and gather together a lynch party, George joins Lennie. Much to Lennie’s surprise, George is not mad at him for doing “a bad thing.” George begins to tell Lennie the story of the farm they will have together. As he describes the rabbits that Lennie will tend, the sound of the approaching lynch party grows louder. George shoots his friend in the back of the head.
When the other men arrive, George lets them believe that Lennie had the gun, and George wrestled it away from him and shot him. Only Slim understands what has really happened, that George has killed his friend out of mercy. Slim consolingly leads him away, and the other men, completely puzzled, watch them leave."
Outlaw,"During the reign of King Henry II in England, 18-year-old Robin Hood gets into a fight on the way to an archery competition, accidentally killing a forester. Robin hides from the vengeful Sheriff of Nottingham in Sherwood Forest. Over time, other outlaws join him, and he becomes the leader of their band. They vow to help others who have been unfairly oppressed or are in need, and they do so by taking from those who have wronged these people. As Robin Hood becomes more notorious in Nottingham, the Sheriff attempts to catch him but always fails. Realizing that he cannot outsmart Robin Hood, the Sheriff gives up on his aim of catching the outlaw. 
When the Sheriff holds an archery competition, Robin Hood’s right-hand man, Little John, participates in disguise. The Sheriff is so impressed that he invites Little John into his service. Little John accepts and enjoys the life of leisure while working for the Sheriff. However, he begins to miss his friends in Sherwood Forest and returns, having stolen the Sheriff’s silver. Robin Hood chastises Little John for stealing from someone who did not wrong him. Little John brings the Sheriff into Sherwood Forest, where Robin returns his silver.
While Little John goes on an errand, Robin Hood follows him, assuming that he will get off course. Robin watches as Little John fights with a tanner named Arthur a Bland, who beats Little John. Robin Hood is impressed by Arthur and invites him to join their band. As the three continue walking through the forest, they meet a man dressed in fancy clothing and attempt to rob him. However, they discover he is Robin Hood’s nephew, on the run from the law after accidentally killing his father’s steward. Robin renames his nephew Will Scarlet and invites him to join their band. 
The four men then come upon a miller, whom they play a trick on, pretending to rob him. However, the miller outsmarts them, temporarily blinding them by throwing flour into their faces. Once Robin Hood reveals himself, the miller joins their band as well. 
Later, the band finds a minstrel named Allan a Dale, whose love, Ellen, is about to marry someone else. Robin pledges to help Allan and Ellen. He finds a friar who will marry them, Friar Tuck, and interrupts the wedding ceremony. Allan and Ellen are married, and Friar Tuck joins Robin Hood’s band.
One day, Robin Hood meets a knight, Sir Richard of Lea, who is impoverished after pawning his land to the Prior of Emmet to save his son from jail. Robin steals from the wealthy Bishop of Hereford, who Little John forcefully brought to Sherwood, and uses the money to buy back Sir Richard’s lands from the greedy Prior of Emmet. Sir Richard pledges his loyalty to Robin Hood. 
Another day, while in search of adventure, Little John dresses as a friar. He meets two friars at an inn and taunts them during their travels before stealing from them. Meanwhile, Robin Hood trades clothes with a beggar and robs four other beggars who are feigning various ailments. Later he meets a corn dealer who is known to cheat those in need, whom he also robs. 
Having gained notoriety as well as respect for his archery skills, Robin Hood is invited to participate in an archery competition by Queen Eleanor. He attends, though King Henry is furious when Robin Hood wins. The king promises the queen that he will grant Robin Hood a pardon for forty days, but he sends his men after Robin while Robin is on his way back to Sherwood. Having been warned by the queen’s page, Robin Hood and his men split up. His men make it back to Sherwood Forest, but Robin finds all roads to Sherwood blocked. He meets Sir Richard, who advises Robin Hood to ask the queen for mercy. He makes this request, and Queen Eleanor allows Robin to return to Sherwood unharmed.
After a few years, King Henry dies and is succeeded by King Richard. Robin Hood ventures out of Sherwood for the first time in many years and encounters an outlaw, Guy of Gisbourne, who has been sent by the Sheriff to catch Robin Hood. Robin kills Guy of Gisbourne and dresses in his clothes. He goes to an inn, where the Sheriff is waiting for him. There Little John is set to be hanged for releasing three men who were to be killed for poaching the king’s deer. Robin Hood calls his men, and they save Little John. 
A few months later, King Richard visits Nottingham, and he and his men go in search of Robin Hood dressed as friars. They meet Robin in Sherwood Forest and reveal themselves after an archery contest. King Richard offers a place in his service to Robin Hood and his men, which they accept. 
After King Richard dies, Robin Hood returns to Sherwood Forest, where he intends to remain. However, the new king is unhappy about Robin’s departure and sends the Sheriff after him. Robin Hood kills the Sheriff and then becomes ill. He asks his cousin, a nun, to heal him. However, his cousin is afraid of being punished by the king and so cuts open a vein leading to Robin’s heart. Little John comes to Robin Hood after hearing his horn. He helps Robin shoot one last arrow and look out on Sherwood Forest before dying in Little John’s arms."
About,"The Giver is written from the point of view of Jonas, an eleven-year-old boy living in a futuristic society that has eliminated all pain, fear, war, and hatred. There is no prejudice, since everyone looks and acts basically the same, and there is very little competition. Everyone is unfailingly polite. The society has also eliminated choice: at age twelve every member of the community is assigned a job based on his or her abilities and interests. Citizens can apply for and be assigned compatible spouses, and each couple is assigned exactly two children each. The children are born to Birthmothers, who never see them, and spend their first year in a Nurturing Center with other babies, or “newchildren,” born that year. When their children are grown, family units dissolve and adults live together with Childless Adults until they are too old to function in the society. Then they spend their last years being cared for in the House of the Old until they are finally “released” from the society. In the community, release is death, but it is never described that way; most people think that after release, flawed newchildren and joyful elderly people are welcomed into the vast expanse of Elsewhere that surrounds the communities. Citizens who break rules or fail to adapt properly to the society’s codes of behavior are also released, though in their cases it is an occasion of great shame. Everything is planned and organized so that life is as convenient and pleasant as possible.
Jonas lives with his father, a Nurturer of new children, his mother, who works at the Department of Justice, and his seven-year-old sister Lily. At the beginning of the novel, he is apprehensive about the upcoming Ceremony of Twelve, when he will be given his official Assignment as a new adult member of the community. He does not have a distinct career preference, although he enjoys volunteering at a variety of different jobs. Though he is a well-behaved citizen and a good student, Jonas is different: he has pale eyes, while most people in his community have dark eyes, and he has unusual powers of perception. Sometimes objects “change” when he looks at them. He does not know it yet, but he alone in his community can perceive flashes of color; for everyone else, the world is as devoid of color as it is of pain, hunger, and inconvenience.
At the Ceremony of Twelve, Jonas is given the highly honored Assignment of Receiver of Memory. The Receiver is the sole keeper of the community’s collective memory. When the community went over to Sameness—its painless, warless, and mostly emotionless state of tranquility and harmony—it abandoned all memories of pain, war, and emotion, but the memories cannot disappear totally. Someone must keep them so that the community can avoid making the mistakes of the past, even though no one but the Receiver can bear the pain. Jonas receives the memories of the past, good and bad, from the current Receiver, a wise old man who tells Jonas to call him the Giver.
The Giver transmits memories by placing his hands on Jonas’s bare back. The first memory he receives is of an exhilarating sled ride. As Jonas receives memories from the Giver—memories of pleasure and pain, of bright colors and extreme cold and warm sun, of excitement and terror and hunger and love—he realizes how bland and empty life in his community really is. The memories make Jonas’s life richer and more meaningful, and he wishes that he could give that richness and meaning to the people he loves. But in exchange for their peaceful existence, the people of Jonas’s community have lost the capacity to love him back or to feel deep passion about anything. Since they have never experienced real suffering, they also cannot appreciate the real joy of life, and the life of individual people seems less precious to them. In addition, no one in Jonas’s community has ever made a choice of his or her own. Jonas grows more and more frustrated with the members of his community, and the Giver, who has felt the same way for many years, encourages him. The two grow very close, like a grandfather and a grandchild might have in the days before Sameness, when family members stayed in contact long after their children were grown.
Meanwhile, Jonas is helping his family take care of a problem newchild, Gabriel, who has trouble sleeping through the night at the Nurturing Center. Jonas helps the child to sleep by transmitting soothing memories to him every night, and he begins to develop a relationship with Gabriel that mirrors the family relationships he has experienced through the memories. When Gabriel is in danger of being released, the Giver reveals to Jonas that release is the same as death. Jonas’s rage and horror at this revelation inspire the Giver to help Jonas devise a plan to change things in the community forever. The Giver tells Jonas about the girl who had been designated the new Receiver ten years before. She had been the Giver’s own daughter, but the sadness of some of the memories had been too much for her and she had asked to be released. When she died, all of the memories she had accumulated were released into the community, and the community members could not handle the sudden influx of emotion and sensation. The Giver and Jonas plan for Jonas to escape the community and to actually enter Elsewhere. Once he has done that, his larger supply of memories will disperse, and the Giver will help the community to come to terms with the new feelings and thoughts, changing the society forever.
However, Jonas is forced to leave earlier than planned when his father tells him that Gabriel will be released the next day. Desperate to save Gabriel, Jonas steals his father’s bicycle and a supply of food and sets off for Elsewhere. Gradually, he enters a landscape full of color, animals, and changing weather, but also hunger, danger, and exhaustion. Avoiding search planes, Jonas and Gabriel travel for a long time until heavy snow makes bike travel impossible. Half-frozen, but comforting Gabriel with memories of sunshine and friendship, Jonas mounts a high hill. There he finds a sled—the sled from his first transmitted memory—waiting for him at the top. Jonas and Gabriel experience a glorious downhill ride on the sled. Ahead of them, they see—or think they see—the twinkling lights of a friendly village at Christmas, and they hear music. Jonas is sure that someone is waiting for them there."
Coasts,"Ten years have passed since the fall of Troy, and the Greek hero Odysseus still has not returned to his kingdom in Ithaca. A large and rowdy mob of suitors who have overrun Odysseus’s palace and pillaged his land continue to court his wife, Penelope. She has remained faithful to Odysseus. Prince Telemachus, Odysseus’s son, wants desperately to throw them out but does not have the confidence or experience to fight them. One of the suitors, Antinous, plans to assassinate the young prince, eliminating the only opposition to their dominion over the palace.
Read more about The Odyssey’s precursor, The Iliad.
Unknown to the suitors, Odysseus is still alive. The beautiful nymph Calypso, possessed by love for him, has imprisoned him on her island, Ogygia. He longs to return to his wife and son, but he has no ship or crew to help him escape. While the gods and goddesses of Mount Olympus debate Odysseus’s future, Athena, Odysseus’s strongest supporter among the gods, resolves to help Telemachus. Disguised as a friend of the prince’s grandfather, Laertes, she convinces the prince to call a meeting of the assembly at which he reproaches the suitors. Athena also prepares him for a great journey to Pylos and Sparta, where the kings Nestor and Menelaus, Odysseus’s companions during the war, inform him that Odysseus is alive and trapped on Calypso’s island. Telemachus makes plans to return home, while, back in Ithaca, Antinous and the other suitors prepare an ambush to kill him when he reaches port.
On Mount Olympus, Zeus sends Hermes to rescue Odysseus from Calypso. Hermes persuades Calypso to let Odysseus build a ship and leave. The homesick hero sets sail, but when Poseidon, god of the sea, finds him sailing home, he sends a storm to wreck Odysseus’s ship. Poseidon has harbored a bitter grudge against Odysseus since the hero blinded his son, the Cyclops Polyphemus, earlier in his travels. Athena intervenes to save Odysseus from Poseidon’s wrath, and the beleaguered king lands at Scheria, home of the Phaeacians. Nausicaa, the Phaeacian princess, shows him to the royal palace, and Odysseus receives a warm welcome from the king and queen. When he identifies himself as Odysseus, his hosts, who have heard of his exploits at Troy, are stunned. They promise to give him safe passage to Ithaca, but first they beg to hear the story of his adventures.
Odysseus spends the night describing the fantastic chain of events leading up to his arrival on Calypso’s island. He recounts his trip to the Land of the Lotus Eaters, his battle with Polyphemus the Cyclops, his love affair with the witch-goddess Circe, his temptation by the deadly Sirens, his journey into Hades to consult the prophet Tiresias, and his fight with the sea monster Scylla. When he finishes his story, the Phaeacians return Odysseus to Ithaca, where he seeks out the hut of his faithful swineherd, Eumaeus. Though Athena has disguised Odysseus as a beggar, Eumaeus warmly receives and nourishes him in the hut. He soon encounters Telemachus, who has returned from Pylos and Sparta despite the suitors’ ambush, and reveals to him his true identity. Odysseus and Telemachus devise a plan to massacre the suitors and regain control of Ithaca.
When Odysseus arrives at the palace the next day, still disguised as a beggar, he endures abuse and insults from the suitors. The only person who recognizes him is his old nurse, Eurycleia, but she swears not to disclose his secret. Penelope takes an interest in this strange beggar, suspecting that he might be her long-lost husband. Quite crafty herself, Penelope organizes an archery contest the following day and promises to marry any man who can string Odysseus’s great bow and fire an arrow through a row of twelve axes—a feat that only Odysseus has ever been able to accomplish. At the contest, each suitor tries to string the bow and fails. Odysseus steps up to the bow and, with little effort, fires an arrow through all twelve axes. He then turns the bow on the suitors. He and Telemachus, assisted by a few faithful servants, kill every last suitor.
Odysseus reveals himself to the entire palace and reunites with his loving Penelope. He travels to the outskirts of Ithaca to see his aging father, Laertes. They come under attack from the vengeful family members of the dead suitors, but Laertes, reinvigorated by his son’s return, successfully kills Antinous’s father and puts a stop to the attack. Zeus dispatches Athena to restore peace. With his power secure and his family reunited, Odysseus’s long ordeal comes to an end."
Capitol,"Katniss Everdeen has been rescued from the Quarter Quell arena, only to discover that she has become the pawn in someone else’s game. Her home, District 12, has been obliterated by the Capitol, and she now lives in District 13. Supposedly destroyed by the Capitol, District 13 is the organizing force of the rebellion. Twelve districts in Panem have taken up arms against the cruelty of President Snow and the exploitation by the Capitol. Katniss must now serve as the face of the rebellion, their Mockingjay, or forfeit the lives of her loved ones: her mother, her sister Prim, her friend Gale Hawthorne, and her fellow Hunger Games victor Peeta Mellark. She leverages her power over the rebellion’s leader, Alma Coin, to her advantage. She soon discovers that her efforts will cost her dearly.
Peeta, an 18-year-old from District 12, had been Katniss’s ally in the Seventy-Fourth annual Hunger Games. Of the twenty-four “tributes”—two children from each of Panem’s 12 districts—only one was supposed to survive and be crowned victor. Peeta’s love for Katniss had saved them both when they chose to die together rather than kill each other; they had been seconds away from eating poison berries when the gamemaker intervened and announced them both winners. To avoid the impression that their survival was an act of rebellion, the pair agreed to stage a public romance. For President Snow, this was preferable to all-out war. However, Katniss was unable to convince Snow, and the districts, that she had not set out to inspire a rebellion. The next year, in the Quarter Quell, Peeta and Katniss were sent back into the arena, along with past victors from the other districts. When Katniss and her allies, Finnick Odair and Beetee Latier, were rescued by the rebels, Peeta was left behind, and fell into the hands of the Capitol. 
By the time Peeta is rescued from the Capitol, his memory of her has been twisted so violently that he is a threat to her life. Katniss fears that the love he had for her is gone forever. Katniss finds purpose in her role as the Mockingjay, but she chafes under the scrutiny and control of rebellion leader Coin, former gamemaker Plutarch Heavensbee, and her mentor Haymitch Abernathy. Katniss seeks comfort with her friend, Gale. She is troubled, however, by his enthusiasm for the war, and his and Beetee’s inventiveness in creating new death traps for their enemies. Katniss’s affection is divided between Peeta and Gale, and she knows she will one day have to choose one of them or risk losing them both. Unable to choose, she asks to be sent into action, and hopes that she can be useful to the rebels as more than just a symbol. 
Katniss watches in horror as Gale’s tactics are used on Capitol soldiers in District 2, and she is wounded while she tries to reason with the survivors. Katniss returns to District 13 to recover, and she develops a surprising bond with her former adversary, District 8 victor Johanna Mason. The two train together, readying themselves again for combat. Katniss is assigned to an assault squad, along with Gale, Finnick, and several others. Under the command of Boggs, the squad will not see much action in the Capitol, now rigged with deadly booby traps called pods. Instead, their task is to film “propos,” under the direction of Cressida, to boost morale as the rebels close in on President Snow’s mansion.
When a member of their squad is killed, Coin sends Peeta to join Boggs’s squad in the Capitol. Boggs and Katniss both recognize this as a threat to her life, and Boggs warns Katniss not to trust the power-hungry Coin, as she is willing to do anything—including killing Katniss—to get what she wants. The squad moves forward. Boggs guides their moves, aided by a Holographic map of the pod locations. The information on the “Holo” is a few weeks old, however, and before long, several members of the squad, including Boggs, are killed. Before he dies, Boggs reassigns the Holo to Katniss, giving her command over the remaining squad members. 
Concealing her true plan, which is to assassinate President Snow herself, Katniss leads the group underground. Peeta, triggered by the chaos and carnage caused by the pods, begs Katniss to kill him. Instead, the squad works to help him distinguish what is real from what was planted in his mind by the Capitol.
Though there are fewer pods underground, the squad soon discovers they are no safer there. They are attacked by a pack of Capitol-created mutants, and more members of the squad are killed before the rest of them reach the surface. Katniss uses the self-destruct feature of the Holo to give Finnick a quick death instead of an agonizing one, and she leads Gale, Peeta and what remains of the film crew up to the streets of the Capitol. They find shelter with Tigris, a rebel sympathizer, and rest for a few days.
Peeta insists he is too much of a danger to Katniss, so the group splits up for the final phase of Katniss’s plan to kill President Snow. Katniss and Gale hide among Capitol refugees seeking shelter in Snow’s mansion. Shooting and chaos fracture the crowds, and Peacekeepers form a barrier around the mansion, using Capitol children as shields. Katniss watches in horror as a Capitol hovercraft drops a bomb on the children, then drops another bomb on the aid workers who rush in to help. Many are killed, including Katniss’s sister Primrose. Katniss herself is badly injured. Before she falls unconscious, she recognizes the bomb as one of Gale’s ideas.
During Katniss’s recovery, which is slowed by her grief over losing her sister, she learns that the rebels have won. From a conversation with Snow, who is now imprisoned and weakened by fatal illness, Katniss learns that the bomb that killed her sister was not dropped by him, but by Panem’s new president, Coin. Coin proposes that under her regime, the Hunger Games will still exist, but tributes will now come from the Capitol instead of the Districts. Peeta, Beetee, and Annie vote against reinstating the Games, but Joanna, Enobaria, Haymitch, and Katniss vote for reinstating them, the latter two doing so only to gain Coin’s trust. Katniss follows Coin to Snow’s execution. The new president has kept her promise that Katniss will be the one to kill Snow. Katniss aims her bow at Snow, but at the last moment she turns her weapon on Coin. The new president dies instantly, and Katniss is arrested.
After a few days, Haymitch comes to take Katniss home. Her trial is over, and both Coin and Snow are dead. Panem is under new leadership, and the victors are finally free to live their lives in peace. Haymitch and Katniss move back into their houses in the Victor’s Circle. Soon, Peeta joins them, and the three begin to heal. Katniss and Peeta find love with each other once again, and a new peace in the knowledge that their children will never know the nightmares of the Hunger Games."
Hardest,"Thomas Gradgrind, a wealthy, retired merchant in the industrial city of Coketown, England, devotes his life to a philosophy of rationalism, self-interest, and fact. He raises his oldest children, Louisa and Tom, according to this philosophy and never allows them to engage in fanciful or imaginative pursuits. He founds a school and charitably takes in one of the students, the kindly and imaginative Sissy Jupe, after the disappearance of her father, a circus entertainer.
	As the Gradgrind children grow older, Tom becomes a dissipated, self-interested hedonist, and Louisa struggles with deep inner confusion, feeling as though she is missing something important in her life. Eventually Louisa marries Gradgrind’s friend Josiah Bounderby, a wealthy factory owner and banker more than twice her age. Bounderby continually trumpets his role as a self-made man who was abandoned in the gutter by his mother as an infant. Tom is apprenticed at the Bounderby bank, and Sissy remains at the Gradgrind home to care for the younger children.
	In the meantime, an impoverished “Hand”—Dickens’s term for the lowest laborers in Coketown’s factories—named Stephen Blackpool struggles with his love for Rachael, another poor factory worker. He is unable to marry her because he is already married to a horrible, drunken woman who disappears for months and even years at a time. Stephen visits Bounderby to ask about a divorce but learns that only the wealthy can obtain them. Outside Bounderby’s home, he meets Mrs. Pegler, a strange old woman with an inexplicable devotion to Bounderby.
	James Harthouse, a wealthy young sophisticate from London, arrives in Coketown to begin a political career as a disciple of Gradgrind, who is now a Member of Parliament. He immediately takes an interest in Louisa and decides to try to seduce her. With the unspoken aid of Mrs. Sparsit, a former aristocrat who has fallen on hard times and now works for Bounderby, he sets about trying to corrupt Louisa.
	The Hands, exhorted by a crooked union spokesman named Slackbridge, try to form a union. Only Stephen refuses to join because he feels that a union strike would only increase tensions between employers and employees. He is cast out by the other Hands and fired by Bounderby when he refuses to spy on them. Louisa, impressed with Stephen’s integrity, visits him before he leaves Coketown and helps him with some money. Tom accompanies her and tells Stephen that if he waits outside the bank for several consecutive nights, help will come to him. Stephen does so, but no help arrives. Eventually he packs up and leaves Coketown, hoping to find agricultural work in the country. Not long after that, the bank is robbed, and the lone suspect is Stephen, the vanished Hand who was seen loitering outside the bank for several nights just before disappearing from the city.
	Mrs. Sparsit witnesses Harthouse declaring his love for Louisa, and Louisa agrees to meet him in Coketown later that night. However, Louisa instead flees to her father’s house, where she miserably confides to Gradgrind that her upbringing has left her married to a man she does not love, disconnected from her feelings, deeply unhappy, and possibly in love with Harthouse. She collapses to the floor, and Gradgrind, struck dumb with self-reproach, begins to realize the imperfections in his philosophy of rational self-interest.
	Sissy, who loves Louisa deeply, visits Harthouse and convinces him to leave Coketown forever. Bounderby, furious that his wife has left him, redoubles his efforts to capture Stephen. When Stephen tries to return to clear his good name, he falls into a mining pit called Old Hell Shaft. Rachael and Louisa discover him, but he dies soon after an emotional farewell to Rachael. Gradgrind and Louisa realize that Tom is really responsible for robbing the bank, and they arrange to sneak him out of England with the help of the circus performers with whom Sissy spent her early childhood. They are nearly successful, but are stopped by Bitzer, a young man who went to Gradgrind’s school and who embodies all the qualities of the detached rationalism that Gradgrind once espoused, but who now sees its limits. Sleary, the lisping circus proprietor, arranges for Tom to slip out of Bitzer’s grasp, and the young robber escapes from England after all.
	Mrs. Sparsit, anxious to help Bounderby find the robbers, drags Mrs. Pegler—a known associate of Stephen Blackpool—in to see Bounderby, thinking Mrs. Pegler is a potential witness. Bounderby recoils, and it is revealed that Mrs. Pegler is really his loving mother, whom he has forbidden to visit him: Bounderby is not a self-made man after all. Angrily, Bounderby fires Mrs. Sparsit and sends her away to her hostile relatives. Five years later, he will die alone in the streets of Coketown. Gradgrind gives up his philosophy of fact and devotes his political power to helping the poor. Tom realizes the error of his ways but dies without ever seeing his family again. While Sissy marries and has a large and loving family, Louisa never again marries and never has children. Nevertheless, Louisa is loved by Sissy’s family and learns at last how to feel sympathy for her fellow human beings."
Ordered,"Harry Potter is spending another tedious summer with his dreadful Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon when a group of evil spirits called “dementors” stage an unexpected attack on Harry and his cousin Dudley. After using magic to defend himself, Harry is visited by a group of wizards and whisked off to number twelve, Grimmauld Place, London. Number twelve is the home of Harry’s godfather, Sirius Black, and the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix. The Order is a group of wizards, led by Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore, dedicated to fighting evil Lord Voldemort and his followers. The Order is forced to operate in secrecy, outside of the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Magic, which is headed by the dense and corrupt Cornelius Fudge. Fudge refuses to believe that Lord Voldemort has returned.
Harry used magic to fight off the dementors, and since underage wizards are not permitted to use their wands outside of school, he must face a disciplinary hearing at the Ministry. With Dumbledore’s help, Harry is cleared and permitted to return to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. 
Reunited with his best friends, Ron and Hermione, Harry returns to Hogwarts and learns that Dolores Umbridge, an employee of Fudge, will be his new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. The Sorting Hat, which traditionally sorts all new students into one of four houses, cautions the students against becoming too internally divided. Meanwhile, the wizard newspaper, the Daily Prophet, continues printing untrue and unfair stories about Harry. Many of his classmates are whispering about him behind his back, but Harry ignores them and tries to concentrate on his studies, since all fifth-year students at Hogwarts are required to take O.W.L.s, or Ordinary Wizarding Level examinations. 
Umbridge refuses to teach her students how to perform Defense spells, and before long, Fudge appoints her High Inquisitor of Hogwarts, giving her the authority to inspect all faculty members and evaluate their skills. In desperation, Harry, Hermione, and Ron form their own Defense Against the Dark Arts group, also known as the D.A., or Dumbledore’s Army. Twenty-five other students sign up, and they meet as often as possible to learn and practice Defense spells. Harry wishes desperately to contact his godfather Sirius to discuss the situation, but Umbridge is inspecting all Owl Mail and patrolling the fires that students can use to make contact with wizards residing outside of Hogwarts. Umbridge openly dislikes Harry, whom she considers a liar, and eventually bans him from the Gryffindor Quidditch team. Ron’s twin brothers, Fred and George, storm out of Hogwarts in protest, moving to London where they plan to open a joke shop using the money Harry won last year in the Triwizard Tournament.
Harry continues to have upsetting dreams about walking down a corridor at the Department of Mysteries, deep inside the Ministry of Magic. At the end of the corridor, Harry goes through several doors and enters a room full of dusty glass spheres. Harry always wakes up before he finds out what the dream means or what the spheres signify. One night, Harry has a vision where he inhabits the body of a large snake, and attacks Ron’s father. Harry wakes up horrified, and Professor McGonagall takes him to Dumbledore immediately. Dumbledore uses the portraits on the walls of his office to raise an alert, and Mr. Weasley is promptly rescued by two members of the Order. Dumbledore then demands that Harry take Occlumency lessons with Professor Snape, which should help Harry protect his mind against further invasions by Lord Voldemort. 
Harry is unsuccessful at Occlumency because he has such difficulty clearing his mind of all thoughts, making it difficult for him to focus on closing his mind off to all outside influence. Meanwhile, his scar (from the attack in which Voldemort killed Harry’s parents) burns horribly every time Voldemort experiences a powerful emotion. The D.A. continues to meet regularly, and Harry’s peers show great improvement until they are caught by Umbridge. Dumbledore takes full responsibility for the group and resigns as Headmaster. Umbridge takes over his position. The students begin taking their O.W.L. exams, and Harry has another vision, this time about Sirius being held captive and tortured by Voldemort. Horrified, Harry becomes determined to save him. Hermione warns Harry that Voldemort may be deliberately trying to lure Harry to the Department of Mysteries, but Harry is too concerned about Sirius to take any chances. 
Harry sneaks into Umbridge’s office, and, using her fireplace, transports himself to Twelve Grimmauld Place to look for Sirius. Kreacher, the Black house elf, tells Harry that Sirius is at the Ministry of Magic. Harry returns to Hogwarts to find that he and his friends have been caught in Umbridge’s office. Hermione and Harry convince Umbridge to follow them into the forest, where they claim to be hiding a weapon for Dumbledore. Once in the forest, Centaurs carry Umbridge away. Harry and his friends climb aboard flying horses called thestrals and speed off to the Ministry. Once they arrive, Harry cannot find Sirius and realizes that Hermione was right. Harry also sees that one of the glass spheres has his name on it, as well as Voldemort’s. Harry grabs the sphere, and Death Eaters surround to attack, demanding that Harry hand over the prophecy. Employing all of their Defense skills, Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Luna, and Neville have moderate success fighting the Death Eaters, but they are ultimately helped enormously by the arrival of several members of the Order. In the midst of the fight, Harry drops the glass sphere, and it shatters. Meanwhile, Sirius’ own cousin, Death Eater Bellatrix Lestrange, kills Sirius. Harry is devastated.
Dumbledore appears and corrals the Death Eaters. Voldemort and Lestrange escape, just as Fudge shows up. Dumbledore sends Harry back to school, where he explains how the sphere was a prophecy, which stated that Harry has a power that Voldemort does not know about. Dumbledore explains that this power is love. The prophecy goes on to claim that Harry will either destroy Voldemort or be destroyed by him. Dumbledore takes this opportunity to tell Harry why he must spend his summers with the Durselys in Little Whinging. Because Harry’s mother died to save him, he is blessed with her love, a blessing that can be sealed only by blood. Harry’s Aunt Petunia, his mother’s sister, makes that bond complete by taking Harry into her home. As long as he still calls Little Whinging home, Harry is safe. With this news, Harry returns to his Aunt and Uncle’s house for one more miserable summer."
Brotherhood,"Winston Smith is a low-ranking member of the ruling Party in London, in the nation of Oceania. Everywhere Winston goes, even his own home, the Party watches him through telescreens; everywhere he looks he sees the face of the Party’s seemingly omniscient leader, a figure known only as Big Brother. The Party controls everything in Oceania, even the people’s history and language. Currently, the Party is forcing the implementation of an invented language called Newspeak, which attempts to prevent political rebellion by eliminating all words related to it. Even thinking rebellious thoughts is illegal. Such thoughtcrime is, in fact, the worst of all crimes.
As the novel opens, Winston feels frustrated by the oppression and rigid control of the Party, which prohibits free thought, sex, and any expression of individuality. Winston dislikes the party and has illegally purchased a diary in which to write his criminal thoughts. He has also become fixated on a powerful Party member named O’Brien, whom Winston believes is a secret member of the Brotherhood—the mysterious, legendary group that works to overthrow the Party.
Winston works in the Ministry of Truth, where he alters historical records to fit the needs of the Party. He notices a coworker, a beautiful dark-haired girl, staring at him, and worries that she is an informant who will turn him in for his thoughtcrime. He is troubled by the Party’s control of history: the Party claims that Oceania has always been allied with Eastasia in a war against Eurasia, but Winston seems to recall a time when this was not true. The Party also claims that Emmanuel Goldstein, the alleged leader of the Brotherhood, is the most dangerous man alive, but this does not seem plausible to Winston. Winston spends his evenings wandering through the poorest neighborhoods in London, where the proletarians, or proles, live squalid lives, relatively free of Party monitoring.
One day, Winston receives a note from the dark-haired girl that reads “I love you.” She tells him her name, Julia, and they begin a covert affair, always on the lookout for signs of Party monitoring. Eventually they rent a room above the secondhand store in the prole district where Winston bought the diary. This relationship lasts for some time. Winston is sure that they will be caught and punished sooner or later (the fatalistic Winston knows that he has been doomed since he wrote his first diary entry), while Julia is more pragmatic and optimistic. As Winston’s affair with Julia progresses, his hatred for the Party grows more and more intense. At last, he receives the message that he has been waiting for: O’Brien wants to see him.
Winston and Julia travel to O’Brien’s luxurious apartment. As a member of the powerful Inner Party (Winston belongs to the Outer Party), O’Brien leads a life of luxury that Winston can only imagine. O’Brien confirms to Winston and Julia that, like them, he hates the Party, and says that he works against it as a member of the Brotherhood. He indoctrinates Winston and Julia into the Brotherhood, and gives Winston a copy of Emmanuel Goldstein’s book, the manifesto of the Brotherhood. Winston reads the book—an amalgam of several forms of class-based twentieth-century social theory—to Julia in the room above the store. Suddenly, soldiers barge in and seize them. Mr. Charrington, the proprietor of the store, is revealed as having been a member of the Thought Police all along.
Torn away from Julia and taken to a place called the Ministry of Love, Winston finds that O’Brien, too, is a Party spy who simply pretended to be a member of the Brotherhood in order to trap Winston into committing an open act of rebellion against the Party. O’Brien spends months torturing and brainwashing Winston, who struggles to resist. At last, O’Brien sends him to the dreaded Room 101, the final destination for anyone who opposes the Party. Here, O’Brien tells Winston that he will be forced to confront his worst fear. Throughout the novel, Winston has had recurring nightmares about rats; O’Brien now straps a cage full of rats onto Winston’s head and prepares to allow the rats to eat his face. Winston snaps, pleading with O’Brien to do it to Julia, not to him.
Giving up Julia is what O’Brien wanted from Winston all along. His spirit broken, Winston is released to the outside world. He meets Julia but no longer feels anything for her. He has accepted the Party entirely and has learned to love Big Brother."
Faults,"Seventeen-year-old Hazel Grace Lancaster reluctantly attends a cancer patients' support group at her mother’s behest. Because of her cancer, she uses a portable oxygen tank to breathe properly. In one of the meetings she catches the eye of a teenage boy, and through the course of the meeting she learns the boy’s name is Augustus Waters. He's there to support their mutual friend, Isaac. Isaac had a tumor in one eye that he had removed, and now he has to have his other eye taken out as well. After the meeting ends, Augustus approaches Hazel and tells her she looks like Natalie Portman in V for Vendetta. He invites Hazel to his house to watch the movie, and while hanging out, the two discuss their experiences with cancer. Hazel reveals she has thyroid cancer that has spread to her lungs. Augustus had osteosarcoma, but he is now cancer free after having his leg amputated. Before Augustus takes Hazel home, they agree to read one another’s favorite novels. Augustus gives Hazel The Price of Dawn, and Hazel recommends An Imperial Affliction.
Hazel explains the magnificence of An Imperial Affliction: It is a novel about a girl named Anna who has cancer, and it's the only account she's read of living with cancer that matches her experience. She describes how the novel maddeningly ends midsentence, denying the reader closure about the fate of the novel’s characters. She speculates about the novel’s mysterious author, Peter Van Houten, who fled to Amsterdam after the novel was published and hasn’t been heard from since.
A week after Hazel and Augustus discuss the literary meaning of An Imperial Affliction, Augustus miraculously reveals he tracked down Van Houten's assistant, Lidewij, and through her he's managed to start an email correspondence with the reclusive author. He shares Van Houten's letter with Hazel, and she devises a list of questions to send Van Houten, hoping to clear up the novel’s ambiguous conclusion. Hazel is most concerned with the fate of Anna’s mother. She figures that if Anna’s mother survives her daughter’s death, then her own parents will be alright after Hazel dies. Van Houten eventually replies, saying he could only answer Hazel’s questions in person. He invites her to stop by if she is ever in Amsterdam.
Shortly after Augustus invites Hazel on a picnic. It turns out he's planned an elaborate Dutch-themed picnic where he reveals that a charitable foundation that grants the wishes of kids with cancer has agreed to grant his: he's taking the two of them to Amsterdam to meet Van Houten. She is thrilled, but when he touches her face she feels hesitant for some reason. Over time she realizes that she likes him a lot, but she knows she'll hurt him when she dies. She compares herself to a grenade.
In the midst of her struggle over what to do about Augustus, Hazel suffers a serious episode in which her lungs fill with fluid and she goes to the ICU. When she is released after a period of days, she learns that Augustus never left the hospital’s waiting room. He delivers Hazel another letter from Van Houten, this one more personal and more cryptic than the last. After reading the letter, Hazel is more determined than ever to go to Amsterdam. There is a problem though: Her parents and her team of doctors don’t think Hazel is strong enough to travel. The situation seems hopeless until one of the physicians most familiar with her case, Dr. Maria, convinces Hazel’s parents that Hazel must travel because she needs to live her life.
The plans are made for Augustus, Hazel, and Hazel's mother to go to Amsterdam, but when Hazel and Augustus meet Van Houten they find that, instead of a prolific genius, he is a mean-spirited drunk who claims he cannot answer any of Hazel’s questions. The two leave Van Houten’s in utter disappointment, and accompanied by Lidewij, who feels horrified by Van Houten's behavior, they tour Anne Frank’s house. At the end of the tour, Augustus and Hazel share a romantic kiss, to the applause of spectators. They head back to the hotel where they make love for the first and only time. The following day, Augustus confesses that while Hazel was in the ICU he had a body scan which revealed his cancer has returned and spread everywhere. They return to Indianapolis, and Hazel realizes Augustus is now the grenade. As his condition worsens he is less prone to his typical charm and confidence. He becomes vulnerable and scared, but is still a beautiful boy in Hazel’s mind. As this change occurs, she ceases calling him Augustus and starts referring to him as just Gus, as his parents do. Hazel recognizes that she loves him now as much as ever. Augustus’s condition deteriorates quickly. In his final days Augustus arranges a prefuneral for himself, and Isaac and Hazel give eulogies. Hazel steals a line from Van Houten about larger and smaller infinities. She says how much she loves Augustus, and that she would not trade their short time together for anything in the world.
Augustus dies eight days later. Hazel is astonished to find Van Houten at the funeral. Van Houten explains that he and Gus maintained correspondence and that Augustus demanded Van Houten make up for ruining the trip to Amsterdam by coming to his funeral to see Hazel. Van Houten abstractly reveals the fate of Anna’s mother, but Hazel is not interested. A few days later Isaac informs Hazel that Augustus was writing something for her. He had hinted about writing a sequel to An Imperial Affliction for her, and as Hazel scrambles to locate the pages she encounters Van Houten once more. He drunkenly reveals that Anna was the name of his daughter. She died of cancer when she was eight, and An Imperial Affliction was his literary attempt at reconciling himself with her death. Hazel tells Van Houten to sober up and write another book.
Eventually Hazel learns that Augustus sent the pages to Van Houten because he wanted Van Houten to use the pages to compose a well-written eulogy about Hazel. Lidewij forces Van Houten to read the pages and sends them straight off to Hazel. The novel concludes with Hazel reading Augustus’s words. He says getting hurt in this world is inevitable, but we do get to choose who we allow to hurt us, and that he his happy with his choice. He hopes she likes her choice too. The final words of the novel come from Hazel, who says she does."
Invading,"Refugee follows the stories of three different children and their families, each attempting to flee their violent homelands, in different regions of the world and during different decades. Josef and his family flee Nazi Germany in 1938; Isabel and her family flee Cuba in 1994; and Mahmoud and his family flee Syria in 2015.
Josef Landau is a twelve-year-old boy living in Berlin. In 1938, his home is raided by Nazi storm troopers, and his father is taken to the Dachau concentration camp. Six months later, his mother receives a telegram that her husband has been released, but the family must leave Germany immediately. Josef, his sister Ruth, and his mother all travel to Hamburg to board a ship that will take them to Cuba. When Josef’s father is reunited with his family, they notice that Dachau has changed him: he is paranoid and very thin. They board the St. Louis, a large German ship, and set out.
Aboard the St. Louis, Josef’s family and the other passengers, all Jewish refugees, are treated well by Captain Schroeder and most of the ship’s crew. A few of the crew, however, openly dislike the Jewish passengers, especially Otto Schiendick, who proudly states his Nazi allegiance. When the St. Louis reaches Havana Harbor in Cuba, the ship is not allowed to dock. Josef’s father’s mental state deteriorates further, and he eventually jumps from the ship, trying to kill himself. Officer Padron, a Cuban policeman assigned to the St. Louis, saves Josef’s father. Josef’s father is taken to Havana to recover. When Officer Padron returns to the St. Louis, he is treated like a hero by the Jewish passengers. 
Eventually, the captain announces that they are not going to be allowed to dock in Havana and that the boat will be leaving. He promises the passengers that he will try to deliver them to a country other than Germany. The refugees aboard the St. Louis are delivered to England, Belgium, the Netherlands, and France. The Nazis invade France just a few months after Josef’s family arrives there. When the family is eventually caught, Josef’s mother is forced to choose which of her children will be freed and which will be sent to a concentration camp.
Isabel Fernandez is an eleven-year-old girl who lives just outside Havana in 1994. After the fall of the Soviet Union, Cuba has become inhospitable for most of its citizens under the regime of Fidel Castro. Isabel’s best friend and neighbor, Iván, is building a small boat with his father so that his family can flee to America. After a riot in Havana, Isabel’s family decides that they should also leave Cuba immediately. Isabel trades her trumpet to a fisherman for gasoline, paying her family’s way onto Iván’s family’s boat. Lito, Isabel’s grandfather, also joins them. 
The two families face many challenges as they try to cross the Caribbean Sea to Florida. A storm sweeps them to the Bahamas, where they are not allowed to disembark; Iván is attacked by sharks and eventually bleeds to death in the boat; and toward the end of the journey, Isabel’s pregnant mother goes into labor. Lito tells the story of the St. Louis and how he had to turn away so many refugees when he was a young policeman. (He is Officer Padron from Josef’s story.) Just when Miami becomes visible on the horizon, a U.S. Coast Guard boat tries to intercept the two families. Lito jumps in the water to distract the Coast Guard, and Isabel’s mother gives birth to a boy, just as they reach the shore. When Isabel is asked to play a song at her new school in America, she plays a Cuban salsa version of “The Star-Spangled Banner.”
Mahmoud Bishara is a twelve-year-old boy who lives in Aleppo, Syria in 2015. For the last few years, there has been a war in his country between the Syrian government, rebels, the Soviets, the United States and several other factions. After Mahmoud’s home is destroyed, his brother Waleed, sister Hana, and his parents drive to the border of Turkey, hoping to escape. Mahmoud’s father tells them that Germany is accepting Syrian refugees and if they can get to Greece, they will be able to travel within the European Union to reach Germany. After a violent conflict between the rebels and the Syrian government, Mahmoud and his family walk to the Turkish border. Mahmoud’s father arranges for a smuggler to take them to the island of Lesbos, in Greece. The smuggler’s raft is destroyed by rocks as they cross the Mediterranean. Mahmoud hands his sister, Hana, to another passing raft of refugees, knowing that his mother cannot hold her and swim. The family is eventually pulled from the water by the Greek Coast Guard. 
Mahmoud and his family travel through Serbia and into Hungary, where they are detained at a refugee camp that is built like a prison. Mahmoud decides that he no longer wants to be ignored and leads the refugees out of the prison, walking twelve hours to Austria. The refugees are welcomed in Austria, and Mahmoud’s family takes a train to Germany. While they travel, they ask if anyone has seen Hana. After a few weeks in Munich, Mahmoud’s family is transferred to a host family in Berlin. An elderly couple, Herr and Frau Rosenberg, welcome them into their home. Frau Rosenberg takes Mahmoud aside and tells him the story of her childhood: she is Ruth, Josef’s sister. The night that they were captured in France, Josef volunteered to be taken by the Nazis; both Josef and their mother were killed in concentration camps. Ruth promises to help Mahmoud find Hana."
Leave,"A middle-class family, Amanda, Clay, and their teenage children, thirteen-year-old Rose and sixteen-year-old Archie, drive from their home in Brooklyn to a luxurious but remote Airbnb in Long Island for their summer vacation. They swim in the pool, stock up on groceries, and spend a day at the beach, but on the second night, their tranquility is disrupted by the arrival of an older Black couple who claim to own the house, G.H. and Ruth Washington. They also claim there’s been a blackout in New York City. Amanda is suspicious, in large part because Ruth and G. H. are Black, but she and Clay let the couple stay in the basement apartment. 
They awake to four news alerts on Amanda’s phone, the last one in gibberish. The TVs, Internet, and landline don’t work but they still have electricity. In the light of day, Amanda is less suspicious of the Washingtons and they begin to make small talk. It emerges that the Washingtons are wealthy and well-connected. As the adults talk, Rose sees dozens of deer in the woods behind the house, not realizing there are thousands of the animals gathering. Clay offers to drive to town to find out what is going on, but gets lost after stopping to smoke a cigarette. The others gather around the pool as if nothing has happened. The kids play with pool floats, Amanda and Ruth make sandwiches for lunch, and G. H. relaxes in the hot tub. 
Rose and Archie go exploring and find a shed. Archie scares Rose with a story of a sinister man who sleeps in the shed, then they wander into the woods. Meanwhile, Clay is still lost and begins to panic. He comes across a Spanish-speaking woman in evident distress on the road and drives away without helping her. Out in the quiet woods, the children spot another house but don’t approach it. Poolside, Amanda worries that Clay isn’t back. While she and G.H. are talking, an unidentifiable, ear-splitting noise terrifies them all. It is loud enough to make hairline fractures in the house’s plate glass doors. Amanda screams and runs to find her children, who are running home in fear. The noise terrifies Clay and makes him long for the safety of the house. Suddenly, he recognizes his surroundings and sets off for home. When the others ask where he has been, he lies because he is ashamed that he got lost. He doesn’t mention the woman on the roadside or his panic when he couldn’t find his way back to the house. Instead, he says he smoked a cigarette and came home when he heard the noise. 
Archie takes a shower and feels hot and sleepy afterward. It begins to rain, and Rose wishes their vacation could have lasted one more day. Ruth prepares to do laundry and considers asking Amanda to put hers in too, while Rose decides to bake a cake. Amanda asks Clay to fill the bathtubs as an emergency precaution after G. H. confirms that a power outage would mean they can’t get water. They discuss going home or to town but decide to wait. Amanda finds Archie asleep and feverish. He vomits and they decide to take him to their doctor in Brooklyn the next day. That night feels almost like a party, as the adults indulge in lots of food and alcohol. Ruth sees Amanda and Clay almost as friends now, herself as host. Amanda and Clay begin packing, then have sex to feel better. Amanda goes outside naked and G. H., in a swimsuit, joins her in the hot tub. Clay, also naked, brings drinks. A flock of flamingos lands in the yard and the pool, and everyone speculates about what their presence means. They go back inside and hear the terrible noise again. 
Amanda, Clay, and their children huddle in bed together. Amanda and Clay wake up feeling terrible and hungover. Amanda vomits a pinkish fluid and Clay has diarrhea. When Archie wakes up, five of his teeth fall out. Clay consults Ruth and G. H., who agree Archie needs to go to the hospital. Clay doesn’t know the way, so G. H. agrees to go with him even though Ruth wants G. H. to stay with her at the house. Then Amanda notices that Rose is gone. They search for her, but when Archie collapses and starts vomiting pinkish fluid, G. H., Clay, and Archie leave for the hospital. Ruth and Amanda argue as they search for Rose. Afterward, Amanda apologizes to Ruth and wants to hug her but doesn’t. 
Instead of going to the hospital, G. H. drives to the home of Danny, his contractor and supposed friend. Danny thinks a war has broken out and he offers them no help. His harsh demeanor makes it clear that he tolerated G. H. when he was making money from him, but he does not consider him a friend. In Danny’s mind, he dislikes G. H. for the same reasons he dislikes Barack Obama. To G. H.’s disappointment, Danny refuses to help or even to let them inside, but he warns them that the best thing to do is to stay home and wait. Instead of going to the hospital, they decide to return to the house. 
Unaware that people are looking for her, Rose is in the woods on a mission to do something helpful. Following the example set by the books and movies she loves, she believes they shouldn’t panic but prepare. She walks to the house she and Archie found in the woods. When nobody answers the door, she breaks in and explores the place, imagining her family could live there. She puts on a DVD to listen to as she takes stock of the food and other supplies. Then she heads back with a full bag of provisions and news of the vacant house."
Contracted,"Candide is the illegitimate nephew of a German baron. He grows up in the baron’s castle under the tutelage of the scholar Pangloss, who teaches him that this world is “the best of all possible worlds.” Candide falls in love with the baron’s young daughter, Cunégonde. The baron catches the two kissing and expels Candide from his home. On his own for the first time, Candide is soon conscripted into the army of the Bulgars. He wanders away from camp for a brief walk, and is brutally flogged as a deserter. After witnessing a horrific battle, he manages to escape and travels to Holland.
	In Holland, a kindly Anabaptist named Jacques takes Candide in. Candide runs into a deformed beggar and discovers that it is Pangloss. Pangloss explains that he has contracted syphilis and that Cunégonde and her family have all been brutally murdered by the Bulgar army. Nonetheless, he maintains his optimistic outlook. Jacques takes Pangloss in as well. The three travel to Lisbon together, but before they arrive their ship runs into a storm and Jacques is drowned. Candide and Pangloss arrive in Lisbon to find it destroyed by an earthquake and under the control of the Inquisition. Pangloss is soon hanged as a heretic, and Candide is flogged for listening with approval to Pangloss’s philosophy. After his beating, an old woman dresses Candide’s wounds and then, to his astonishment, takes him to Cunégonde. Cunégonde explains that though the Bulgars killed the rest of her family, she was merely raped and then captured by a captain, who sold her to a Jew named Don Isaachar. At present, she is a sex slave jointly owned by Don Isaachar and the Grand Inquisitor of Lisbon. Each of Cunégonde’s two owners arrive in turn as she and Candide are talking, and Candide kills them both. Terrified, Candide, the old woman, and Cunégonde flee and board a ship bound for South America. During their journey, the old woman relates her own story. She was born the Pope’s daughter but has suffered a litany of misfortunes that include rape, enslavement, and cannibalism.
	Candide and Cunégonde plan to marry, but as soon as they arrive in Buenos Aires, the governor, Don Fernando, proposes to Cunégonde. Thinking of her own financial welfare, she accepts. Authorities looking for the murderer of the Grand Inquisitor arrive from Portugal in pursuit of Candide. Along with a newly acquired valet named Cacambo, Candide flees to territory controlled by Jesuits who are revolting against the Spanish government. After demanding an audience with a Jesuit commander, Candide discovers that the commander is Cunégonde’s brother, the baron, who also managed to escape from the Bulgars. Candide announces that he plans to marry Cunégonde, but the baron insists that his sister will never marry a commoner. Enraged, Candide runs the baron through with his sword. He and Cacambo escape into the wilderness, where they narrowly avoid being eaten by a native tribe called the Biglugs.
	After traveling for days, Candide and Cacambo find themselves in the land of Eldorado, where gold and jewels litter the streets. This utopian country has advanced scientific knowledge, no religious conflict, no court system, and places no value on its plentiful gold and jewels. But Candide longs to return to Cunégonde, and after a month in Eldorado he and Cacambo depart with countless invaluable jewels loaded onto swift pack sheep. When they reach the territory of Surinam, Candide sends Cacambo to Buenos Aires with instructions to use part of the fortune to purchase Cunégonde from Don Fernando and then to meet him in Venice. An unscrupulous merchant named Vanderdendur steals much of Candide’s fortune, dampening his optimism somewhat. Frustrated, Candide sails off to France with a specially chosen companion, an unrepentantly pessimistic scholar named Martin. On the way there, he recovers part of his fortune when a Spanish captain sinks Vanderdendur’s ship. Candide takes this as proof that there is justice in the world, but Martin staunchly disagrees.
	In Paris, Candide and Martin mingle with the social elite. Candide’s fortune attracts a number of hangers-on, several of whom succeed in filching jewels from him. Candide and Martin proceed to Venice, where, to Candide’s dismay, Cunégonde and Cacambo are nowhere to be found. However, they do encounter other colorful individuals there, including Paquette, the chambermaid-turned-prostitute who gave Pangloss syphilis, and Count Pococurante, a wealthy Venetian who is hopelessly bored with the cultural treasures that surround him. Eventually, Cacambo, now a slave of a deposed Turkish monarch, surfaces. He explains that Cunégonde is in Constantinople, having herself been enslaved along with the old woman. Martin, Cacambo, and Candide depart for Turkey, where Candide purchases Cacambo’s freedom.
	Candide discovers Pangloss and the baron in a Turkish chain gang. Both have actually survived their apparent deaths and, after suffering various misfortunes, arrived in Turkey. Despite everything, Pangloss remains an optimist. An overjoyed Candide purchases their freedom, and he and his growing retinue go on to find Cunégonde and the old woman. Cunégonde has grown ugly since Candide last saw her, but he purchases her freedom anyway. He also buys the old woman’s freedom and purchases a farm outside of Constantinople. He keeps his longstanding promise to marry Cunégonde, but only after being forced to send the baron, who still cannot abide his sister marrying a commoner, back to the chain gang. Candide, Cunégonde, Cacambo, Pangloss, and the old woman settle into a comfortable life on the farm but soon find themselves growing bored and quarrelsome. Finally, Candide encounters a farmer who lives a simple life, works hard, and avoids vice and leisure. Inspired, Candide and his friends take to cultivating a garden in earnest. All their time and energy goes into the work, and none is left over for philosophical speculation. At last everyone is fulfilled and happy."
Decency,"Joe Bonham lies injured in a hospital bed. While conscious, Joe thinks back over scenes from his past: the night of his father's death and the night before he left his girlfriend Kareen to go to World War I. Before his family moved to Los Angeles, Joe grew up in Shale City, a small town in Colorado. He remembers small-town memories and images, such as the food his mother would prepare, the first time an airplane came to Shale City, and the night he lost his girlfriend, Diane, to his best friend, Bill Harper.
The narrative shifts from the past to the present as Joe thinks regretfully about his decision to join a war that was not any of his business. Slowly, Joe begins to realize that he has been severely injured and treated in a hospital, which is where he currently lies. Joe gradually feels that his arms and legs have been amputated. Furthermore, he realizes that he cannot speak, see, hear, or smell because he no longer has a face—only a mask covering where his face used to be. Joe wonders bitterly abut the doctors' motivation for saving him at all.
Joe continues to live inside his head, reliving memories and terrorized by nightmares. He wonders how he can even tell whether he is awake or asleep. Joe thinks about his father kept beautiful gardens in a vacant city lot and fed his children well, although he was never officially a success because he never made any money. Joe continues to think bitterly about the foolishness of fighting and dying in a war that had nothing to do with him, and about the deceitfulness of abstract words like ""liberty,"" ""democracy,"" ""freedom,"" and ""decency.""
Time passes, and Joe tries to occupy his mind with stories, facts, and figures. One day, he realizes that he should use the skin he has left—the skin of his neck that is not covered by blankets—to try to sense the outside world. Joe develops a plan to wait for the feeling of sunrise so that he can tally the nurses' visits and count the passing of the days. A year later, Joe has accomplished his goal and counted up 365 days. He celebrates the New Year in his mind, just as he has celebrated each Sunday of his year with an imagined walk in the woods.
In Joe's fourth year, he is amazed to feel that the hospital staff is prepared him to be shown to visitors. When he feels the visitors lay something on his chest, he realizes he is being given a medal. Joe becomes angry and shudders in his bed, trying to remove his mask to show the visitors how much damage men like him sustained in the war while generals emerged unscathed. Joe feels the vibrations of the men leaving the room. An idea comes upon him that if he can sense the outside world through vibrations, perhaps he might also communicate to the outside world with vibrations. Joe begins tapping SOS in Morse code with his head, but his regular nurse assumes that he is having seizures and sedates him.
Joe awakens from his sedation to realize that he has a new day nurse. The new day nurse tries to communicate with Joe by spelling out ""MERRY CHRISTMAS"" on his chest. Joe signals with his head that he understands, and he begins trying to tap Morse code to her. After trying to appease his tapping by making him more comfortable in various ways, the nurse eventually realizes he is trying to communicate in words.
The nurse goes to get a man who understands Morse code. This man taps onto Joe's forehead the words ""WHAT DO YOU WANT?"" Joe spends some time thinking about the inappropriateness of the question and then tries to think about what in fact it is that he wants. Joe asks in Morse code to be taken around the outside world as an educational exhibit on the realities of war. The man listens to his response and returns a while later to tap into his head, ""WHAT YOU ASK IS AGAINST REGULATIONS.""
The man continues tapping other messages, but Joe is no longer paying attention. He is still trying to process this betrayal on the part of the people for whom he fought a war when he feels the hospital staff sedating him again. Joe taps the question ""why? why? why?""—wondering why they will not let him talk or acknowledge that there is still a person inside his mangled body. Joe suddenly realizes that they are afraid to let him out, to let other men see him as the ""new messiah of the battlefields."" If other men see Joe, they would no longer agree to fight in wars—especially wars ordered by the upper classes, but fought only by the lower classes of peaceful, working men."
1790,"Born 1706 in Boston, Benjamin Franklin was the 15th of his father's 17 children. He went to school as a child with the intent of becoming a minister, as his father, Josiah, intended. However, that idea was dropped after Franklin showed a keen interest in reading and writing. He was apprenticed to his brother, James at a young age, but after fighting with his brother he quit the job and moved to Philadelphia, where he worked for a man named Samuel Keimer. After befriending some prominent political figures, including the royal Governor, Franklin left for England, where he spent 18 months working for a printer with his friend James Ralph, with whom he later became estranged.
Shortly after returning to America in 1726, Franklin formed a debating club called the Junto. Two years later, he took over The Pennsylvania Gazette from Keimer and turned it into a successful publication with tools from London. In 1730, Franklin wed his old sweetheart, Deborah Read, with whom he had two children. The first, William Franklin, was born approximately one year later; he is the man to whom the Autobiography is addressed in Part One.
Throughout the 1730s, Franklin held some minor positions doing printing work for the government. In that time, he began Poor Richard's Almanac and became postmaster of Philadelphia. Towards the end of the decade, he invented the Franklin stove. In the 1740s, Franklin worked on several projects, including the fire brigade, the police force, the University of Pennsylvania, the street sweeping service and some other smaller public works projects.
Franklin retired from the printing business in 1748 and began to conduct scientific experiments in lightning. In 1753, he was awarded honorary degrees from Harvard and Yale, and he became Postmaster General of America. The following year, when war broke out between England and France (the French and Indian War). Franklin began to draft proposals outlining means by which funds could be raised for colonial defense. He succeeded in many of his proposals, and he personally played a large part in organizing the war effort. The Autobiography, however, breaks off in 1757; it is left unfinished.
The Autobiography itself was written in three different times: 1771 in England, 1783-83 in France, and 1788 in America. If Franklin meant to complete it, he died before he got the chance."
Limits,"In a collection of essays, Malcolm Gladwell explores the relationship between power and prestige on the one hand and weakness and struggle on the other. Two theses run through the essays in David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants. The first thesis is that in a contest where one side is obviously superior to the other by conventional standards, the weaker side often has one or more underappreciated advantages. The second thesis is that too much strength can be a bad thing—a phenomenon represented graphically by an inverted-U curve: as strength increases along the horizontal axis, the benefit, on the vertical axis, at first rises but eventually begins to fall.
The Introduction and Part One develop both claims. The first example of hidden advantage on the weaker side is David, the Biblical shepherd boy, who uses a simple sling to overcome the heavily armored and physically imposing warrior Goliath. Later examples include an unskilled girls’ basketball team that wins games with the full-court press, and T. E. Lawrence and his Bedouin guerillas, who use sabotage and surprise to defeat the Turkish army during the First World War.
The moral is that weakness encourages innovation. The basketball team, for instance, adopts the full-court press because the team stands no chance of winning by playing the way other teams do. Gladwell also considers the value of being a Big Fish in a Little Pond instead of a Little Fish in a Big Pond. The French Impressionists found success by creating a Little Pond for themselves, in the form of a self-staged exhibition. Similarly, a college student choosing between a prestigious school and a less-prestigious one will often have a better experience, and will be more successful, at the latter.
A chapter primarily about school class sizes illustrates the concept of the inverted-U curve. According to conventional wisdom, students learn more in small classes than in large ones. This is true, according to Gladwell, for class sizes above twenty-five or so. But a class size of fifteen is smaller than ideal. Family income also illustrates the point: more income is good when it enables a family to afford necessities, but not when the added income makes it harder for parents to say “no” to their children.
Part Two of David and Goliath develops both themes further. Under the right circumstances, personal difficulty can promote the development of valuable skills. Gladwell illustrates this point using several people who grew up with dyslexia. Dyslexia forced trial lawyer David Boies to become an unusually good listener, and it forced film producer Brian Grazer to become an exceptional negotiator. In IKEA founder Ingvar Kamprad and investment banker Gary Cohn, dyslexia fostered a willingness to be “disagreeable”—to do things other disapprove of, like doing business in a communist country or lying your way into a job. A tragically deprived childhood had the same effect on medical pioneer Emil Freireich, who was willing to try treatment techniques that shocked and appalled his colleagues.
Brushes with danger can cause people to become physically more courageous. Here, Gladwell’s examples include the survivors of the London Blitz in World War II and civil rights leader Fred Shuttlesworth. Many of the examples in this section are also examples of inventiveness born of necessity. Freireich, for example, had to find ways to keep his young patients alive when existing techniques were of little use. Wyatt Walker, coordinator of the Birmingham civil rights protests, had to find a way to goad police chief Bull Connor into a response that would attract the country’s attention.
Part Three and the Afterword focus on the limits of government power. Again, the lesson of the inverted-U curve regularly applies. In Belfast, Northern Ireland, in the 1960s, the British government found that applying overwhelming force without establishing legitimacy in the eyes of the population was counterproductive. Conversely, a New York police unit demonstrated that legitimacy makes traditional policing techniques more effective. When it comes to the punishment of violent crime, Gladwell argues that overly harsh sentencing policies, like California’s Three Strikes law, do more harm than good. He makes his case partly with statistics and partly by describing the contrasting ways in which two parents of different murder victims each coped with their loss.
Gladwell’s last two examples are from times of war. During World War II, officials of Vichy France recognized the limits of their power when a small village openly refused to cooperate in the arrest and deportation of Jews. And during the Vietnam War, the U.S. government learned that despite the recommendations of a confident analyst from the RAND corporation, overwhelming financial and material superiority did not guarantee victory over the Viet Cong."
Raised,"A Raisin in the Sun portrays a few weeks in the life of the Youngers, a Black family living on the South Side of Chicago in the 1950s. When the play opens, the Youngers are about to receive an insurance check for $10,000. This money comes from the deceased Mr. Younger’s life insurance policy. Each of the adult members of the family has an idea as to what he or she would like to do with this money. The matriarch of the family, Mama, wants to buy a house to fulfill a dream she shared with her husband. Mama’s son, Walter Lee, would rather use the money to invest in a liquor store with his friends. He believes that the investment will solve the family’s financial problems forever. Walter’s wife, Ruth, agrees with Mama, however, and hopes that she and Walter can provide more space and opportunity for their son, Travis. Finally, Beneatha, Walter’s sister and Mama’s daughter, wants to use the money for her medical school tuition. She also wishes that her family members were not so interested in assimilating into the white world. Beneatha instead tries to find her identity by looking back to the past and to Africa.
As the play progresses, the Youngers clash over their competing dreams. Ruth discovers that she is pregnant but fears that if she has the child, she will put more financial pressure on her family members. When Walter says nothing to Ruth’s admission that she is considering abortion, Mama puts a down payment on a house for the whole family. She believes that a bigger, brighter dwelling will help them all. This house is in Clybourne Park, an entirely white neighborhood. When the Youngers’ future neighbors find out that the Youngers are moving in, they send Mr. Lindner, from the Clybourne Park Improvement Association, to offer the Youngers money in return for staying away. The Youngers refuse the deal, even after Walter loses the rest of the money ($6,500) to his friend Willy Harris, who persuades Walter to invest in the liquor store and then runs off with his cash.
In the meantime, Beneatha rejects her suitor, George Murchison, whom she believes to be shallow and blind to the problems of race. Subsequently, she receives a marriage proposal from her Nigerian boyfriend, Joseph Asagai, who wants Beneatha to get a medical degree and move to Africa with him (Beneatha does not make her choice before the end of the play). The Youngers eventually move out of the apartment, fulfilling the family’s long-held dream. Their future seems uncertain and slightly dangerous, but they are optimistic and determined to live a better life. They believe that they can succeed if they stick together as a family and resolve to defer their dreams no longer."
Initiate,"A youth named Equality 7-2521, who has found a hidden tunnel and hides in it to write, knows his solitude violates all the laws of his society. Even though he does not feel guilt for his actions, he begs the forgiveness of the ruling Council. As he spends more time alone, he realizes that solitude suits him, and he begins to crave more and more time by himself. From his tunnel, Equality 7-2521 records episodes from his childhood. As a child, Equality 7-2521 wanted more than anything to be a scholar. He believed he was cursed with a terrific curiosity, which made him prefer some things to others and to prefer some people to others. He often fought with the boys at the Home of Students, and he was reprimanded by his teachers for being too smart and too tall. He tried to conform to the standard the others set, but no matter how hard he tried, he was smarter and quicker than they were. When the Council of Vocations assigned him to be a street sweeper instead of a scholar, he was pleased because it meant he could atone for the sins he had committed.
When he was ten, Equality 7-2521 saw the public execution of the Transgressor of the Unspeakable Word, who had discovered the word “I” and was burned to death in the town square as punishment for using the word. While he was burning, the Transgressor showed no pain but locked eyes with Equality 7-2521. Equality 7-2521 comes to believe that that moment anointed him as a disciple of the same crusade as the Transgressor.
Equality 7-2521 begins to conduct experiments and shortly discovers electricity. After many weeks of work, he successfully builds a lightbulb from the materials he finds in his tunnel. He decides that he must share his invention with the world and resolves to present it to the World Council of Scholars when it convenes that year in his city.
In the meantime, Equality 7-2521 has met the Golden One, a beautiful peasant girl who is proud and haughty. He knows it is wrong to do so, but he speaks to her when he gets the chance, and they immediately fall in love. One day, she offers him some water from her hands, and he drinks it, not understanding why this act makes him think of the Palace of Mating, where he and all other mature citizens are sent once a year to have sex.
Before he can show the lightbulb to the World Council, Equality 7-2521 accidentally returns late to the Home of the Street Sweepers, where he lives. When he refuses to tell his Home Council where he has been, he is thrown into the Palace of Corrective Detention. There he is tortured, but he still refuses to tell where he has been, because he wants to keep the lightbulb a secret until he gets to show it to the World Council. He remains incarcerated until the World Council convenes, when he breaks out of the Palace of Corrective Detention and goes to the World Council, expecting to be exonerated and reconciled with his brothers.
When Equality 7-2521 arrives and tells the World Council his story, however, the World Council rejects him out of fear and anger. It threatens to kill him and to get rid of his lightbulb. He cannot abide having his lightbulb destroyed, so he grabs his invention and flees the city. He runs to the Uncharted Forest where he discovers that he is free at last to do as he pleases.
A few days later, the Golden One appears. She has followed Equality 7-2521 into the woods. They vow to live together in peace and solitude. After they have been hiking for several days in the mountains, they find an abandoned house from the Unmentionable Times. The Golden One revels in the finery she finds in the house, and Equality 7-2521 consumes the library. He discovers the meaning of the word “I,” and he vows to protect his home and from there launch a new race of men who will believe in individualism and the never-ending supremacy of the ego."
Colorable,"Celie, the protagonist and narrator of The 	Color Purple, is a poor, uneducated, fourteen-year-old black girl living in rural Georgia. Celie starts writing letters to God because her father, Alphonso, beats and rapes her. Alphonso has already impregnated Celie once. Celie gave birth to a girl, whom her father stole and presumably killed in the woods. Celie has a second child, a boy, whom her father also steals. Celie’s mother becomes seriously ill and dies. Alphonso brings home a new wife but continues to abuse Celie.
Celie and her bright, pretty younger sister, Nettie, learn that a man known only as Mr. ______ wants to marry Nettie. Mr. ______ has a lover named Shug Avery, a sultry lounge singer whose photograph fascinates Celie. Alphonso refuses to let Nettie marry, and instead offers Mr. ______ the “ugly” Celie as a bride. Mr. ______ eventually accepts the offer, and takes Celie into a difficult and joyless married life. Nettie runs away from Alphonso and takes refuge at Celie’s house. Mr. ______ still desires Nettie, and when he advances on her she flees for her own safety. Never hearing from Nettie again, Celie assumes she is dead.
Mr. ______’s sister Kate feels sorry for Celie, and tells her to fight back against Mr. ______ rather than submit to his abuses. Harpo, Mr. ______’s son, falls in love with a large, spunky girl named Sofia. Shug Avery comes to town to sing at a local bar, but Celie is not allowed to go see her. Sofia becomes pregnant and marries Harpo. Celie is amazed by Sofia’s defiance in the face of Harpo’s and Mr. ______’s attempts to treat Sofia as an inferior. Harpo’s attempts to beat Sofia into submission consistently fail, as Sofia is by far the physically stronger of the two.
Shug falls ill and Mr. ______ takes her into his house. Shug is initially rude to Celie, but the two women become friends as Celie takes charge of nursing Shug. Celie finds herself infatuated with Shug and attracted to her sexually. Frustrated with Harpo’s consistent attempts to subordinate her, Sofia moves out, taking her children. Several months later, Harpo opens a juke joint where Shug sings nightly. Celie grows confused over her feelings toward Shug.
Shug decides to stay when she learns that Mr. ______ beats Celie when Shug is away. Shug and Celie’s relationship grows intimate, and Shug begins to ask Celie questions about sex. Sofia returns for a visit and promptly gets in a fight with Harpo’s new girlfriend, Squeak. In town one day, the mayor’s wife, Miss Millie, asks Sofia to work as her maid. Sofia answers with a sassy “Hell no.” When the mayor slaps Sofia for her insubordination, she returns the blow, knocking the mayor down. Sofia is sent to jail. Squeak’s attempts to get Sofia freed are futile. Sofia is sentenced to work for twelve years as the mayor’s maid.
Shug returns with a new husband, Grady. Despite her marriage, Shug instigates a sexual relationship with Celie, and the two frequently share the same bed. One night Shug asks Celie about her sister. Celie assumes Nettie is dead because she had promised to write to Celie but never did. Shug says she has seen Mr. ______ hide away numerous mysterious letters that have arrived in the mail. Shug manages to get her hands on one of these letters, and they find it is from Nettie. Searching through Mr. ______’s trunk, Celie and Shug find dozens of letters that Nettie has sent to Celie over the years. Overcome with emotion, Celie reads the letters in order, wondering how to keep herself from killing Mr. ______.
The letters indicate that Nettie befriended a missionary couple, Samuel and Corrine, and traveled with them to Africa to do ministry work. Samuel and Corrine have two adopted children, Olivia and Adam. Nettie and Corrine become close friends, but Corrine, noticing that her adopted children resemble Nettie, wonders if Nettie and Samuel have a secret past. Increasingly suspicious, Corrine tries to limit Nettie’s role within her family.
Nettie becomes disillusioned with her missionary experience, as she finds the Africans self-centered and obstinate. Corrine becomes ill with a fever. Nettie asks Samuel to tell her how he adopted Olivia and Adam. Based on Samuel’s story, Nettie realizes that the two children are actually Celie’s biological children, alive after all. Nettie also learns that Alphonso is really only Nettie and Celie’s step-father, not their real father. Their real father was a storeowner whom white men lynched because they resented his success. Alphonso told Celie and Nettie he was their real father because he wanted to inherit the house and property that was once their mother’s.
Nettie confesses to Samuel and Corrine that she is in fact their children’s biological aunt. The gravely ill Corrine refuses to believe Nettie. Corrine dies, but accepts Nettie’s story and feels reconciled just before her death. Meanwhile, Celie visits Alphonso, who -confirms Nettie’s story, admitting that he is only the women’s stepfather. Celie begins to lose some of her faith in God, but Shug tries to get her to reimagine God in her own way, rather than in the traditional image of the old, bearded white man.
The mayor releases Sofia from her servitude six months early. At dinner one night, Celie finally releases her pent-up rage, angrily cursing Mr. ______ for his years of abuse. Shug announces that she and Celie are moving to Tennessee, and Squeak decides to go with them. In Tennessee, Celie spends her time designing and sewing individually tailored pairs of pants, eventually turning her hobby into a business. Celie returns to Georgia for a visit, and finds that Mr. ______ has reformed his ways and that Alphonso has died. Alphonso’s house and land are now hers, so she moves there.
Meanwhile, Nettie and Samuel marry and prepare to return to America. Before they leave, Samuel’s son, Adam, marries Tashi, a native African girl. Following African tradition, Tashi undergoes the painful rituals of female circumcision and facial scarring. In solidarity, Adam undergoes the same facial scarring ritual.
Celie and Mr. ______ reconcile and begin to genuinely enjoy each other’s company. Now independent financially, spiritually, and emotionally, Celie is no longer bothered by Shug’s passing flings with younger men. Sofia remarries Harpo and now works in Celie’s clothing store. Nettie finally returns to America with Samuel and the children. Emotionally drained but exhilarated by the reunion with her sister, Celie notes that though she and Nettie are now old, she has never in her life felt younger."
Announces,"Jack Worthing, the play’s protagonist, is a pillar of the community in Hertfordshire, where he is guardian to Cecily Cardew, the pretty, eighteen-year-old granddaughter of the late Thomas Cardew, who found and adopted Jack when he was a baby. In Hertfordshire, Jack has responsibilities: he is a major landowner and justice of the peace, with tenants, farmers, and a number of servants and other employees all dependent on him. For years, he has also pretended to have an irresponsible black-sheep brother named Ernest who leads a scandalous life in pursuit of pleasure and is always getting into trouble of a sort that requires Jack to rush grimly off to his assistance. In fact, Ernest is merely Jack’s alibi, a phantom that allows him to disappear for days at a time and do as he likes. No one but Jack knows that he himself is Ernest. Ernest is the name Jack goes by in London, which is where he really goes on these occasions—probably to pursue the very sort of behavior he pretends to disapprove of in his imaginary brother.
Jack is in love with Gwendolen Fairfax, the cousin of his best friend, Algernon Moncrieff. When the play opens, Algernon, who knows Jack as Ernest, has begun to suspect something, having found an inscription inside Jack’s cigarette case addressed to “Uncle Jack” from someone who refers to herself as “little Cecily.” Algernon suspects that Jack may be leading a double life, a practice he seems to regard as commonplace and indispensable to modern life. He calls a person who leads a double life a “Bunburyist,” after a nonexistent friend he pretends to have, a chronic invalid named Bunbury, to whose deathbed he is forever being summoned whenever he wants to get out of some tiresome social obligation.
At the beginning of Act 1, Jack drops in unexpectedly on Algernon and announces that he intends to propose to Gwendolen. Algernon confronts him with the cigarette case and forces him to come clean, demanding to know who “Jack” and “Cecily” are. Jack confesses that his name isn’t really Ernest and that Cecily is his ward, a responsibility imposed on him by his adoptive father’s will. Jack also tells Algernon about his fictional brother. Jack says he’s been thinking of killing off this fake brother, since Cecily has been showing too active an interest in him. Without meaning to, Jack describes Cecily in terms that catch Algernon’s attention and make him even more interested in her than he is already.
Gwendolen and her mother, Lady Bracknell, arrive, which gives Jack an opportunity to propose to Gwendolen. Jack is delighted to discover that Gwendolen returns his affections, but he is alarmed to learn that Gwendolen is fixated on the name Ernest, which she says “inspires absolute confidence.” Gwendolen makes clear that she would not consider marrying a man who was not named Ernest.
Lady Bracknell interviews Jack to determine his eligibility as a possible son-in-law, and during this interview she asks about his family background. When Jack explains that he has no idea who his parents were and that he was found, by the man who adopted him, in a handbag in the cloakroom at Victoria Station, Lady Bracknell is scandalized. She forbids the match between Jack and Gwendolen and sweeps out of the house.
In Act 2, Algernon shows up at Jack’s country estate posing as Jack’s brother Ernest. Meanwhile, Jack, having decided that Ernest has outlived his usefulness, arrives home in deep mourning, full of a story about Ernest having died suddenly in Paris. He is enraged to find Algernon there masquerading as Ernest but has to go along with the charade. If he doesn’t, his own lies and deceptions will be revealed.
While Jack changes out of his mourning clothes, Algernon, who has fallen hopelessly in love with Cecily, asks her to marry him. He is surprised to discover that Cecily already considers that they are engaged, and he is charmed when she reveals that her fascination with “Uncle Jack’s brother” led her to invent an elaborate romance between herself and him several months ago. Algernon is less enchanted to learn that part of Cecily’s interest in him derives from the name Ernest, which, unconsciously echoing Gwendolen, she says “inspires absolute confidence.”
Algernon goes off in search of Dr. Chasuble, the local rector, to see about getting himself christened Ernest. Meanwhile, Gwendolen arrives, having decided to pay Jack an unexpected visit. Gwendolen is shown into the garden, where Cecily orders tea and attempts to play hostess. Cecily has no idea how Gwendolen figures into Jack’s life, and Gwendolen, for her part, has no idea who Cecily is. Gwendolen initially thinks Cecily is a visitor to the Manor House and is disconcerted to learn that Cecily is “Mr. Worthing’s ward.” She notes that Ernest has never mentioned having a ward, and Cecily explains that it is not Ernest Worthing who is her guardian but his brother Jack and, in fact, that she is engaged to be married to Ernest Worthing. Gwendolen points out that this is impossible as she herself is engaged to Ernest Worthing. The tea party degenerates into a war of manners.
Jack and Algernon arrive toward the climax of this confrontation, each having separately made arrangements with Dr. Chasuble to be christened Ernest later that day. Each of the young ladies points out that the other has been deceived: Cecily informs Gwendolen that her fiancé is really named Jack and Gwendolen informs Cecily that hers is really called Algernon. The two women demand to know where Jack’s brother Ernest is, since both of them are engaged to be married to him. Jack is forced to admit that he has no brother and that Ernest is a complete fiction. Both women are shocked and furious, and they retire to the house arm in arm.
Act 3 takes place in the drawing room of the Manor House, where Cecily and Gwendolen have retired. When Jack and Algernon enter from the garden, the two women confront them. Cecily asks Algernon why he pretended to be her guardian’s brother. Algernon tells her he did it in order to meet her. Gwendolen asks Jack whether he pretended to have a brother in order to come into London to see her as often as possible, and she interprets his evasive reply as an affirmation. The women are somewhat appeased but still concerned over the issue of the name. However, when Jack and Algernon tell Gwendolen and Cecily that they have both made arrangements to be christened Ernest that afternoon, all is forgiven and the two pairs of lovers embrace. At this moment, Lady Bracknell’s arrival is announced.
Lady Bracknell has followed Gwendolen from London, having bribed Gwendolen’s maid to reveal her destination. She demands to know what is going on. Gwendolen again informs Lady Bracknell of her engagement to Jack, and Lady Bracknell reiterates that a union between them is out of the question. Algernon tells Lady Bracknell of his engagement to Cecily, prompting her to inspect Cecily and inquire into her social connections, which she does in a routine and patronizing manner that infuriates Jack. He replies to all her questions with a mixture of civility and sarcasm, withholding until the last possible moment the information that Cecily is actually worth a great deal of money and stands to inherit still more when she comes of age. At this, Lady Bracknell becomes genuinely interested.
Jack informs Lady Bracknell that, as Cecily’s legal guardian, he refuses to give his consent to her union with Algernon. Lady Bracknell suggests that the two young people simply wait until Cecily comes of age, and Jack points out that under the terms of her grandfather’s will, Cecily does not legally come of age until she is thirty-five. Lady Bracknell asks Jack to reconsider, and he points out that the matter is entirely in her own hands. As soon as she consents to his marriage to Gwendolen, Cecily can have his consent to marry Algernon. However, Lady Bracknell refuses to entertain the notion. She and Gwendolen are on the point of leaving when Dr. Chasuble arrives and happens to mention Cecily’s governess, Miss Prism. At this, Lady Bracknell starts and asks that Miss Prism be sent for.
When the governess arrives and catches sight of Lady Bracknell, she begins to look guilty and furtive. Lady Bracknell accuses her of having left her sister’s house twenty-eight years before with a baby and never returned. She demands to know where the baby is. Miss Prism confesses she doesn’t know, explaining that she lost the baby, having absentmindedly placed it in a handbag in which she had meant to place the manuscript for a novel she had written. Jack asks what happened to the bag, and Miss Prism says she left it in the cloakroom of a railway station. Jack presses her for further details and goes racing offstage, returning a few moments later with a large handbag. When Miss Prism confirms that the bag is hers, Jack throws himself on her with a cry of “Mother!” It takes a while before the situation is sorted out, but before too long we understand that Jack is not the illegitimate child of Miss Prism but the legitimate child of Lady Bracknell’s sister and, therefore, Algernon’s older brother. Furthermore, Jack had been originally christened “Ernest John.” All these years Jack has unwittingly been telling the truth: Ernest is his name, as is Jack, and he does have an unprincipled younger brother—Algernon. Again the couples embrace, Miss Prism and Dr. Chasuble follow suit, and Jack acknowledges that he now understands “the vital Importance of Being Earnest.”"
Northern,"Northanger Abbey is the coming-of-age story of a young woman named Catherine Morland. It is divided into two sections, Book I and Book II. The two Books differ significantly from each other in setting and, to a degree, in tone.
Book I begins when the Allens, family friends of the Morlands, offer to take Catherine with them to Bath, a resort for the wealthier members of British society. The 17-year-old Catherine eagerly accepts the Allens' invitation. Catherine is young and naïve. Her life has been relatively sheltered, so Bath is a new world for her. In Bath, Catherine is introduced to Henry Tilney, a young clergyman who impresses Catherine with his wit and pleasant conversation. Catherine quickly falls for Henry, but after their first meeting she does not see him again for some time. Mrs. Allen runs into an old acquaintance, Mrs. Thorpe, and her three young daughters, including Isabella, who is slightly older than Catherine. Catherine and Isabella are soon best friends. Isabella, superficial and fond of gossip, inducts Catherine into the social world of Bath, with all its balls, dances, shows, fashion, and its gossip.
Just when Catherine and Isabella have settled into a close friendship, they are met with the arrival of James Morland, Catherine's brother, and John Thorpe, Isabella's brother. James and John are friends at Oxford University. Isabella wastes no time in flirting with James, and soon it is obvious to everyone except Catherine that James and Isabella are in love. Taking a cue from James, John tries to woo Catherine, asking her to be his dance partner. But at a ball, Catherine sees Henry Tilney again and is more interested in Henry than in John. John's bragging and his arrogant nature put off Catherine.
Soon all of Isabella's time is taken up with James. Without Isabella to spend her time with and saddled with the unpleasant John Thorpe, Catherine decides to become friends with Eleanor Tilney, Henry's sister. Eleanor quickly sees that Catherine has feelings for Henry, but does not say anything. After rain seems to wash out her plans for a walk with Henry and Eleanor, Catherine is pressured by James and Isabella into riding with John, much to her dismay. On the way, she spots Henry and Eleanor walking toward her house for the planned walk. John refuses to stop, angering Catherine.
Catherine apologizes to Eleanor and Henry, and plans are made for another walk. John, Isabella, and James again intervene, pressuring Catherine into another outing. Catherine firmly refuses this time and joins Eleanor and Henry in a walk around Beechen Cliff. They discuss novels, and Catherine is delighted to find that Henry and Eleanor love books as much as she does. Catherine returns home to discover that James and Isabella have become engaged. She briefly meets with John, who is leaving Bath for several weeks. John leaves with the false impression that Catherine is in love with him, although Catherine does not realize this.
Book II begins with the arrival of Henry's older brother, Captain Frederick Tilney. Isabella quickly catches the eye of the captain and, dismayed by the discovery of James's modest income, begins to flirt with Frederick. Eleanor invites Catherine to visit the Tilney home in Northanger Abbey. The invitation is seconded by Eleanor's father, General Tilney. Catherine eagerly accepts the invitation, delighted at the prospect of visiting a real abbey and at seeing more of Henry. Before Catherine leaves, Isabella tells her that John is planning to propose to Catherine. Catherine tells Isabella to write him and tell him, with her apologies, that he is mistaken. Frederick appears and flirts with Isabella, who returns his attentions. Dismayed by this behavior, Catherine asks Henry to convince Frederick to leave Isabella alone. Henry refuses, knowing that Isabella is at least as guilty as the captain, but he tells Catherine that Frederick will probably leave Bath with his regiment soon anyway.
Catherine leaves with the Tilneys for Northanger Abbey. On the way, Catherine tells Henry how she imagines the Abbey to resemble the haunted ruins of the Gothic novels she loves. Henry, amused, responds by giving a hypothetical account of her first night at the Abbey, complete with mysterious chests, violent storms, and secret passages. Northanger Abbey turns out to be quite dull, having been fixed up by General Tilney. Due to her overactive imagination, Catherine entertains all sorts of frightening ideas about the place, each of which is thwarted. For instance, a strange bureau in Catherine's room turns out to contain nothing more mysterious than receipts. Catherine becomes intrigued by the death of Eleanor and Henry's mother years earlier. Her mind full of Gothic plots, Catherine suspects that General Tilney of murdering his wife. Catherine sneaks into the mother's old chamber and discovers nothing. She is caught by Henry, who guesses her thoughts and scolds her. Mortified and ashamed, Catherine quickly resumes her good behavior.
Catherine receives a letter from her brother telling her that his engagement to Isabella has been called off. Catherine thinks that Frederick forced himself between them, but Henry convinces her that it was as much Isabella's fault as Frederick's. Catherine visits Henry's house at Woodston. The General drops hints about Catherine marrying Henry. Catherine gets another letter, this time from Isabella, telling her that Frederick has left her, and asking Catherine to apologize to James for her. Angry at being manipulated, Catherine wishes she had never known Isabella. The General leaves on a business trip, and Henry goes back to Woodston for several days. The General then returns unexpectedly and tells Eleanor to send Catherine away the next morning. Though she is very embarrassed, Eleanor has no choice but to send Catherine to her home in Fullerton.
Catherine's family is irritated by the General's rudeness, but is glad to have her home. Catherine mopes around, despondent, until suddenly Henry arrives in Fullerton and proposes to her. Henry explains that his father's behavior was due to John Thorpe. In Bath, when John thought Catherine loved him, he had told General Tilney that Catherine was from a very wealthy family. When the General ran into John much later, after Isabella had told John about Catherine's true feelings, John had angrily told the General that the Morlands were almost poor. Mortified, the General had sent Catherine away, furious that his hopes for John to make a wealthy match were to be frustrated. Henry and Catherine decide to wait until the General gives his consent to their marriage. Within a few months, Eleanor marries a very wealthy and important man, which puts the General in a good mood. Once he is told of the true nature of the Morland's financial situation, which is moderate, he gives his consent, and the novel ends with the marriage of Henry and Catherine."
Termination,"A Black sharecropper's family is poor and hungry. The father and his dog, Sounder, go hunting each night, but the hunting is poor. The family subsists on biscuits and gravy until one morning they wake up to the smell of boiling ham. They eat it, but a while later a sheriff and two of his deputies burst into the cabin and arrest the father, saying that they have proof he stole the ham. Sounder runs after them, and one of the deputies shoots him.
The boy goes looking for Sounder but cannot find him anywhere. When he traces their steps, he finds blood on the ground along with Sounder's ear. He puts the ear under his pillow and wishes for Sounder's return. His mother thinks Sounder has gone off to die on his own, but for several weeks the boy goes in search of the dog each day. In father's absence, the family survives on the money mother makes by shelling walnuts. The boy undertakes the added responsibility of helping to look after his siblings, and he is stricken by the intense loneliness in the cabin.
Around Christmastime, the boy's mother makes a four-layer cake for him to bring to his father in jail. On the way there, the boy is nervous about being stopped and made fun of by the townspeople. When he arrives at the jail, the jail guard treats him rudely, making him wait to enter for a number of hours. Finally, the boy is let into the jail, and the guard breaks the cake into pieces. The boy gives it to his father anyway and tells his father that Sounder might not be dead. The conversation between the boy and his father is strained and awkward, and at the end of it his father tells him not to come back to the jail anymore.
The next morning the boy wakes up to the sound of faint whining and goes outside to find Sounder standing there. The dog can only use three of its legs and only has one ear and one eye. The boy and his mother tend to the dog, gradually getting used to the way Sounder looks. Soon they receive word that his father was convicted and sentenced to hard labor, traveling county to county. The boy resolves to search for his father, and, for a period of months, he journeys around the county looking for convicts working. One day the boy spots a group of convicts working, and he leans up against a fence to watch them, looking for his father. The guard watching the group whacks the boy on the fingers with a piece of iron and tells him to leave.
The boy runs to a school where he tries to wash the blood of off his hands. He finds an old book in a trashcan and carries it with him. While he is at the cistern, school lets out, and he eventually meets an old teacher who takes him in, dresses his wounds, and asks what has happened to him. The boy tells the teacher about Sounder and his father, and the teacher extends an offer for the boy to live with him and learn to read. The boy's mother tells him to go, and the boy stays with the teacher during the fall and winter, working in the fields during the summer. One fall the boy is at home helping with chores when they see his father walking back toward them. Half of his father's body is damaged from a dynamite blast, but the man has made it home.
The man and his dog are reunited and leave one night to go hunting. Sounder later comes back without his master, and, when the boy goes looking for his father, he finds him dead. Soon after, Sounder climbs under the porch and dies as well. Despite their deaths, there is a sense of peace and resolution over the family—especially over the boy, who has achieved the single thing he most wanted in the world, which is achieving his literacy."
Revenue,"Pip, a young orphan living with his sister and her husband in the marshes of Kent, sits in a cemetery one evening looking at his parents’ tombstones. Suddenly, an escaped convict springs up from behind a tombstone, grabs Pip, and orders him to bring him food and a file for his leg irons. Pip obeys, but the fearsome convict is soon captured anyway. The convict protects Pip by claiming to have stolen the items himself.
One day Pip is taken by his Uncle Pumblechook to play at Satis House, the home of the wealthy dowager Miss Havisham, who is extremely eccentric: she wears an old wedding dress everywhere she goes and keeps all the clocks in her house stopped at the same time. During his visit, he meets a beautiful young girl named Estella, who treats him coldly and contemptuously. Nevertheless, he falls in love with her and dreams of becoming a wealthy gentleman so that he might be worthy of her. He even hopes that Miss Havisham intends to make him a gentleman and marry him to Estella, but his hopes are dashed when, after months of regular visits to Satis House, Miss Havisham decides to help him become a common laborer in his family’s business.
With Miss Havisham’s guidance, Pip is apprenticed to his brother-in-law, Joe, who is the village blacksmith. Pip works in the forge unhappily, struggling to better his education with the help of the plain, kind Biddy and encountering Joe’s malicious day laborer, Orlick. One night, after an altercation with Orlick, Pip’s sister, known as Mrs. Joe, is viciously attacked and becomes a mute invalid. From her signals, Pip suspects that Orlick was responsible for the attack.
One day a lawyer named Jaggers appears with strange news: a secret benefactor has given Pip a large fortune, and Pip must come to London immediately to begin his education as a gentleman. Pip happily assumes that his previous hopes have come true—that Miss Havisham is his secret benefactor and that the old woman intends for him to marry Estella.
In London, Pip befriends a young gentleman named Herbert Pocket and Jaggers’s law clerk, Wemmick. He expresses disdain for his former friends and loved ones, especially Joe, but he continues to pine after Estella. He furthers his education by studying with the tutor Matthew Pocket, Herbert’s father. Herbert himself helps Pip learn how to act like a gentleman. When Pip turns twenty-one and begins to receive an income from his fortune, he will secretly help Herbert buy his way into the business he has chosen for himself. But for now, Herbert and Pip lead a fairly undisciplined life in London, enjoying themselves and running up debts. Orlick reappears in Pip’s life, employed as Miss Havisham’s porter, but is promptly fired by Jaggers after Pip reveals Orlick’s unsavory past. Mrs. Joe dies, and Pip goes home for the funeral, feeling tremendous grief and remorse. Several years go by, until one night a familiar figure barges into Pip’s room—the convict, Magwitch, who stuns Pip by announcing that he, not Miss Havisham, is the source of Pip’s fortune. He tells Pip that he was so moved by Pip’s boyhood kindness that he dedicated his life to making Pip a gentleman, and he made a fortune in Australia for that very purpose.
Pip is appalled, but he feels morally bound to help Magwitch escape London, as the convict is pursued both by the police and by Compeyson, his former partner in crime. A complicated mystery begins to fall into place when Pip discovers that Compeyson was the man who abandoned Miss Havisham at the altar and that Estella is Magwitch’s daughter. Miss Havisham has raised her to break men’s hearts, as revenge for the pain her own broken heart caused her. Pip was merely a boy for the young Estella to practice on; Miss Havisham delighted in Estella’s ability to toy with his affections.
As the weeks pass, Pip sees the good in Magwitch and begins to care for him deeply. Before Magwitch’s escape attempt, Estella marries an upper-class lout named Bentley Drummle. Pip makes a visit to Satis House, where Miss Havisham begs his forgiveness for the way she has treated him in the past, and he forgives her. Later that day, when she bends over the fireplace, her clothing catches fire and she goes up in flames. She survives but becomes an invalid. In her final days, she will continue to repent for her misdeeds and to plead for Pip’s forgiveness.
The time comes for Pip and his friends to spirit Magwitch away from London. Just before the escape attempt, Pip is called to a shadowy meeting in the marshes, where he encounters the vengeful, evil Orlick. Orlick is on the verge of killing Pip when Herbert arrives with a group of friends and saves Pip’s life. Pip and Herbert hurry back to effect Magwitch’s escape. They try to sneak Magwitch down the river on a rowboat, but they are discovered by the police, who Compeyson tipped off. Magwitch and Compeyson fight in the river, and Compeyson is drowned. Magwitch is sentenced to death, and Pip loses his fortune. Magwitch feels that his sentence is God’s forgiveness and dies at peace. Pip falls ill; Joe comes to London to care for him, and they are reconciled. Joe gives him the news from home: Orlick, after robbing Pumblechook, is now in jail; Miss Havisham has died and left most of her fortune to the Pockets; Biddy has taught Joe how to read and write. After Joe leaves, Pip decides to rush home after him and marry Biddy, but when he arrives there he discovers that she and Joe have already married.
Pip decides to go abroad with Herbert to work in the mercantile trade. Returning many years later, he encounters Estella in the ruined garden at Satis House. Drummle, her husband, treated her badly, but he is now dead. Pip finds that Estella’s coldness and cruelty have been replaced by a sad kindness, and the two leave the garden hand in hand, Pip believing that they will never part again. (Note: Dickens’s original ending to Great Expectations differed from the one described in this summary. The final Summary and Analysis section of this SparkNote provides a description of the first ending and explains why Dickens rewrote it.)"
Value,"Guy Montag is a fireman who burns books in a futuristic American city. In Montag’s world, firemen start fires rather than putting them out. The people in this society do not read books, enjoy nature, spend time by themselves, think independently, or have meaningful conversations. Instead, they drive very fast, watch excessive amounts of television on wall-size sets, and listen to the radio on “Seashell Radio” sets attached to their ears.
Montag encounters a gentle seventeen-year-old girl named Clarisse McClellan, who opens his eyes to the emptiness of his life with her innocently penetrating questions and her unusual love of people and nature. Over the next few days, Montag experiences a series of disturbing events. First, his wife, Mildred, attempts suicide by swallowing a bottle of sleeping pills. Then, when he responds to an alarm that an old woman has a stash of hidden literature, the woman shocks him by choosing to be burned alive along with her books. A few days later, he hears that Clarisse has been killed by a speeding car. Montag’s dissatisfaction with his life increases, and he begins to search for a solution in a stash of books that he has stolen from his own fires and hidden inside an air-conditioning vent.
When Montag fails to show up for work, his fire chief, Beatty, pays a visit to his house. Beatty explains that it’s normal for a fireman to go through a phase of wondering what books have to offer, and he delivers a dizzying monologue explaining how books came to be banned in the first place. According to Beatty, special-interest groups and other “minorities” objected to books that offended them. Soon, books all began to look the same, as writers tried to avoid offending anybody. This was not enough, however, and society as a whole decided to simply burn books rather than permit conflicting opinions. Beatty tells Montag to take twenty-four hours or so to see if his stolen books contain anything worthwhile and then turn them in for incineration. Montag begins a long and frenzied night of reading.
Overwhelmed by the task of reading, Montag looks to his wife for help and support, but she prefers television to her husband’s company and cannot understand why he would want to take the terrible risk of reading books. He remembers that he once met a retired English professor named Faber sitting in a park, and he decides that this man might be able to help him understand what he reads. He visits Faber, who tells him that the value of books lies in the detailed awareness of life that they contain. Faber says that Montag needs not only books but also the leisure to read them and the freedom to act upon their ideas.
Faber agrees to help Montag with his reading, and they concoct a risky scheme to overthrow the status quo. Faber will contact a printer and begin reproducing books, and Montag will plant books in the homes of firemen to discredit the profession and to destroy the machinery of censorship. Faber gives him a two-way radio earpiece (the “green bullet”) so that he can hear what Montag hears and talk to him secretly.
Montag goes home, and soon two of his wife’s friends arrive to watch television. The women discuss their families and the war that is about to be declared in an extremely frivolous manner. Their superficiality angers him, and he takes out a book of poetry and reads “Dover Beach” by Matthew Arnold. Faber buzzes in his ear for him to be quiet, and Mildred tries to explain that the poetry reading is a standard way for firemen to demonstrate the uselessness of literature. The women are extremely disturbed by the poem and leave to file a complaint against Montag.
Montag goes to the fire station and hands over one of his books to Beatty. Beatty confuses Montag by barraging him with contradictory quotations from great books. Beatty exploits these contradictions to show that literature is morbid and dangerously complex, and that it deserves incineration. Suddenly, the alarm sounds, and they rush off to answer the call, only to find that the alarm is at Montag’s own house. Mildred gets into a cab with her suitcase, and Montag realizes that his own wife has betrayed him.
Beatty forces Montag to burn the house himself; when he is done, Beatty places him under arrest. When Beatty continues to berate Montag, Montag turns the flamethrower on his superior and proceeds to burn him to ashes. Montag knocks the other firemen unconscious and runs. The Mechanical Hound, a monstrous machine that Beatty has set to attack Montag, pounces and injects Montag’s leg with a large dose of anesthetic. Montag manages to destroy it with his flamethrower; then he walks off the numbness in his leg and escapes with some books that were hidden in his backyard. He hides these in another fireman’s house and calls in an alarm from a pay phone.
Montag goes to Faber’s house, where he learns that a new Hound has been put on his trail, along with several helicopters and a television crew. Faber tells Montag that he is leaving for St. Louis to see a retired printer who may be able to help them. Montag gives Faber some money and tells him how to remove Montag’s scent from his house so the Hound will not enter it. Montag then takes some of Faber’s old clothes and runs off toward the river. The whole city watches as the chase unfolds on TV, but Montag manages to escape in the river and change into Faber’s clothes to disguise his scent. He drifts downstream into the country and follows a set of abandoned railroad tracks until he finds a group of renegade intellectuals (“the Book People”), led by a man named Granger, who welcome him. They are a part of a nationwide network of book lovers who have memorized many great works of literature and philosophy. They hope that they may be of some help to mankind in the aftermath of the war that has just been declared. Montag’s role is to memorize the Book of Ecclesiastes.

Proposed,"The full title of Swift's pamphlet is ""A Modest Proposal for Preventing the Children of Poor People from Being a Burthen to their Parents, or the Country, and for Making them Beneficial to the Publick."" The tract is an ironically conceived attempt to ""find out a fair, cheap, and easy Method"" for converting the starving children of Ireland into ""sound and useful members of the Commonwealth."" Across the country poor children, predominantly Catholics, are living in squalor because their families are too poor to keep them fed and clothed.
The author argues, by hard-edged economic reasoning as well as from a self-righteous moral stance, for a way to turn this problem into its own solution. His proposal, in effect, is to fatten up these undernourished children and feed them to Ireland's rich land-owners. Children of the poor could be sold into a meat market at the age of one, he argues, thus combating overpopulation and unemployment, sparing families the expense of child-bearing while providing them with a little extra income, improving the culinary experience of the wealthy, and contributing to the overall economic well-being of the nation.
The author offers statistical support for his assertions and gives specific data about the number of children to be sold, their weight and price, and the projected consumption patterns. He suggests some recipes for preparing this delicious new meat, and he feels sure that innovative cooks will be quick to generate more. He also anticipates that the practice of selling and eating children will have positive effects on family morality: husbands will treat their wives with more respect, and parents will value their children in ways hitherto unknown. His conclusion is that the implementation of this project will do more to solve Ireland's complex social, political, and economic problems than any other measure that has been proposed."
Recommending,"In Common Sense, Thomas Paine argues for American independence. His argument begins with more general, theoretical reflections about government and religion, then progresses onto the specifics of the colonial situation.
Paine begins by distinguishing between government and society. Society, according to Paine, is everything constructive and good that people join together to accomplish. Government, on the other hand, is an institution whose sole purpose is to protect us from our own vices. Government has its origins in the evil of man and is therefore a necessary evil at best. Paine says that government's sole purpose is to protect life, liberty and property, and that a government should be judged solely on the basis of the extent to which it accomplishes this goal.
Paine then considers an imagined scenario in which a small group of people has been placed on an island, and cut off from the rest of society. In time, these people develop ties with one another, and lawmaking becomes inevitable. Paine says the people will be much happier if they are responsible for the creation of the laws that rule them. Paine is also implicitly arguing that such a system of representation is also better for the American colonists. Having expressed his disagreement with British reign in America, Paine proceeds to launch a general attack on the British system of government. Paine says the British system is too complex and rife with contradictions, and that the monarchy is granted far too much power. The British system pretends to offer a reasonable system of checks and balances, but in fact, it does not.
From here Paine moves on to discuss, in general, the notions of monarchy and hereditary succession. Man, Pain argues, was born into a state of equality, and the distinction that has arisen between king and subject is an unnatural one. At first, Paine says, the world was without kings, but the ancient Jews decided they wanted a king. This angered God, but he allowed them to have one. Paine presents pages of biblical evidence detailing God's wrath at the idea of the Jews having a king. The conclusion Paine reaches is that the practice of monarchy originates from sin, and is an institution that the Bible and God condemn. Paine calls hereditary succession an abominable practice. He says that even if people were to choose to have a king, that does not legitimize that King's child acting as a future ruler. Furthermore, hereditary succession has brought with it innumerable evils, such as incompetent kings, corruption, and civil war.
Having dispensed with the preliminary theoretical issues, Paine sets in to discuss the details of the American situation. In response to the argument that America has flourished under British rule, and therefore ought to stay under the king, Paine says that such an argument fails to realize that America has evolved and no longer needs Britain's help. Some say that Britain has protected America, and therefore deserves allegiance, but Paine responds that Britain has only watched over America in order to secure its own economic well-being. Paine adds that most recently, instead of watching over the colonies, the British have been attacking them, and are therefore undeserving of American loyalty.
Paine says that the colonies have little to gain from remaining attached to Britain. Commerce can be better conducted with the rest of Europe, but only after America becomes independent. Paine also asserts that if the colonies remain attached to Britain, the same problems that have arisen in the past will arise in the future. Paine argues that it is necessary to seek independence now, as to do otherwise would only briefly cover up problems that will surely reemerge.
Paine even proposes the form of government that the independent colonies should adopt. His recommendation is for a representative democracy that gives roughly equal weight to each of the colonies.
Paine explains why the current time is a good time to break free of Britain. Primarily, Paine focuses on the present size of the colonies, and on their current capabilities. He presents an inventory of the British Navy and gives calculations revealing how America could build a navy of comparable size. Paine recommends this as a way of ensuring America's security and prosperity in trade. Paine also argues that America is sufficiently small as to be united now. If time were to elapse, and the population of the colonies to grow, the same feeling of unity would not be present. Paine adds that if the Americans revolt now, they can use the vast expanses of uncharted land to the West in order to pay down some of the debt they will incur.
Paine says that as a colony of Britain, America lacks respectability on the international scene. They are seen simply as rebels, and cannot form substantial alliances with other nations. In order to prosper in the long term, the colonies need to be independent. Paine says that, by declaring independence, America will be able to ask for the help of other countries in its struggle for freedom. For all of these reasons, Paine says it is imperative and urgent that the colonies declare independence."
You,"The story about the mysterious death of Lydia Lee moves back and forth in time. The story opens by announcing that sixteen-year-old Lydia—her parents’ favorite child—is dead, though her family doesn’t know it yet. The Lees live in Middlewood, Ohio. Marilyn, Lydia’s white mother, aspires to be a doctor. Her Chinese American father, James, is an American history professor. Her studious older brother Nathan is obsessed with space and headed to Harvard. And her sister Hannah, in fifth grade, is quietly observant and often overlooked. When Marilyn finds that Lydia missing, she is sure Lydia’s been kidnapped. Nathan thinks the neighbor Jack, a carefree loner who sleeps with a lot of girls, knows something about Lydia’s disappearance. The next day someone sees a rowboat in the middle of the town lake. The police drag the lake and find Lydia’s body.
The story shifts to the 1950s and provides background about Marilyn’s and James’s wishes and concerns, including how they met, married, and ended up in Middlewood. The story returns to the present with Lydia’s funeral and the Lees looking for answers. An autopsy report determines Lydia’s cause of death is drowning with no signs of foul play. James finds solace in an affair with his teaching assistant, Louisa. The story then shifts back to when Lydia was little and Marilyn hoped to resume her studies. Closing up her mother’s house after she died, Marilyn feels even more determined not to end up like her prim 1950s housewife mother. Marilyn decides to leave her family, without explanation, to finish her studies in Toledo. That summer, a young Nathan has a humiliating experience at the pool that he blames on Jack. The event reminds James of being teased as a kid, but instead of comforting Nathan, he’s hard on him, hoping Nathan will learn how to fit in.
After Lydia’s death, the Lees grieve separately. Officer Fiske indicates that Lydia may have committed suicide because she had no friends and wasn’t doing well in school. Nathan continues to believe that Jack is connected to Lydia’s death. The story then moves back to the summer Marilyn disappeared. Lost without his wife, James barely looks after Nathan and Lydia. Nathan watches a space launch on TV that ignites his passion for space. Meanwhile, Lydia promises herself she will do whatever her mother wants if only her mother will return. In Toledo, Marilyn’s aspirations are once again disrupted by pregnancy. James comes to take her home, where she decides to pour all her frustrated ambition into Lydia. Resenting the attention Lydia gets, Nathan pushes Lydia, who can’t swim, into the lake. When he rescues her, Lydia becomes especially dependent on Nathan. 
Ten years later, Lydia struggles under her parents’ expectations—her mother’s desire for her to become a doctor and her father’s emphasis on having friends and fitting in. Lydia knows she is succeeding at neither. She worries about Nathan leaving her to go to college. In her physics class, which Lydia is failing, she begins a friendship with Jack. The two drive around smoking cigarettes and talking.
The story shifts to after Lydia’s death. The police close the investigation, ruling Lydia’s death a suicide. Misunderstandings pull the family apart and create further rifts between Marilyn and James. James continues to find comfort with Louisa. Meanwhile, Nathan holds on to his suspicion of Jack. But Hannah is certain that Jack didn’t do anything bad because she realized a while ago that Jack is in love with Nathan. When James doesn’t come home, Marilyn goes in search of him at school and at Louisa’s. 
The story then returns to before Lydia’s death, when Lydia was spending time with Jack and Nathan was monitoring their activities from a distance. Nathan catches Lydia ripping up one of his letters from Harvard. When James gives Lydia a heart locket as an early birthday present, she feels happy at first but then sees the pictures inside—pictures of herself dressed up for a school dance that pressure her to be social and fit in—and she feels dejected and angry. On her sixteenth birthday, James and Louisa take Lydia to get her driver’s permit. In the car, Lydia realizes James is having an affair with Louisa. When she fails her permit test, Lydia blames it on the fact that she was upset, but the truth is that she just didn’t study. At home, Lydia hides the locket from James under her bed but pretends to be happy during her birthday celebration.
The story returns to after Lydia’s death. James comes home and confesses to his affair. Misunderstanding and hurt, Marilyn tells James to leave. Marilyn then angrily rips apart Lydia’s room and finds her old cookbook, which makes Marilyn realize that Lydia loved her, not science. This moment breaks down Marilyn’s walls, and Hannah is finally allowed to comfort her mother and receive the affection she’s craved. Meanwhile, Nathan takes off in the car and gets drunk. On his way to Toledo, James realizes how much he has misunderstood about Marilyn. He turns the car around to go home.
The story shifts back to right before Lydia’s death. Nathan goes to visit Harvard, and Lydia understands that he’s becoming a new person who will leave the family behind. To change herself, Lydia decides to lose her virginity to Jack. But Jack gently turns her down and admits to being in love with Nathan. Feeling foolish, Lydia threatens to tell Jack’s secret. Jack then stings Lydia by telling her that she doesn’t know what she wants. 
At home, Lydia tries to figure out when everything went wrong. In the middle of the night, she decides the answer is when Nathan pulled her out of the water. Wanting to start over, this time doing what she wants and not being afraid, Lydia leaves the house and goes to the lake. There, she rows out to the middle and tries to swim back to shore, even though she doesn’t know how to swim. 
The story concludes after Lydia’s death. James returns home, snuggles Hannah, and reconciles with Marilyn. Nathan sleeps after Officer Fiske delivers him home safely. The next morning at the lake, Nathan, trailed by Hannah, releases his anger and guilt about Lydia on Jack, who lets Nathan punch him. Trying to stop Nathan, Hannah pushes him into the water. Nathan wants to let himself drown but can’t. The story ends with positive references to the future and with Jack pulling Nathan from the water while Nathan keeps his eyes on Hannah’s face."
Lower,"The Bottom is a mostly Black community in Ohio, situated in the hills above the mostly white, wealthier community of Medallion. The Bottom first became a community when a master gave it to his former slave. This ""gift"" was in fact a trick: the master gave the former slave a poor stretch of hilly land, convincing the slave the land was worthwhile by claiming that because it was hilly, it was closer to heaven. The trick, though, led to the growth of a vibrant community. Now the community faces a new threat; wealthy whites have taken a liking to the land, and would like to destroy much of the town in order to build a golf course.
Shadrack, a resident of the Bottom, fought in WWI. He returns a shattered man, unable to accept the complexities of the world; he lives on the outskirts of town, attempting to create order in his life. One of his methods involves compartmentalizing his fear of death in a ritual he invents and names National Suicide Day. The town is at first wary of him and his ritual, then, over time, unthinkingly accepts him.
Meanwhile, the families of the children Nel and Sula are contrasted. Nel is the product of a family that believes deeply in social conventions; hers is a stable home, though some might characterize it as rigid. Nel is uncertain of the conventional life her mother, Helene, wants for her; these doubts are hammered home when she meets Rochelle, her grandmother and a former prostitute, the only unconventional woman in her family line. Sula's family is very different: she lives with her grandmother, Eva, and her mother, Hannah, both of whom are seen by the town as eccentric and loose. Their house also serves as a home for three informally adopted boys and a steady stream of borders.
Despite their differences, Sula and Nel become fiercely attached to each other during adolescence. However, a traumatic accident changes everything. One day, Sula playfully swings a neighborhood boy, Chicken Little, around by his hands. When she loses her grip, the boy falls into a nearby river and drowns. They never tell anyone about the accident even though they did not intend to harm the boy. The two girls begin to grow apart. One day, in an accident, Sula's mother's dress catches fire and she dies of the burns.
After high school, Nel chooses to marry and settles into the conventional role of wife and mother. Sula follows a wildly divergent path and lives a life of fierce independence and total disregard for social conventions. Shortly after Nel's wedding, Sula leaves the Bottom for a period of 10 years. She has many affairs, some with white men. However, she finds people following the same boring routines elsewhere, so she returns to the Bottom and to Nel.
Upon her return, the town regards Sula as the very personification of evil for her blatant disregard of social conventions. Their hatred in part rests upon Sula's interracial relationships, but is crystallized when Sula has an affair with Nel's husband, Jude, who subsequently abandons Nel. Ironically, the community's labeling of Sula as evil actually improves their own lives. Her presence in the community gives them the impetus to live harmoniously with one another. Nel breaks off her friendship with Sula. Just before Sula dies in 1940, they achieve a half-hearted reconciliation. With Sula's death, the harmony that had reigned in the town quickly dissolves.
In 1965, with the Bottom facing the prospect of the white golf course, Nel visits Eva in the nursing home. Eva accuses her of sharing the guilt for Chicken Little's death. Her accusation forces Nel to confront the unfairness of her judgment against Sula. Nel admits to herself that she had blamed his death entirely on Sula and set herself up as the ""good"" half of the relationship. Nel comes to realize that in the aftermath of Chicken Little's death she had too quickly clung to social convention in an effort to define herself as ""good."" Nel goes to the cemetery and mourns at Sula's grave, calling out Sula's name in sadness.
Sula is a novel about ambiguity. It questions and examines the terms ""good"" and ""evil,"" often demonstrating that the two often resemble one another. The novel addresses the confusing mysteries of human emotions and relationships, ultimately concluding that social conventions are inadequate as a foundation for living one's life. The novel tempts the reader to apply the diametrically opposed terms of ""good and evil,"" ""right and wrong"" to the characters and their actions, and yet simultaneously shows why it is necessary to resist such temptation. While exploring the ways in which people try to make meaning of lives filled with conflicts over race, gender, and simple idiosyncratic points of views, Sula resists easy answers, demonstrating the ambiguity, beauty, and terror of life, in both its triumphs and horrors."
Tax,"Nick Carraway, a young man from Minnesota, moves to New York in the summer of 1922 to learn about the bond business. He rents a house in the West Egg district of Long Island, a wealthy but unfashionable area populated by the new rich, a group who have made their fortunes too recently to have established social connections and who are prone to garish displays of wealth. Nick’s next-door neighbor in West Egg is a mysterious man named Jay Gatsby, who lives in a gigantic Gothic mansion and throws extravagant parties every Saturday night.
Nick is unlike the other inhabitants of West Egg—he was educated at Yale and has social connections in East Egg, a fashionable area of Long Island home to the established upper class. Nick drives out to East Egg one evening for dinner with his cousin, Daisy Buchanan, and her husband, Tom, an erstwhile classmate of Nick’s at Yale. Daisy and Tom introduce Nick to Jordan Baker, a beautiful, cynical young woman with whom Nick begins a romantic relationship. Nick also learns a bit about Daisy and Tom’s marriage: Jordan tells him that Tom has a lover, Myrtle Wilson, who lives in the valley of ashes, a gray industrial dumping ground between West Egg and New York City. Not long after this revelation, Nick travels to New York City with Tom and Myrtle. At a vulgar, gaudy party in the apartment that Tom keeps for the affair, Myrtle begins to taunt Tom about Daisy, and Tom responds by breaking her nose.
As the summer progresses, Nick eventually garners an invitation to one of Gatsby’s legendary parties. He encounters Jordan Baker at the party, and they meet Gatsby himself, a surprisingly young man who affects an English accent, has a remarkable smile, and calls everyone “old sport.” Gatsby asks to speak to Jordan alone, and, through Jordan, Nick later learns more about his mysterious neighbor. Gatsby tells Jordan that he knew Daisy in Louisville in 1917 and is deeply in love with her. He spends many nights staring at the green light at the end of her dock, across the bay from his mansion. Gatsby’s extravagant lifestyle and wild parties are simply an attempt to impress Daisy. Gatsby now wants Nick to arrange a reunion between himself and Daisy, but he is afraid that Daisy will refuse to see him if she knows that he still loves her. Nick invites Daisy to have tea at his house, without telling her that Gatsby will also be there. After an initially awkward reunion, Gatsby and Daisy reestablish their connection. Their love rekindled, they begin an affair.
After a short time, Tom grows increasingly suspicious of his wife’s relationship with Gatsby. At a luncheon at the Buchanans’ house, Gatsby stares at Daisy with such undisguised passion that Tom realizes Gatsby is in love with her. Though Tom is himself involved in an extramarital affair, he is deeply outraged by the thought that his wife could be unfaithful to him. He forces the group to drive into New York City, where he confronts Gatsby in a suite at the Plaza Hotel. Tom asserts that he and Daisy have a history that Gatsby could never understand, and he announces to his wife that Gatsby is a criminal—his fortune comes from bootlegging alcohol and other illegal activities. Daisy realizes that her allegiance is to Tom, and Tom contemptuously sends her back to East Egg with Gatsby, attempting to prove that Gatsby cannot hurt him.
When Nick, Jordan, and Tom drive through the valley of ashes, however, they discover that Gatsby’s car has struck and killed Myrtle, Tom’s lover. They rush back to Long Island, where Nick learns from Gatsby that Daisy was driving the car when it struck Myrtle, but that Gatsby intends to take the blame. The next day, Tom tells Myrtle’s husband, George, that Gatsby was the driver of the car. George, who has leapt to the conclusion that the driver of the car that killed Myrtle must have been her lover, finds Gatsby in the pool at his mansion and shoots him dead. He then fatally shoots himself.
Nick stages a small funeral for Gatsby, ends his relationship with Jordan, and moves back to the Midwest to escape the disgust he feels for the people surrounding Gatsby’s life and for the emptiness and moral decay of life among the wealthy on the East Coast. Nick reflects that just as Gatsby’s dream of Daisy was corrupted by money and dishonesty, the American dream of happiness and individualism has disintegrated into the mere pursuit of wealth. Though Gatsby’s power to transform his dreams into reality is what makes him “great,” Nick reflects that the era of dreaming—both Gatsby’s dream and the American dream—is over."
Effects,"In this book, originally published in 1903, W. E. B. Du Bois has collected fourteen of his own essays about life after the Civil War, especially in the South. While the book predominantly deals with Black society and the life of “freedmen,” it also discusses how white society evolved after Emancipation. Throughout the text, Du Bois presents specific examples of racial injustice and inequality in the South. Before each essay, Du Bois includes a poem (or an excerpt from a poem or song) appropriate to the essay’s subject matter. Every inclusion is “a bar of the Sorrow Songs,—some echo of haunting melody from the only American music which welled up from the black souls in the dark past.” Du Bois revisits the significance of these inclusions at the end of the book.
While each essay examines a particular piece of the evolution of Black society, they are arranged to give the reader a historical perspective. Chapter I and Chapter II deal with the history and immediate impact of Emancipation, using historical examples and Du Bois’s own experience. Chapter III. specifically discusses the formation and responsibility of Black leadership, while criticizing Booker T. Washington on an academic level. Du Bois goes on to describe the Atlanta Compromise and the limitations it has placed on Black society in the South. Chapter IV through Chapter VII discuss the need for progress, and how it is blocked by lack of education and opportunity. He stresses that current systems produce mostly laborers, and that there is little room for Black upward mobility, especially in the South, due to a lack of education (and college-educated individuals). In Chapter VIII and Chapter IX, Du Bois describes visiting Dougherty County in rural Georgia. His first-hand experiences there are contrasted with his upbringing in New England, to show not only that there is greater disparity in the South, but also that many Black people in the South are not fully aware of it. In Chapter VI and Chapter VII, Du Bois draws on analogies to mythology to better explain the challenges he sees in the upbringing of Black men. In Chapter X., Du Bois examines the religion of the Black South. 
Chapters XI, XII, and XIII offer narrative examples of individuals Du Bois has encountered and events from Du Bois’s own life to illustrate the disparity between white and Black society. He discusses the death of his young son, pays tribute to a world-traveling preacher who remained undiscouraged, and recalls a student who had great potential but was a victim of his circumstances. Du Bois admits that these men are not well-known to history, but he considers their experiences are worthy of study. The final chapter, Chapter XIV, has several selections of “Sorrow Songs” that Du Bois describes as the “spiritual heritage of the nation.” He describes how the songs have been handed down, many from before slavery, and how they have become interconnected with religion and are still a centerpiece in Black society. 
Throughout the work, Du Bois uses historical fact and narrative example to establish how slavery and its aftereffects have shaped both Black and white society in the South. As a teacher, he then examines each situation academically. He presents cause and effect relationships and applies sociological analysis to them. The largest problem Du Bois discusses is the shortage of resources and opportunity for Black people at the beginning of the 20th century. He points out the effects of disparities in education and privilege and demonstrates the need for change."
1886,"On their weekly walk, an eminently sensible, trustworthy lawyer named Mr. Utterson listens as his friend Enfield tells a gruesome tale of assault. The tale describes a sinister figure named Mr. Hyde who tramples a young girl, disappears into a door on the street, and reemerges to pay off her relatives with a check signed by a respectable gentleman. Since both Utterson and Enfield disapprove of gossip, they agree to speak no further of the matter. It happens, however, that one of Utterson’s clients and close friends, Dr. Jekyll, has written a will transferring all of his property to this same Mr. Hyde. Soon, Utterson begins having dreams in which a faceless figure stalks through a nightmarish version of London.
Puzzled, the lawyer visits Jekyll and their mutual friend Dr. Lanyon to try to learn more. Lanyon reports that he no longer sees much of Jekyll, since they had a dispute over the course of Jekyll’s research, which Lanyon calls “unscientific balderdash.” Curious, Utterson stakes out a building that Hyde visits—which, it turns out, is a laboratory attached to the back of Jekyll’s home. Encountering Hyde, Utterson is amazed by how undefinably ugly the man seems, as if deformed, though Utterson cannot say exactly how. Much to Utterson’s surprise, Hyde willingly offers Utterson his address. Jekyll tells Utterson not to concern himself with the matter of Hyde.
A year passes uneventfully. Then, one night, a servant girl witnesses Hyde brutally beat to death an old man named Sir Danvers Carew, a member of Parliament and a client of Utterson. The police contact Utterson, and Utterson suspects Hyde as the murderer. He leads the officers to Hyde’s apartment, feeling a sense of foreboding amid the eerie weather—the morning is dark and wreathed in fog. When they arrive at the apartment, the murderer has vanished, and police searches prove futile. Shortly thereafter, Utterson again visits Jekyll, who now claims to have ended all relations with Hyde; he shows Utterson a note, allegedly written to Jekyll by Hyde, apologizing for the trouble he has caused him and saying goodbye. That night, however, Utterson’s clerk points out that Hyde’s handwriting bears a remarkable similarity to Jekyll’s own.
For a few months, Jekyll acts especially friendly and sociable, as if a weight has been lifted from his shoulders. But then Jekyll suddenly begins to refuse visitors, and Lanyon dies from some kind of shock he received in connection with Jekyll. Before dying, however, Lanyon gives Utterson a letter, with instructions that he not open it until after Jekyll’s death. Meanwhile, Utterson goes out walking with Enfield, and they see Jekyll at a window of his laboratory; the three men begin to converse, but a look of horror comes over Jekyll’s face, and he slams the window and disappears. Soon afterward, Jekyll’s butler, Mr. Poole, visits Utterson in a state of desperation: Jekyll has secluded himself in his laboratory for several weeks, and now the voice that comes from the room sounds nothing like the doctor’s. Utterson and Poole travel to Jekyll’s house through empty, windswept, sinister streets; once there, they find the servants huddled together in fear. After arguing for a time, the two of them resolve to break into Jekyll’s laboratory. Inside, they find the body of Hyde, wearing Jekyll’s clothes and apparently dead by suicide—and a letter from Jekyll to Utterson promising to explain everything.
Utterson takes the document home, where first he reads Lanyon’s letter; it reveals that Lanyon’s deterioration and eventual death were caused by the shock of seeing Mr. Hyde take a potion and metamorphose into Dr. Jekyll. The second letter constitutes a testament by Jekyll. It explains how Jekyll, seeking to separate his good side from his darker impulses, discovered a way to transform himself periodically into a deformed monster free of conscience—Mr. Hyde. At first, Jekyll reports, he delighted in becoming Hyde and rejoiced in the moral freedom that the creature possessed. Eventually, however, he found that he was turning into Hyde involuntarily in his sleep, even without taking the potion. At this point, Jekyll resolved to cease becoming Hyde. One night, however, the urge gripped him too strongly, and after the transformation he immediately rushed out and violently killed Sir Danvers Carew. Horrified, Jekyll tried more adamantly to stop the transformations, and for a time he proved successful; one day, however, while sitting in a park, he suddenly turned into Hyde, the first time that an involuntary metamorphosis had happened while he was awake.
The letter continues describing Jekyll’s cry for help. Far from his laboratory and hunted by the police as a murderer, Hyde needed Lanyon’s help to get his potions and become Jekyll again—but when he undertook the transformation in Lanyon’s presence, the shock of the sight instigated Lanyon’s deterioration and death. Meanwhile, Jekyll returned to his home, only to find himself ever more helpless and trapped as the transformations increased in frequency and necessitated even larger doses of potion in order to reverse themselves. It was the onset of one of these spontaneous metamorphoses that caused Jekyll to slam his laboratory window shut in the middle of his conversation with Enfield and Utterson. Eventually, the potion began to run out, and Jekyll was unable to find a key ingredient to make more. His ability to change back from Hyde into Jekyll slowly vanished. Jekyll writes that even as he composes his letter he knows that he will soon become Hyde permanently, and he wonders if Hyde will face execution for his crimes or choose to kill himself. Jekyll notes that, in any case, the end of his letter marks the end of the life of Dr. Jekyll. With these words, both the document and the novel come to a close."
Criminals,"Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov, a former student, lives in a tiny garret on the top floor of a run-down apartment building in St. Petersburg. He is sickly, dressed in rags, short on money, and talks to himself, but he is also handsome, proud, and intelligent. He is contemplating committing an awful crime, but the nature of the crime is not yet clear. He goes to the apartment of an old pawnbroker, Alyona Ivanovna, to get money for a watch and to plan the crime. Afterward, he stops for a drink at a tavern, where he meets a man named Marmeladov, who, in a fit of drunkenness, has abandoned his job and proceeded on a five-day drinking binge, afraid to return home to his family. Marmeladov tells Raskolnikov about his sickly wife, Katerina Ivanovna, and his daughter, Sonya, who has been forced into prostitution to support the family. Raskolnikov walks with Marmeladov to Marmeladov’s apartment, where he meets Katerina and sees firsthand the squalid conditions in which they live.
The next day, Raskolnikov receives a letter from his mother, Pulcheria Alexandrovna, informing him that his sister, Dunya, is engaged to be married to a government official named Luzhin and that they are all moving to St. Petersburg. He goes to another tavern, where he overhears a student talking about how society would be better off if the old pawnbroker Alyona Ivanovna were dead. Later, in the streets, Raskolnikov hears that the pawnbroker will be alone in her apartment the next evening. He sleeps fitfully and wakes up the next day, finds an ax, and fashions a fake item to pawn to distract the pawnbroker. That night, he goes to her apartment and kills her. While he is rummaging through her bedroom, looking for money, her sister, Lizaveta, walks in, and Raskolnikov kills her as well. He barely escapes from the apartment without being seen, then returns to his apartment and collapses on the sofa.
Waking up the next day, Raskolnikov frantically searches his clothing for traces of blood. He receives a summons from the police, but it seems to be unrelated to the murders. At the police station, he learns that his landlady is trying to collect money that he owes her. During a conversation about the murders, Raskolnikov faints, and the police begin to suspect him. Raskolnikov returns to his room, collects the goods that he stole from the pawnbroker, and buries them under a rock in an out-of-the-way courtyard. He visits his friend Razumikhin and refuses his offer of work. Returning to his apartment, Raskolnikov falls into a fitful, nightmare-ridden sleep. After four days of fever and delirium, he wakes up to find out that his housekeeper, Nastasya, and Razumikhin have been taking care of him. He learns that Zossimov, a doctor, and Zamyotov, a young police detective, have also been visiting him. They have all noticed that Raskolnikov becomes extremely uncomfortable whenever the murders of the pawnbroker and her sister are mentioned. Luzhin, Dunya’s fiancé, also makes a visit. After a confrontation with Luzhin, Raskolnikov goes to a café, where he almost confesses to Zamyotov that he is the murderer. Afterward, he impulsively goes to the apartment of the pawnbroker. On his way back home, he discovers that Marmeladov has been run over by a carriage. Raskolnikov helps to carry him back to his apartment, where Marmeladov dies. At the apartment, he meets Sonya and gives the family twenty rubles that he received from his mother. Returning with Razumikhin to his own apartment, Raskolnikov faints when he discovers that his sister and mother are there waiting for him.
Raskolnikov becomes annoyed with Pulcheria Alexandrovna and Dunya and orders them out of the room. He also commands Dunya to break her engagement with Luzhin. Razumikhin, meanwhile, falls in love with Dunya. The next morning, Razumikhin tries to explain Raskolnikov’s character to Dunya and Pulcheria Alexandrovna, and then the three return to Raskolnikov’s apartment. There, Zossimov greets them and tells them that Raskolnikov’s condition is much improved. Raskolnikov apologizes for his behavior the night before and confesses to giving all his money to the Marmeladovs. But he soon grows angry and irritable again and demands that Dunya not marry Luzhin. Dunya tells him that she is meeting with Luzhin that evening, and that although Luzhin has requested specifically that Raskolnikov not be there, she would like him to come nevertheless. Raskolnikov agrees. At that moment, Sonya enters the room, greatly embarrassed to be in the presence of Raskolnikov’s family. She invites Raskolnikov to her father’s funeral, and he accepts. On her way back to her apartment, Sonya is followed by a strange man, who we later learn is Svidrigailov—Dunya’s lecherous former employer who is obsessively attracted to her.
Under the pretense of trying to recover a watch he pawned, Raskolnikov visits the magistrate in charge of the murder investigation, Porfiry Petrovich, a relative of Razumikhin’s. Zamyotov is at the detective’s house when Raskolnikov arrives. Raskolnikov and Porfiry have a tense conversation about the murders. Raskolnikov starts to believe that Porfiry suspects him and is trying to lead him into a trap. Afterward, Raskolnikov and Razumikhin discuss the conversation, trying to figure out if Porfiry suspects him. When Raskolnikov returns to his apartment, he learns that a man had come there looking for him. When he catches up to the man in the street, the man calls him a murderer. That night Raskolnikov dreams about the pawnbroker’s murder. When he wakes up, there is a stranger in the room.
The stranger is Svidrigailov. He explains that he would like Dunya to break her engagement with Luzhin, whom he esteems unworthy of her. He offers to give Dunya the enormous sum of ten thousand rubles. He also tells Raskolnikov that his late wife, Marfa Petrovna, left Dunya three thousand rubles in her will. Raskolnikov rejects Svidrigailov’s offer of money and, after hearing him talk about seeing the ghost of Marfa, suspects that he is insane. After Svidrigailov leaves, Raskolnikov and Razumikhin walk to a restaurant to meet Dunya, Pulcheria Alexandrovna, and Luzhin. Razumikhin tells Raskolnikov that he is certain that the police suspect Raskolnikov. Luzhin is insulted to find that Raskolnikov, contrary to his wishes, is in attendance at the meal. They discuss Svidrigailov’s arrival in the city and the money that has been offered to Dunya. Luzhin and Raskolnikov get into an argument, during the course of which Luzhin offends everyone in the room, including his fiancée and prospective mother-in-law. Dunya breaks the engagement and forces him to leave. Everyone is overjoyed at his departure. Razumikhin starts to talk about plans to go into the publishing business as a family, but Raskolnikov ruins the mood by telling them that he does not want to see them anymore. When Raskolnikov leaves the room, Razumikhin chases him down the stairs. They stop, face-to-face, and Razumikhin realizes, without a word being spoken, that Raskolnikov is guilty of the murders. He rushes back to Dunya and Pulcheria Alexandrovna to reassure them that he will help them through whatever difficulties they encounter.
Raskolnikov goes to the apartment of Sonya Marmeladov. During their conversation, he learns that Sonya was a friend of one of his victims, Lizaveta. He forces Sonya to read to him the biblical story of Lazarus, who was resurrected by Jesus. Meanwhile, Svidrigailov eavesdrops from the apartment next door.
The following morning, Raskolnikov visits Porfiry Petrovich at the police department, supposedly in order to turn in a formal request for his pawned watch. As they converse, Raskolnikov starts to feel again that Porfiry is trying to lead him into a trap. Eventually, he breaks under the pressure and accuses Porfiry of playing psychological games with him. At the height of tension between them, Nikolai, a workman who is being held under suspicion for the murders, bursts into the room and confesses to the murders. On the way to Katerina Ivanovna’s memorial dinner for Marmeladov, Raskolnikov meets the mysterious man who called him a murderer and learns that the man actually knows very little about the case.
The scene shifts to the apartment of Luzhin and his roommate, Lebezyatnikov, where Luzhin is nursing his hatred for Raskolnikov, whom he blames for the breaking of his engagement to Dunya. Although Luzhin has been invited to Marmeladov’s memorial dinner, he refuses to go. He invites Sonya to his room and gives her a ten-ruble bill. Katerina’s memorial dinner goes poorly. The widow is extremely fussy and proud, but few guests have shown up, and, except for Raskolnikov, those that have are drunk and crude. Luzhin then enters the room and accuses Sonya of stealing a one-hundred-ruble bill. Sonya denies his claim, but the bill is discovered in one of her pockets. Just as everyone is about to label Sonya a thief, however, Lebezyatnikov enters and tells the room that he saw Luzhin slip the bill into Sonya’s pocket as she was leaving his room. Raskolnikov explains that Luzhin was probably trying to embarrass him by discrediting Sonya. Luzhin leaves, and a fight breaks out between Katerina and her landlady.
After the dinner, Raskolnikov goes to Sonya’s room and confesses the murders to her. They have a long conversation about his confused motives. Sonya tries to convince him to confess to the authorities. Lebezyatnikov then enters and informs them that Katerina Ivanovna seems to have gone mad—she is parading the children in the streets, begging for money. Sonya rushes out to find them while Raskolnikov goes back to his room and talks to Dunya. He soon returns to the street and sees Katerina dancing and singing wildly. She collapses after a confrontation with a policeman and, soon after being brought back to her room, dies. Svidrigailov appears and offers to pay for the funeral and the care of the children. He reveals to Raskolnikov that he knows Raskolnikov is the murderer.
Raskolnikov wanders around in a haze after his confession to Sonya and the death of Katerina. Razumikhin confronts him in his room, asking him whether he has gone mad and telling him of the pain that he has caused his mother and sister. After their conversation, Porfiry Petrovich appears and apologizes for his treatment of Raskolnikov in the police station. Nonetheless, he does not believe Nikolai’s confession. He accuses Raskolnikov of the murders but admits that he does not have enough evidence to arrest him. Finally, he urges him to confess, telling him that he will receive a lighter sentence if he does so. Raskolnikov goes looking for Svidrigailov, eventually finding him in a café. Svidrigailov tells him that though he is still attracted to Dunya, he has gotten engaged to a sixteen-year-old girl. Svidrigailov parts from Raskolnikov and manages to bring Dunya to his room, where he threatens to rape her after she refuses to marry him. She fires several shots at him with a revolver and misses, but when he sees how strongly she dislikes him, he allows her to leave. He takes her revolver and wanders aimlessly around St. Petersburg. He gives three thousand rubles to Dunya, fifteen thousand rubles to the family of his fiancée, and then books a room in a hotel. He sleeps fitfully and dreams of a flood and a seductive five-year-old girl. In the morning, he kills himself.
Raskolnikov, who is visiting his mother, tells her that he will always love her and then returns to his room, where he tells Dunya that he is planning to confess. After she leaves, he goes to visit Sonya, who gives him a cross to wear. On the way to the police station, he stops in a marketplace and kisses the ground. He almost pulls back from confessing when he reaches the police station and learns of Svidrigailov’s suicide. The sight of Sonya, however, convinces him to go through with it, and he confesses to one of the police officials, Ilya Petrovich.
A year and a half later, Raskolnikov is in prison in Siberia, where he has been for nine months. Sonya has moved to the town outside the prison, and she visits Raskolnikov regularly and tries to ease his burden. Because of his confession, his mental confusion surrounding the murders, and testimony about his past good deeds, he has received, instead of a death sentence, a reduced sentence of eight years of hard labor in Siberia. After Raskolnikov’s arrest, his mother became delirious and died. Razumikhin and Dunya were married. For a short while, Raskolnikov remains as proud and alienated from humanity as he was before his confession, but he eventually realizes that he truly loves Sonya and expresses remorse for his crime."
Dignifies,"Blanche DuBois, a schoolteacher from Laurel, Mississippi, arrives at the New Orleans apartment of her sister, Stella Kowalski. Despite the fact that Blanche seems to have fallen out of close contact with Stella, she intends to stay at Stella’s apartment for an unspecified but likely lengthy period of time, given the large trunk she has with her. Blanche tells Stella that she lost Belle Reve, their ancestral home, following the death of all their remaining relatives. She also mentions that she has been given a leave of absence from her teaching position because of her bad nerves.
Though Blanche does not seem to have enough money to afford a hotel, she is disdainful of the cramped quarters of the Kowalskis’ two-room apartment and of the apartment’s location in a noisy, diverse, working-class neighborhood. Blanche’s social condescension wins her the instant dislike of Stella’s husband, an auto-parts supply man of Polish descent named Stanley Kowalski. It is clear that Stella was happy to leave behind her the social pretensions of her background in exchange for the sexual gratification she gets from her husband; she even is pregnant with his baby. Stanley immediately distrusts Blanche to the extent that he suspects her of having cheated Stella out of her share of the family inheritance. In the process of defending herself to Stanley, Blanche reveals that Belle Reve was lost due to a foreclosed mortgage, a disclosure that signifies the dire nature of Blanche’s financial circumstances. Blanche’s heavy drinking, which she attempts to conceal from her sister and brother-in-law, is another sign that all is not well with Blanche.
The unhappiness that accompanies the animal magnetism of Stella and Stanley’s marriage reveals itself when Stanley hosts a drunken poker game with his male friends at the apartment. Blanche gets under Stanley’s skin, especially when she starts to win the affections of his close friend Mitch. After Mitch has been absent for a while, speaking with Blanche in the bedroom, Stanley erupts, storms into the bedroom, and throws the radio out of the window. When Stella yells at Stanley and defends Blanche, Stanley beats her. The men pull him off, the poker game breaks up, and Blanche and Stella escape to their upstairs neighbor Eunice’s apartment. A short while later, Stanley is remorseful and cries up to Stella to forgive him. To Blanche’s alarm, Stella returns to Stanley and embraces him passionately. Mitch meets Blanche outside of the Kowalski flat and comforts her in her distress.
The next day, Blanche tries to convince Stella to leave Stanley for a better man whose social status equals Stella’s. Blanche suggests that she and Stella contact a millionaire named Shep Huntleigh for help escaping from New Orleans; when Stella laughs at her, Blanche reveals that she is completely broke. Stanley walks in as Blanche is making fun of him and secretly overhears Blanche and Stella’s conversation. Later, he threatens Blanche with hints that he has heard rumors of her disreputable past. She is visibly dismayed.
While Blanche is alone in the apartment one evening, waiting for Mitch to pick her up for a date, a teenage boy comes by to collect money for the newspaper. Blanche doesn’t have any money for him, but she hits on him and gives him a lustful kiss. Soon after the boy departs, Mitch arrives, and they go on their date. When Blanche returns, she is exhausted and clearly has been uneasy for the entire night about the rumors Stanley mentioned earlier. In a surprisingly sincere heart-to-heart discussion with Mitch, Blanche reveals the greatest tragedy of her past. Years ago, her young husband committed suicide after she discovered and chastised him for his homosexuality. Mitch describes his own loss of a former love, and he tells Blanche that they need each other.
When the next scene begins, about one month has passed. It is the afternoon of Blanche’s birthday. Stella is preparing a dinner for Blanche, Mitch, Stanley, and herself, when Stanley comes in to tell her that he has learned news of Blanche’s sordid past. He says that after losing the DuBois mansion, Blanche moved into a fleabag motel from which she was eventually evicted because of her numerous sexual liaisons. Also, she was fired from her job as a schoolteacher because the principal discovered that she was having an affair with a teenage student. Stella is horrified to learn that Stanley has told Mitch these stories about Blanche.
The birthday dinner comes and goes, but Mitch never arrives. Stanley indicates to Blanche that he is aware of her past. For a birthday present, he gives her a one-way bus ticket back to Laurel. Stanley’s cruelty so disturbs Stella that it appears the Kowalski household is about to break up, but the onset of Stella’s labor prevents the imminent fight.
Several hours later, Blanche, drunk, sits alone in the apartment. Mitch, also drunk, arrives and repeats all he’s learned from Stanley. Eventually Blanche confesses that the stories are true, but she also reveals the need for human affection she felt after her husband’s death. Mitch tells Blanche that he can never marry her, saying she isn’t fit to live in the same house as his mother. Having learned that Blanche is not the chaste lady she pretended to be, Mitch tries to have sex with Blanche, but she forces him to leave by yelling “Fire!” to attract the attention of passersby outside.
Later, Stanley returns from the hospital to find Blanche even more drunk. She tells him that she will soon be leaving New Orleans with her former suitor Shep Huntleigh, who is now a millionaire. Stanley knows that Blanche’s story is entirely in her imagination, but he is so happy about his baby that he proposes they each celebrate their good fortune. Blanche spurns Stanley, and things grow contentious. When she tries to step past him, he refuses to move out of her way. Blanche becomes terrified to the point that she smashes a bottle on the table and threatens to smash Stanley in the face. Stanley grabs her arm and says that it’s time for the “date” they’ve had set up since Blanche’s arrival. Blanche resists, but Stanley uses his physical strength to overcome her, and he carries her to bed. The pulsing music indicates that Stanley rapes Blanche.
The next scene takes place weeks later, as Stella and her neighbor Eunice pack Blanche’s bags. Blanche is in the bath, and Stanley plays poker with his buddies in the front room. A doctor will arrive soon to take Blanche to an insane asylum, but Blanche believes she is leaving to join her millionaire. Stella confesses to Eunice that she simply cannot allow herself to believe Blanche’s assertion that Stanley raped her. When Blanche emerges from the bathroom, her deluded talk makes it clear that she has lost her grip on reality.
The doctor arrives with a nurse, and Blanche initially panics and struggles against them when they try to take her away. Stanley and his friends fight to subdue Blanche, while Eunice holds Stella back to keep her from interfering. Mitch begins to cry. Finally, the doctor approaches Blanche in a gentle manner and convinces her to leave with him. She allows him to lead her away and does not look back or say goodbye as she goes. Stella sobs with her child in her arms, and Stanley comforts her with loving words and caresses."
Gigantic,"Nick Carraway, a young man from Minnesota, moves to New York in the summer of 1922 to learn about the bond business. He rents a house in the West Egg district of Long Island, a wealthy but unfashionable area populated by the new rich, a group who have made their fortunes too recently to have established social connections and who are prone to garish displays of wealth. Nick’s next-door neighbor in West Egg is a mysterious man named Jay Gatsby, who lives in a gigantic Gothic mansion and throws extravagant parties every Saturday night.
Nick is unlike the other inhabitants of West Egg—he was educated at Yale and has social connections in East Egg, a fashionable area of Long Island home to the established upper class. Nick drives out to East Egg one evening for dinner with his cousin, Daisy Buchanan, and her husband, Tom, an erstwhile classmate of Nick’s at Yale. Daisy and Tom introduce Nick to Jordan Baker, a beautiful, cynical young woman with whom Nick begins a romantic relationship. Nick also learns a bit about Daisy and Tom’s marriage: Jordan tells him that Tom has a lover, Myrtle Wilson, who lives in the valley of ashes, a gray industrial dumping ground between West Egg and New York City. Not long after this revelation, Nick travels to New York City with Tom and Myrtle. At a vulgar, gaudy party in the apartment that Tom keeps for the affair, Myrtle begins to taunt Tom about Daisy, and Tom responds by breaking her nose.
As the summer progresses, Nick eventually garners an invitation to one of Gatsby’s legendary parties. He encounters Jordan Baker at the party, and they meet Gatsby himself, a surprisingly young man who affects an English accent, has a remarkable smile, and calls everyone “old sport.” Gatsby asks to speak to Jordan alone, and, through Jordan, Nick later learns more about his mysterious neighbor. Gatsby tells Jordan that he knew Daisy in Louisville in 1917 and is deeply in love with her. He spends many nights staring at the green light at the end of her dock, across the bay from his mansion. Gatsby’s extravagant lifestyle and wild parties are simply an attempt to impress Daisy. Gatsby now wants Nick to arrange a reunion between himself and Daisy, but he is afraid that Daisy will refuse to see him if she knows that he still loves her. Nick invites Daisy to have tea at his house, without telling her that Gatsby will also be there. After an initially awkward reunion, Gatsby and Daisy reestablish their connection. Their love rekindled, they begin an affair.
After a short time, Tom grows increasingly suspicious of his wife’s relationship with Gatsby. At a luncheon at the Buchanans’ house, Gatsby stares at Daisy with such undisguised passion that Tom realizes Gatsby is in love with her. Though Tom is himself involved in an extramarital affair, he is deeply outraged by the thought that his wife could be unfaithful to him. He forces the group to drive into New York City, where he confronts Gatsby in a suite at the Plaza Hotel. Tom asserts that he and Daisy have a history that Gatsby could never understand, and he announces to his wife that Gatsby is a criminal—his fortune comes from bootlegging alcohol and other illegal activities. Daisy realizes that her allegiance is to Tom, and Tom contemptuously sends her back to East Egg with Gatsby, attempting to prove that Gatsby cannot hurt him.
When Nick, Jordan, and Tom drive through the valley of ashes, however, they discover that Gatsby’s car has struck and killed Myrtle, Tom’s lover. They rush back to Long Island, where Nick learns from Gatsby that Daisy was driving the car when it struck Myrtle, but that Gatsby intends to take the blame. The next day, Tom tells Myrtle’s husband, George, that Gatsby was the driver of the car. George, who has leapt to the conclusion that the driver of the car that killed Myrtle must have been her lover, finds Gatsby in the pool at his mansion and shoots him dead. He then fatally shoots himself.
Nick stages a small funeral for Gatsby, ends his relationship with Jordan, and moves back to the Midwest to escape the disgust he feels for the people surrounding Gatsby’s life and for the emptiness and moral decay of life among the wealthy on the East Coast. Nick reflects that just as Gatsby’s dream of Daisy was corrupted by money and dishonesty, the American dream of happiness and individualism has disintegrated into the mere pursuit of wealth. Though Gatsby’s power to transform his dreams into reality is what makes him “great,” Nick reflects that the era of dreaming—both Gatsby’s dream and the American dream—is over."
Having,"Having Our Say is an oral history conducted by Amy Hill Hearth with the centenarian sisters Sadie and Bessie Delany. The book is divided into a preface and seven parts. In the preface, Hearth describes how the Delanys first charm her when she writes about them for the New York Times and how she eventually convinces them to share their stories in a book. After the preface, Hearth disappears from the narrative. She provides context for the Delanys’ stories at the beginning of each section but otherwise acts strictly as a listener. When the sisters tell a story together, or in an almost identical fashion, Hearth attributes the chapters to them both. When the sisters have distinctive viewpoints or ways of telling a story, Hearth attributes the chapter to either Bessie or Sadie. Though the book’s seven parts generally follow a chronological pattern, the sisters occasionally discuss the present day (the early 1990s). They compare different eras of history; make judgments with their century of experience; and frequently discuss racism, sexism, and aging.
Throughout the stories, the sisters talk about their childhoods in the segregated South, where the “rebby boys,” or racist white men, are a constant menace. The sisters have very different personalities. Sadie is an obedient mama’s child, and Bessie is strong-willed and outspoken. Both sisters are determined and intelligent. The sisters describe their parents, Henry Beard Delany and Nanny James Logan, who grew up during and after the Civil War. Following the “Surrender” came the difficult days of the Reconstruction, when poverty and a struggle for power ruled the South. Henry was born into slavery. When the Surrender came, his family began a free life with nothing. The Delanys were luckier than most Black families because they were together and they could read. Nanny’s family faced discrimination because her father was white and her mother was a quarter Black. Though Nanny appeared white, she was considered “colored,” and her own parents couldn’t marry. Nanny and Henry met at Saint Augustine’s School in Raleigh, North Carolina, and Henry eventually became vice principal of “Saint Aug’s.” The Delany parents had ten children, including Sadie and Bessie.
Sadie and Bessie encounter racism early in life. The Jim Crow laws throughout the South required separate facilities for whites and Black people, and on the trolley to Pullen Park, a driver tells the Delany family to sit in the back. The spring where they drink water at the park is divided, with one side for white people and the other for Black people, and the drugstore where they used to buy limeade will no longer serve them. Despite all the obstacles, all the Delany children plan to go to college. To pay for school, both Sadie and Bessie take jobs as teachers. Sadie is a Jeanes Supervisor, setting up domestic science programs in rural schools, and she takes Booker T. Washington on tours of her school district. Bessie teaches first in rural North Carolina, then in Georgia. In Georgia, she is nearly lynched on her way to her new job when she stands up to a drunken white man in a train station waiting room. Both women date, but their father is critical of their boyfriends, and Nanny tells Bessie that she will have to choose between work and a family.
Sadie moves to Harlem in 1916, and Bessie follows nearly two years later. All the Delany children except Lemuel eventually migrate to Harlem. The Harlem Renaissance, a time of literary experimentation and cutting-edge jazz music, is in full swing. Although they sometimes go to nightclubs and know many famous personalities through their brother Hubert, a New York City political figure, the sisters focus on their careers. Sadie attends Pratt Institute, then Columbia University, where she receives a master’s degree. She becomes the first Black woman to teach domestic science at public high schools in New York City. Bessie studies dentistry at Columbia University and opens a practice in Harlem. She shares an office with her brother Hap, and the place becomes a meeting point for thinkers such as E. Franklin Frazier. Bessie narrowly avoids an encounter with the Ku Klux Klan on Long Island and becomes an outspoken protestor against racial discrimination. The family is devastated when Henry Beard Delany dies in 1928. Nanny moves to Harlem and begins to go on trips with Sadie. The Black community is particularly hard-hit by the Depression, but the Delanys cope.
During World War II, the Delany sisters are concerned with their nephew, Little Hubie. Little Hubie is born “damaged” (which is the extent of the explanation the sisters give for his condition) and dies when he is ten years old. Manross Delany fights in the war and faces discrimination in the U.S. armed forces. Sadie, Bessie, and their mother move to a cottage in the Bronx and enjoy cultivating their own garden. Nanny is too elderly to stay home by herself, so Bessie retires at fifty-nine to take care of her. Before she dies, Nanny meets Eleanor Roosevelt. Around this time, the civil rights movement is underway, and the Jim Crow laws at last begin to unravel. The deaths of their mother and a number of their brothers grieve the sisters. They decide to move to Mount Vernon, a mostly white suburb in New York. At their advanced age, the Delany sisters are part of a quiet revolutionary movement to integrate white suburbs. Sadie and Bessie discuss aging and the fears and fearlessness that accompany that process."
Gallant,"During a New Year’s Eve feast at King Arthur’s court, a strange figure, referred to only as the Green Knight, pays the court an unexpected visit. He challenges the group’s leader or any other brave representative to a game. The Green Knight says that he will allow whomever accepts the challenge to strike him with his own axe, on the condition that the challenger find him in exactly one year to receive a blow in return.
Stunned, Arthur hesitates to respond, but when the Green Knight mocks Arthur’s silence, the king steps forward to take the challenge. As soon as Arthur grips the Green Knight’s axe, Sir Gawain leaps up and asks to take the challenge himself. He takes hold of the axe and, in one deadly blow, cuts off the knight’s head. To the amazement of the court, the now-headless Green Knight picks up his severed head. Before riding away, the head reiterates the terms of the pact, reminding the young Gawain to seek him in a year and a day at the Green Chapel. After the Green Knight leaves, the company goes back to its festival, but Gawain is uneasy.
Time passes, and autumn arrives. On the Day of All Saints, Gawain prepares to leave Camelot and find the Green Knight. He puts on his best armor, mounts his horse, Gringolet, and starts off toward North Wales, traveling through the wilderness of northwest Britain. Gawain encounters all sorts of beasts, suffers from hunger and cold, and grows more desperate as the days pass. On Christmas Day, he prays to find a place to hear Mass, then looks up to see a castle shimmering in the distance. The lord of the castle welcomes Gawain warmly, introducing him to his lady and to the old woman who sits beside her. For sport, the host (whose name is later revealed to be Bertilak) strikes a deal with Gawain: the host will go out hunting with his men every day, and when he returns in the evening, he will exchange his winnings for anything Gawain has managed to acquire by staying behind at the castle. Gawain happily agrees to the pact, and goes to bed.
The first day, the lord hunts a herd of does, while Gawain sleeps late in his bedchambers. On the morning of the first day, the lord’s wife sneaks into Gawain’s chambers and attempts to seduce him. Gawain puts her off, but before she leaves she steals one kiss from him. That evening, when the host gives Gawain the venison he has captured, Gawain kisses him, since he has won one kiss from the lady. The second day, the lord hunts a wild boar. The lady again enters Gawain’s chambers, and this time she kisses Gawain twice. That evening Gawain gives the host the two kisses in exchange for the boar’s head.
The third day, the lord hunts a fox, and the lady kisses Gawain three times. She also asks him for a love token, such as a ring or a glove. Gawain refuses to give her anything and refuses to take anything from her, until the lady mentions her girdle. The green silk girdle she wears around her waist is no ordinary piece of cloth, the lady claims, but possesses the magical ability to protect the person who wears it from death. Intrigued, Gawain accepts the cloth, but when it comes time to exchange his winnings with the host, Gawain gives the three kisses but does not mention the lady’s green girdle. The host gives Gawain the fox skin he won that day, and they all go to bed happy, but weighed down with the fact that Gawain must leave for the Green Chapel the following morning to find the Green Knight.
New Year’s Day arrives, and Gawain dons his armor, including the girdle, then sets off with Gringolet to seek the Green Knight. A guide accompanies him out of the estate grounds. When they reach the border of the forest, the guide promises not to tell anyone if Gawain decides to give up the quest. Gawain refuses, determined to meet his fate head-on. Eventually, he comes to a kind of crevice in a rock, visible through the tall grasses. He hears the whirring of a grindstone, confirming his suspicion that this strange cavern is in fact the Green Chapel. Gawain calls out, and the Green Knight emerges to greet him. Intent on fulfilling the terms of the contract, Gawain presents his neck to the Green Knight, who proceeds to feign two blows. On the third feint, the Green Knight nicks Gawain’s neck, barely drawing blood. Angered, Gawain shouts that their contract has been met, but the Green Knight merely laughs.
The Green Knight reveals his name, Bertilak, and explains that he is the lord of the castle where Gawain recently stayed. Because Gawain did not honestly exchange all of his winnings on the third day, Bertilak drew blood on his third blow. Nevertheless, Gawain has proven himself a worthy knight, without equal in all the land. When Gawain questions Bertilak further, Bertilak explains that the old woman at the castle is really Morgan le Fay, Gawain’s aunt and King Arthur’s half sister. She sent the Green Knight on his original errand and used her magic to change Bertilak’s appearance. Relieved to be alive but extremely guilty about his sinful failure to tell the whole truth, Gawain wears the girdle on his arm as a reminder of his own failure. He returns to Arthur’s court, where all the knights join Gawain, wearing girdles on their arms to show their support."
Manufacturing,"The convict Jean Valjean is released from a French prison after serving nineteen years for stealing a loaf of bread and for subsequent attempts to escape from prison. When Valjean arrives at the town of Digne, no one is willing to give him shelter because he is an ex-convict. Desperate, Valjean knocks on the door of M. Myriel, the kindly bishop of Digne. Myriel treats Valjean with kindness, and Valjean repays the bishop by stealing his silverware. When the police arrest Valjean, Myriel covers for him, claiming that the silverware was a gift. The authorities release Valjean and Myriel makes him promise to become an honest man. Eager to fulfill his promise, Valjean masks his identity and enters the town of Montreuil-sur-mer. Under the assumed name of Madeleine, Valjean invents an ingenious manufacturing process that brings the town prosperity. He eventually becomes the town’s mayor.
Fantine, a young woman from Montreuil, lives in Paris. She falls in love with Tholomyès, a wealthy student who gets her pregnant and then abandons her. Fantine returns to her home village with her daughter, Cosette. On the way to Montreuil, however, Fantine realizes that she will never be able to find work if the townspeople know that she has an illegitimate child. In the town of Montfermeil, she meets the Thénardiers, a family that runs the local inn. The Thénardiers agree to look after Cosette as long as Fantine sends them a monthly allowance.
In Montreuil, Fantine finds work in Madeleine’s factory. Fantine’s coworkers find out about Cosette, however, and Fantine is fired. The Thénardiers demand more money to support Cosette, and Fantine resorts to prostitution to make ends meet. One night, Javert, Montreuil’s police chief, arrests Fantine. She is to be sent to prison, but Madeleine intervenes. Fantine has fallen ill, and when she longs to see Cosette, Madeleine promises to send for her. First, however, he must contend with Javert, who has discovered Madeleine’s criminal past. Javert tells Madeleine that a man has been accused of being Jean Valjean, and Madeleine confesses his true identity. Javert shows up to arrest Valjean while Valjean is at Fantine’s bedside, and Fantine dies from the shock.
After a few years, Valjean escapes from prison and heads to Montfermeil, where he is able to buy Cosette from the Thénardiers. The Thénardiers turn out to be a family of scoundrels who abuse Cosette while spoiling their own two daughters, Eponine and Azelma. Valjean and Cosette move to a run-down part of Paris. Javert discovers their hideout, however, and they are forced to flee. They find refuge in a convent, where Cosette attends school and Valjean works as a gardener.
Marius Pontmercy is a young man who lives with his wealthy grandfather, M. Gillenormand. Because of political differences within the family, Marius has never met his father, Georges Pontmercy. After his father dies, however, Marius learns more about him and comes to admire his father’s democratic politics. Angry with his grandfather, Marius moves out of Gillenormand’s house and lives as a poor young law student. While in law school, Marius associates with a group of radical students, the Friends of the ABC, who are led by the charismatic Enjolras. One day, Marius sees Cosette at a public park. It is love at first sight, but the protective Valjean does his utmost to prevent Cosette and Marius from ever meeting. Their paths cross once again, however, when Valjean makes a charitable visit to Marius’s poor neighbors, the Jondrettes. The Jondrettes are in fact the Thénardiers, who have lost their inn and moved to Paris under an assumed name. After Valjean leaves, Thénardier announces a plan to rob Valjean when he returns. Alarmed, Marius alerts the local police inspector, who turns out to be Javert. The ambush is foiled and the Thénardiers are arrested, but Valjean escapes before Javert can identify him.
Thénardier’s daughter Eponine, who is in love with Marius, helps Marius discover Cosette’s whereabouts. Marius is finally able to make contact with Cosette, and the two declare their love for each other. Valjean, however, soon shatters their happiness. Worried that he will lose Cosette and unnerved by political unrest in the city, Valjean announces that he and Cosette are moving to England. In desperation, Marius runs to his grandfather, M. Gillenormand, to ask for M. Gillenormand’s permission to marry Cosette. Their meeting ends in a bitter argument. When Marius returns to Cosette, she and Valjean have disappeared. Heartbroken, Marius decides to join his radical student friends, who have started a political uprising. Armed with two pistols, Marius heads for the barricades.
The uprising seems doomed, but Marius and his fellow students nonetheless stand their ground and vow to fight for freedom and democracy. The students discover Javert among their ranks, and, realizing that he is a spy, Enjolras ties him up. As the army launches its first attack against the students, Eponine throws herself in front of a rifle to save Marius’s life. As Eponine dies in Marius’s arms, she hands him a letter from Cosette. Marius quickly scribbles a reply and orders a boy, Gavroche, to deliver it to Cosette.
Valjean manages to intercept the note and sets out to save the life of the man his daughter loves. Valjean arrives at the barricade and volunteers to execute Javert. When alone with Javert, however, Valjean instead secretly lets him go free. As the army storms the barricade, Valjean grabs the wounded Marius and flees through the sewers. When Valjean emerges hours later, Javert immediately arrests him. Valjean pleads with Javert to let him take the dying Marius to Marius’s grandfather. Javert agrees. Javert feels tormented, torn between his duty to his profession and the debt he owes Valjean for saving his life. Ultimately, Javert lets Valjean go and throws himself into the river, where he drowns.
Marius makes a full recovery and is reconciled with Gillenormand, who consents to Marius and Cosette’s marriage. Their wedding is a happy one, marred only when Valjean confesses his criminal past to Marius. Alarmed by this revelation and unaware that it was Valjean who saved his life at the barricades, Marius tries to prevent Cosette from having contact with Valjean. Lonely and depressed, Valjean takes to his bed and awaits his death. Marius eventually finds out from Thénardier that Valjean saved Marius’s life. Ashamed that he mistrusted Valjean, Marius tells Cosette everything that has happened. Marius and Cosette rush to Valjean’s side just in time for a final reconciliation. Happy to be reunited with his adopted daughter, Valjean dies in peace."
Blaze,"Scout Finch lives with her brother, Jem, and their widowed father, Atticus, in the sleepy Alabama town of Maycomb. Maycomb is suffering through the Great Depression, but Atticus is a prominent lawyer and the Finch family is reasonably well off in comparison to the rest of society. One summer, Jem and Scout befriend a boy named Dill, who has come to live in their neighborhood for the summer, and the trio acts out stories together. Eventually, Dill becomes fascinated with the spooky house on their street called the Radley Place. The house is owned by Mr. Nathan Radley, whose brother, Arthur (nicknamed Boo), has lived there for years without venturing outside.
Scout goes to school for the first time that fall and detests it. She and Jem find gifts apparently left for them in a knothole of a tree on the Radley property. Dill returns the following summer, and he, Scout, and Jem begin to act out the story of Boo Radley. Atticus puts a stop to their antics, urging the children to try to see life from another person’s perspective before making judgments. But, on Dill’s last night in Maycomb for the summer, the three sneak onto the Radley property, where Nathan Radley shoots at them. Jem loses his pants in the ensuing escape. When he returns for them, he finds them mended and hung over the fence.
The next winter, Jem and Scout find more presents in the tree, presumably left by the mysterious Boo. Nathan Radley eventually plugs the knothole with cement. Shortly thereafter, a fire breaks out in another neighbor’s house, and during the fire someone slips a blanket on Scout’s shoulders as she watches the blaze. Convinced that Boo did it, Jem tells Atticus about the mended pants and the presents.
To the consternation of Maycomb’s racist white community, Atticus agrees to defend a Black man named Tom Robinson, who has been accused of raping a white woman. Because of Atticus’s decision, Jem and Scout are subjected to abuse from other children, even when they celebrate Christmas at the family compound on Finch’s Landing. Calpurnia, the Finches’ Black cook, takes them to the local Black church, where the warm and close-knit community largely embraces the children.
Atticus’s sister, Alexandra, comes to live with the Finches the next summer. Dill, who is supposed to live with his “new father” in another town, runs away and comes to Maycomb. Tom Robinson’s trial begins, and when the accused man is placed in the local jail, a mob gathers to lynch him. Atticus faces the mob down the night before the trial. Jem and Scout, who have sneaked out of the house, soon join him. Scout recognizes one of the men, and her polite questioning about his son shames him into dispersing the mob.
At the trial itself, the children sit in the “colored balcony” with the town’s Black citizens. Atticus provides clear evidence that the accusers, Mayella Ewell and her father, Bob, are lying: in fact, Mayella propositioned Tom Robinson, was caught by her father, and then accused Tom of rape to cover her shame and guilt. Atticus provides impressive evidence that the marks on Mayella’s face are from wounds that her father inflicted; upon discovering her with Tom, he called her a whore and beat her. Yet, despite the significant evidence pointing to Tom’s innocence, the all-white jury convicts him. The innocent Tom later tries to escape from prison and is shot to death. In the aftermath of the trial, Jem’s faith in justice is badly shaken, and he lapses into despondency and doubt.
Despite the verdict, Bob Ewell feels that Atticus and the judge have made a fool out of him, and he vows revenge. He menaces Tom Robinson’s widow, tries to break into the judge’s house, and finally attacks Jem and Scout as they walk home from a Halloween party. Boo Radley intervenes, however, saving the children and stabbing Ewell fatally during the struggle. Boo carries the wounded Jem back to Atticus’s house, where the sheriff, in order to protect Boo, insists that Ewell tripped over a tree root and fell on his own knife. After sitting with Scout for a while, Boo disappears once more into the Radley house.  
Later, Scout feels as though she can finally imagine what life is like for Boo. He has become a human being to her at last. With this realization, Scout embraces her father’s advice to practice sympathy and understanding and demonstrates that her experiences with hatred and prejudice will not sully her faith in human goodness."
Igniting,"In the midst of a raging war, a plane evacuating a group of schoolboys from Britain is shot down over a deserted tropical island. Two of the boys, Ralph and Piggy, discover a conch shell on the beach, and Piggy realizes it could be used as a horn to summon the other boys. Once assembled, the boys set about electing a leader and devising a way to be rescued. They choose Ralph as their leader, and Ralph appoints another boy, Jack, to be in charge of the boys who will hunt food for the entire group.
Ralph, Jack, and another boy, Simon, set off on an expedition to explore the island. When they return, Ralph declares that they must light a signal fire to attract the attention of passing ships. The boys succeed in igniting some dead wood by focusing sunlight through the lenses of Piggy’s eyeglasses. However, the boys pay more attention to playing than to monitoring the fire, and the flames quickly engulf the forest. A large swath of dead wood burns out of control, and one of the youngest boys in the group disappears, presumably having burned to death.
At first, the boys enjoy their life without grown-ups and spend much of their time splashing in the water and playing games. Ralph, however, complains that they should be maintaining the signal fire and building huts for shelter. The hunters fail in their attempt to catch a wild pig, but their leader, Jack, becomes increasingly preoccupied with the act of hunting.
When a ship passes by on the horizon one day, Ralph and Piggy notice, to their horror, that the signal fire—which had been the hunters’ responsibility to maintain—has burned out. Furious, Ralph accosts Jack, but the hunter has just returned with his first kill, and all the hunters seem gripped with a strange frenzy, reenacting the chase in a kind of wild dance. Piggy criticizes Jack, who hits Piggy across the face. Ralph blows the conch shell and reprimands the boys in a speech intended to restore order. At the meeting, it quickly becomes clear that some of the boys have started to become afraid. The littlest boys, known as “littluns,” have been troubled by nightmares from the beginning, and more and more boys now believe that there is some sort of beast or monster lurking on the island. The older boys try to convince the others at the meeting to think rationally, asking where such a monster could possibly hide during the daytime. One of the littluns suggests that it hides in the sea—a proposition that terrifies the entire group.
Not long after the meeting, some military planes engage in a battle high above the island. The boys, asleep below, do not notice the flashing lights and explosions in the clouds. A parachutist drifts to earth on the signal-fire mountain, dead. Sam and Eric, the twins responsible for watching the fire at night, are asleep and do not see the parachutist land. When the twins wake up, they see the enormous silhouette of his parachute and hear the strange flapping noises it makes. Thinking the island beast is at hand, they rush back to the camp in terror and report that the beast has attacked them.
The boys organize a hunting expedition to search for the monster. Jack and Ralph, who are increasingly at odds, travel up the mountain. They see the silhouette of the parachute from a distance and think that it looks like a huge, deformed ape. The group holds a meeting at which Jack and Ralph tell the others of the sighting. Jack says that Ralph is a coward and that he should be removed from office, but the other boys refuse to vote Ralph out of power. Jack angrily runs away down the beach, calling all the hunters to join him. Ralph rallies the remaining boys to build a new signal fire, this time on the beach rather than on the mountain. They obey, but before they have finished the task, most of them have slipped away to join Jack.
Jack declares himself the leader of the new tribe of hunters and organizes a hunt and a violent, ritual slaughter of a sow to solemnize the occasion. The hunters then decapitate the sow and place its head on a sharpened stake in the jungle as an offering to the beast. Later, encountering the bloody, fly-covered head, Simon has a terrible vision, during which it seems to him that the head is speaking. The voice, which he imagines as belonging to the Lord of the Flies, says that Simon will never escape him, for he exists within all men. Simon faints. When he wakes up, he goes to the mountain, where he sees the dead parachutist. Understanding then that the beast does not exist externally but rather within each individual boy, Simon travels to the beach to tell the others what he has seen. But the others are in the midst of a chaotic revelry—even Ralph and Piggy have joined Jack’s feast—and when they see Simon’s shadowy figure emerge from the jungle, they fall upon him and kill him with their bare hands and teeth.
The following morning, Ralph and Piggy discuss what they have done. Jack’s hunters attack them and their few followers and steal Piggy’s glasses in the process. Ralph’s group travels to Jack’s stronghold in an attempt to make Jack see reason, but Jack orders Sam and Eric tied up and fights with Ralph. In the ensuing battle, one boy, Roger, rolls a boulder down the mountain, killing Piggy and shattering the conch shell. Ralph barely manages to escape a torrent of spears.
Ralph hides for the rest of the night and the following day, while the others hunt him like an animal. Jack has the other boys ignite the forest in order to smoke Ralph out of his hiding place. Ralph stays in the forest, where he discovers and destroys the sow’s head, but eventually, he is forced out onto the beach, where he knows the other boys will soon arrive to kill him. Ralph collapses in exhaustion, but when he looks up, he sees a British naval officer standing over him. The officer’s ship noticed the fire raging in the jungle. The other boys reach the beach and stop in their tracks at the sight of the officer. Amazed at the spectacle of this group of bloodthirsty, savage children, the officer asks Ralph to explain. Ralph is overwhelmed by the knowledge that he is safe but, thinking about what has happened on the island, he begins to weep. The other boys begin to sob as well. The officer turns his back so that the boys may regain their composure."
Pledging,"The year is 1775, and social ills plague both France and England. Jerry Cruncher, an odd-job man who works for Tellson’s Bank, stops the Dover mail-coach with an urgent message for Jarvis Lorry. The message instructs Lorry to wait at Dover for a young woman, and Lorry responds with the cryptic words, “Recalled to Life.” At Dover, Lorry is met by Lucie Manette, a young orphan whose father, a once-eminent doctor whom she supposed dead, has been discovered in France. Lorry escorts Lucie to Paris, where they meet Defarge, a former servant of Doctor Manette, who has kept Manette safe in a garret. Driven mad by eighteen years in the Bastille, Manette spends all of his time making shoes, a hobby he learned while in prison. Lorry assures Lucie that her love and devotion can recall her father to life, and indeed they do.
The year is now 1780. Charles Darnay stands accused of treason against the English crown. A bombastic lawyer named Stryver pleads Darnay’s case, but it is not until his drunk, good-for-nothing colleague, Sydney Carton, assists him that the court acquits Darnay. Carton clinches his argument by pointing out that he himself bears an uncanny resemblance to the defendant, which undermines the prosecution’s case for unmistakably identifying Darnay as the spy the authorities spotted. Lucie and Doctor Manette watched the court proceedings, and that night, Carton escorts Darnay to a tavern and asks how it feels to receive the sympathy of a woman like Lucie. Carton despises and resents Darnay because he reminds him of all that he himself has given up and might have been.
In France, the cruel Marquis Evrémonde runs down a plebian child with his carriage. Manifesting an attitude typical of the aristocracy in regard to the poor at that time, the Marquis shows no regret, but instead curses the peasantry and hurries home to his chateau, where he awaits the arrival of his nephew, Darnay, from England. Arriving later that night, Darnay curses his uncle and the French aristocracy for its abominable treatment of the people. He renounces his identity as an Evrémonde and announces his intention to return to England. That night, the Marquis is murdered; the murderer has left a note signed with the nickname adopted by French revolutionaries: “Jacques.”
A year passes, and Darnay asks Manette for permission to marry Lucie. He says that, if Lucie accepts, he will reveal his true identity to Manette. Carton, meanwhile, also pledges his love to Lucie, admitting that, though his life is worthless, she has helped him dream of a better, more valuable existence. On the streets of London, Jerry Cruncher gets swept up in the funeral procession for a spy named Roger Cly. Later that night, he demonstrates his talents as a “Resurrection-Man,” sneaking into the cemetery to steal and sell Cly’s body. In Paris, meanwhile, another English spy known as John Barsad drops into Defarge’s wine shop. Barsad hopes to turn up evidence concerning the mounting revolution, which is still in its covert stages. Madame Defarge sits in the shop knitting a secret registry of those whom the revolution seeks to execute. Back in London, Darnay, on the morning of his wedding, keeps his promise to Manette; he reveals his true identity and, that night, Manette relapses into his old prison habit of making shoes. After nine days, Manette regains his presence of mind, and soon joins the newlyweds on their honeymoon. Upon Darnay’s return, Carton pays him a visit and asks for his friendship. Darnay assures Carton that he is always welcome in their home.
The year is now 1789. The peasants in Paris storm the Bastille and the French Revolution begins. The revolutionaries murder aristocrats in the streets, and Gabelle, a man charged with the maintenance of the Evrémonde estate, is imprisoned. Three years later, he writes to Darnay, asking to be rescued. Despite the threat of great danger to his person, Darnay departs immediately for France.
As soon as Darnay arrives in Paris, the French revolutionaries arrest him as an emigrant. Lucie and Manette make their way to Paris in hopes of saving him. Darnay remains in prison for a year and three months before receiving a trial. In order to help free him, Manette uses his considerable influence with the revolutionaries, who sympathize with him for having served time in the Bastille. Darnay receives an acquittal, but that same night he is arrested again. The charges, this time, come from Defarge and his vengeful wife. Carton arrives in Paris with a plan to rescue Darnay and obtains the help of John Barsad, who turns out to be Solomon Pross, the long-lost brother of Miss Pross, Lucie’s loyal servant.
At Darnay’s trial, Defarge produces a letter that he discovered in Manette’s old jail cell in the Bastille. The letter explains the cause of Manette’s imprisonment. Years ago, the brothers Evrémonde (Darnay’s father and uncle) enlisted Manette’s medical assistance. They asked him to tend to a woman, whom one of the brothers had raped, and her brother, whom the same brother had stabbed fatally. Fearing that Manette might report their misdeeds, the Evrémondes had him arrested. Upon hearing this story, the jury condemns Darnay for the crimes of his ancestors and sentences him to die within twenty-four hours. That night, at the Defarge’s wine shop, Carton overhears Madame Defarge plotting to have Lucie and her daughter (also Darnay’s daughter) executed as well; Madame Defarge, it turns out, is the surviving sibling of the man and woman killed by the Evrémondes. Carton arranges for the Manettes’ immediate departure from France. He then visits Darnay in prison, tricks him into changing clothes with him, and, after dictating a letter of explanation, drugs his friend unconscious. Barsad carries Darnay, now disguised as Carton, to an awaiting coach, while Carton, disguised as Darnay, awaits execution. As Darnay, Lucie, their child, and Dr. Manette speed away from Paris, Madame Defarge arrives at Lucie’s apartment, hoping to arrest her. There she finds the supremely protective Miss Pross. A scuffle ensues, and Madame Defarge dies by the bullet of her own gun. Sydney Carton meets his death at the guillotine, and the narrator confidently asserts that Carton dies with the knowledge that he has finally imbued his life with meaning."
Thomas,"Thomas wakes up in a swaying elevator, and the only thing he can remember is his first name. The elevator, called the Box, opens up, and a group of boys lower a rope for Thomas and pull him out. The boys live in a place called the Glade, a courtyard which is surrounded by an enormous labyrinth of 100-foot stone walls called the Maze. Alby, a dark-skinned boy who has been there the longest, is the leader, and his sidekick is a blond boy named Newt. For the past two years, a new boy has appeared in the Box every month. Thomas, confused and upset, demands an explanation about where he is and what’s going on, but when screams sound from a nearby building, the boys leave him with the young, pudgy Chuck, who will become like a brother to Thomas.
The screams are from a boy named Ben; he was stung by a Griever, one of the monsters that lives in the Maze. After receiving an antidote called Grief Serum, Ben is going through “the Changing,” a painful process during which the victim is flooded with memories of his life before the Maze. Gally, a bully who went through the Changing and recovered, confronts Thomas, saying that he saw Thomas during his Changing and doesn’t trust him.
Before dark, four boy run out through four “Doors” in the walls of the Maze, the walls sliding closed behind them. Chuck tells Thomas that these are the Maze Runners, and Thomas feels drawn to become one. The Runners are trying to find a way out of the Maze, and each night, in a concrete room, they map out the eight sections of the Maze. But the internal walls shift every night, creating multiple variations of the Maze, and, so far, they haven’t been able to identify an escape route. 
Before dawn the next morning, Newt shows Thomas a Griever through a window in one of the walls. It’s a “horrifying mix of animal and machine,” an enormous monster with metal arms that are capped with saws and shears. Grievers patrol the Maze at night, stinging any boy unlucky enough to be there. Alby explains that the Glade is divided into four areas: the Gardens, where they grow food, the Blood House, where they raise and butcher animals, the Homestead, where they live, and the Deadheads forest, which serves as a graveyard.
An alarm blares out through the Glade, and, for the first time ever, a girl arrives in the Box. She babbles incoherently and then falls into a coma, holding a note reading that reads, “She’s the last one. Ever.” The girl seems familiar to Thomas, but he doesn’t know why. Later, Thomas sees a metal beetle engraved with the word WICKED; the beetle is a spy from the Creators of the Maze. Thomas goes into the Deadheads forest, where he is attacked by a delirious Ben. Before Ben can stab Thomas, Alby shoots an arrow through Ben’s face, wounding but not killing him.
While Thomas is working in the Blood House, he sees an Asian Runner collapse on the lawn. This Runner, Minho, tells Alby and Thomas that he found a dead Griever in the Maze. At dusk, the leaders, called Keepers, bring Ben from prison and push him into the Maze for attempting to murder Thomas. Ben shrieks and howls in terror as the walls close on him.
The next day, Minho and Alby go into the Maze to find the Griever, who, it turns out, was only pretending to be dead. By dinner, they haven’t returned. At the West Door, Thomas sees Minho half-carrying Alby, who has been stung. When Thomas realizes that they won’t make it into the Glade before the Doors close, he jumps into the Maze to help them.
Thomas secures himself and Alby high onto the wall with ivy ropes. A Griever appears, pursues Thomas, and is joined by three Grievers. Using an evasive maneuver, Minho and Thomas trick the Grievers into going off a cliff within the Maze, where they are instantly swallowed up by darkness. 
The next day, Alby is still alive on the wall, and he is taken down by other Gladers and given the Grief Serum. The Keepers are divided on what to do about Thomas: he violated the rules by entering the Maze, but he also saved Alby’s life. Minho and Gally fight over Thomas’ fate, and it’s finally decided that Thomas will spend the next day in the Slammer (the Glade’s jail), then join Minho as a Runner.
Word comes that Alby is awake and that he wants to talk to Thomas alone. Alby tells Thomas that during the Changing he learned some disturbing things about Thomas and the girl, and that he knows about “the Flare,” which means nothing to Thomas. Just as Alby is explain further, he starts to strangle himself. After Alby is restrained with Newt’s help, he says that an outside force was in control of his hands. Alby then gives Newt two instructions: “Be careful with the girl,” and “protect the Maps.”
When Thomas visits the girl, she tells him telepathically that her name is Teresa. In her coma, she still has memories and says she and Thomas caused this and were sent to end it. Thomas retreats to sleep in the south corner of the Deadheads.
After his day in jail, Thomas joins Minho. They run through Sections Eight and One of the Maze, then draw maps of those sections and add them to a trunk holding all the other daily maps. The other Runners do the same. That night, Teresa telepathically tells Thomas she has “triggered the Ending.” 
The next morning, the boys wake up to find that the sun has disappeared and the Glade is bathed in grey light. More disturbing is the fact that the walls of the Maze are now stuck in the open position, meaning that there’s nothing protecting the Glade from Grievers. Back in the Maze, Thomas and Minho follow a Griever, and when they see it throw itself off the cliff, they realize there’s a hole through which Grievers enter and exit the Maze. Teresa wakes up, and she and Thomas, who have a connection they don’t fully understand, speak to each other telepathically. Teresa is locked in the Slammer, and everyone else prepares for the Grievers to come through the open Maze doors into the Glade. 
Barricaded in a Homestead room, Newt, Alby, Minho, and Thomas hear the Grievers approach. Alby, very troubled, runs to the Map room. Gally bursts in and says the Grievers will kill one Glader each night until they’re all dead. As a Griever breaks through the window, Gally throws himself at it. The Griever takes Gally through the West Door and the other Grievers follow.
Alby has burned the Maps, but it turns out that Minho had already moved the real Maps to protect them. Teresa realizes that the Maps are a code, and that by stacking each day’s eight maps together, they can read letters, one letter each day. The Maps spell out six repeating words: FLOAT, CATCH, BLEED, DEATH, STIFF, PUSH. To gain more information, Thomas intentionally gets stung by a Griever, goes through the Changing, and realizes in his visions that the only way to escape the Maze is to jump into the Griever Hole and type in the code words. 
After a Gathering, the Keepers agree to the dangerous plan, and about half the Gladers assemble to escape. In the Maze, they’re surrounded by Grievers, but they fight valiantly to make a path for Thomas, Teresa, and Chuck to get to the Cliff. The three make it through the Hole and land in a greasy tunnel. Teresa types the words into a computer while Thomas fights, and kills, a Griever. The last word, PUSH, won’t enter, and Chuck realizes they need to push a button marked “Kill the Maze.” 
Thomas, Teresa, and Chuck by the eighteen surviving Gladers, including Newt and Minho, and they go down a winding slide, landing in an enormous lab. Ghostly scientists observe them. A woman enters the room with a boy who reveals himself to be Gally. Gally throws a knife at Thomas, but Chuck steps in to protect him and is killed. As Thomas grieves Chuck, an armed group arrives. They shoot the woman and scientists and lead the Gladers to a bus. 
One of the rescuers explains to Thomas that the world was burned up by a series of solar flares and then consumed by a disease they call the Flare. It’s rumored that there’s a cure in the Andes, and WICKED, the Creators’ organization, was testing orphaned children to see if they were tenacious enough to try and recover the cure. The Gladers are taken to a bright dormitory and given pizza, after which they fall asleep. 
A memo reveals that the woman in the lab, Ava Paige, was not actually killed, and that the “rescuers” are actually a part of the WICKED plan. WICKED will give the survivors, called Group A, one night’s sleep before sending them on the next part of the experiment. Another group, Group B, is reported to also have performed well."
Usual,"Ordinary People is set in Lake Forest, Illinois, during the 1970s. The action focuses on the Jarrett family--Calvin and Beth and their son Conrad. Before the action of the book begins, there was a second Jarrett son--Buck--who was killed in a boating accident over a year before the novel begins. After the death of Buck, Conrad became deeply troubled, blaming himself. He tried to commit suicide by slashing his wrists; his attempt failed when Calvin found him, before he died, in the bathtub. After the attempt, Conrad was hospitalized. He went through therapy and befriended Karen, a girl his age who had also tried to kill herself.
The action of the book begins a month after Conrad is released from the hospital. While he is physically cured, he is by no means emotionally cured, and at the request of his father, he begins to see a psychiatrist, Dr. Berger. He tells Berger that he doesn't think highly of psychiatry, but he wants Berger to help him gain more control over others so that he can make his father stop worrying about him. Conrad goes back to school, where he has experienced a severe academic downturn ever since Buck's death. He is a junior, and he is a member of the swimming team. However, he feels he is becoming alienated from even some of his best friends, such as Joe Lazenby, and ends up becoming more and more isolated. He decides to quit the swimming team, although he does not tell his parents about the decision until a month later. He spends his time instead in the library after school. He even goes out for a Coke with his old friend Karen at one point, and he sees that she is doing much better. As the year progresses, he becomes interested in a girl at school named Jeannine Pratt, who is new to Lake Forest. They go out a couple of times before they start to date seriously towards the end of the year. Meanwhile, Conrad continues to see Berger, although it is unclear whether he is making much progress. The novel focuses on his family life, and we see that Conrad is becoming increasingly alienated from his mother, who is not interested in pampering him or dwelling on the past. His relationship with his father is somewhat strained as well.
During the winter, Conrad goes to see a swim meet on a whim, and afterwards he gets into a fist fight with an old friend who has begun to treat him cruelly. In some ways, it is unclear whether Conrad is really getting better. His father grows increasingly concerned about him. That spring, he goes to stay with his grandparents while his parents go on vacation to Houston. There, he spends lots of time with Jeannine. One night, however, he reads in the newspaper that his friend Karen has committed suicide. He is suddenly thrown into shock, and he spends the whole night in a dream-like trance thinking about his time with Karen, his own suicide attempt, and the death of his brother. He goes out walking at 2 am to think some more, and he is stopped by a police officer and told to return home. He falls back into a dream at home and then wakes up at dawn. He immediately calls Berger and requests to meet with him. In Berger's office, Conrad has a breakdown and admits that he blames himself for the death of Buck. Berger tells him to stop blaming himself and to stop trying to fill Buck's shoes; Conrad needs to allow himself to feel more even when he feels bad, and he needs to be himself for a change. After this breakdown and release of emotion, Conrad begins to heal substantially, enjoying a great relationship with Jeannine. At the end of the novel, he has moved to Evanston with his family, and in the Epilogue we see him rebuilding his old friendship with Lazenby.
The story of Conrad is told opposite the story of his father, Calvin, who spends most of his time in the novel worrying about Conrad. Calvin is a tax attorney who runs a small firm with his partner, Ray Hanley. Most of the chapters devoted to Calvin depict him by himself, thinking about the past and his son and wife. It is clear from the beginning that Calvin and Beth have serious communication problems. Essentially, Calvin wants to talk through the past with his family; he believes that talking is the way to heal. Beth, however, abhors Calvin's philosophy: she only wants to move on and leave the past behind. She also constantly criticizes her husband for pampering Conrad. She thinks Conrad ought to be left to grow up on his own without parents breathing down his neck all the time. Indeed, Beth thinks that she managed to heal her own hurts on her own, and she does not understand why everyone else can't do the same. Calvin and Beth attend parties together and spend lots of time with their own friends, and we see them in numerous situations. As the novel progresses, however, the communication rift between Beth and Calvin only widens. They fight more and more about how to treat Conrad. They also fight about vacations. Beth feels that the family must get away from Illinois for Christmas, but Calvin makes them stay in Lake Forest in hopes that they can talk through their problems as a family. In the spring, they take a golfing trip to Houston together; however, things blow up when Beth again rails on Calvin for his obsession with Conrad. When they return to Illinois, they hardly speak to one another until Beth announces to Calvin that she is leaving for Europe. While they do not talk about divorce, their differences seem irrevocable by the end of the novel. After Beth leaves, however, Conrad and Calvin really come together for the first time in the novel, saying that they love each other and showing an interest in developing a better relationship. Calvin and Conrad move to Evanston."
Fisheries,"The Old Man and the Sea is the story of an epic struggle between an old, seasoned fisherman and the greatest catch of his life. For eighty-four days, Santiago, an aged Cuban fisherman, has set out to sea and returned empty-handed. So conspicuously unlucky is he that the parents of his young, devoted apprentice and friend, Manolin, have forced the boy to leave the old man in order to fish in a more prosperous boat. Nevertheless, the boy continues to care for the old man upon his return each night. He helps the old man tote his gear to his ramshackle hut, secures food for him, and discusses the latest developments in American baseball, especially the trials of the old man’s hero, Joe DiMaggio. Santiago is confident that his unproductive streak will soon come to an end, and he resolves to sail out farther than usual the following day.
On the eighty-fifth day of his unlucky streak, Santiago does as promised, sailing his skiff far beyond the island’s shallow coastal waters and venturing into the Gulf Stream. He prepares his lines and drops them. At noon, a big fish, which he knows is a marlin, takes the bait that Santiago has placed one hundred fathoms deep in the waters. The old man expertly hooks the fish, but he cannot pull it in. Instead, the fish begins to pull the boat.
Unable to tie the line fast to the boat for fear the fish would snap a taut line, the old man bears the strain of the line with his shoulders, back, and hands, ready to give slack should the marlin make a run. The fish pulls the boat all through the day, through the night, through another day, and through another night. It swims steadily northwest until at last it tires and swims east with the current. The entire time, Santiago endures constant pain from the fishing line. Whenever the fish lunges, leaps, or makes a dash for freedom, the cord cuts Santiago badly. Although wounded and weary, the old man feels a deep empathy and admiration for the marlin, his brother in suffering, strength, and resolve.
On the third day the fish tires, and Santiago, sleep-deprived, aching, and nearly delirious, manages to pull the marlin in close enough to kill it with a harpoon thrust. Dead beside the skiff, the marlin is the largest Santiago has ever seen. He lashes it to his boat, raises the small mast, and sets sail for home. While Santiago is excited by the price that the marlin will bring at market, he is more concerned that the people who will eat the fish are unworthy of its greatness.
As Santiago sails on with the fish, the marlin’s blood leaves a trail in the water and attracts sharks. The first to attack is a great mako shark, which Santiago manages to slay with the harpoon. In the struggle, the old man loses the harpoon and lengths of valuable rope, which leaves him vulnerable to other shark attacks. The old man fights off the successive vicious predators as best he can, stabbing at them with a crude spear he makes by lashing a knife to an oar, and even clubbing them with the boat’s tiller. Although he kills several sharks, more and more appear, and by the time night falls, Santiago’s continued fight against the scavengers is useless. They devour the marlin’s precious meat, leaving only skeleton, head, and tail. Santiago chastises himself for going “out too far,” and for sacrificing his great and worthy opponent. He arrives home before daybreak, stumbles back to his shack, and sleeps very deeply.
The next morning, a crowd of amazed fishermen gathers around the skeletal carcass of the fish, which is still lashed to the boat. Knowing nothing of the old man’s struggle, tourists at a nearby café observe the remains of the giant marlin and mistake it for a shark. Manolin, who has been worried sick over the old man’s absence, is moved to tears when he finds Santiago safe in his bed. The boy fetches the old man some coffee and the daily papers with the baseball scores, and watches him sleep. When the old man wakes, the two agree to fish as partners once more. The old man returns to sleep and dreams his usual dream of lions at play on the beaches of Africa."
Vision,"Margery Kempe is a well-off middle-class townswoman in the medieval English town of King’s Lynn. After the birth of her first child, Margery has a nervous breakdown, seeing hideous devils all around her. Margery recovers after having a vision of Jesus Christ, and she decides to devote her life to holiness and contemplation of God. One of the first hurdles Margery has to overcome is convincing her husband to live a life of celibacy with her—she succeeds only after having fourteen children. After the failure of a brewing business she starts, Margery becomes certain that God wants her to turn away from the world. Margery’s devotion to Jesus is highly emotional and dramatic, and she soon acquires a reputation as a religious eccentric, a potentially dangerous reputation in a time when heresy was a capital offense. Margery faces doubt and temptation, especially sexual temptation, but she perseveres and often receives guidance in her visions.
Margery makes several pilgrimages, the longest and most difficult of which is a journey to Jerusalem, with a long stopover in Rome. During the pilgrimage, Margery is shunned by her fellow travelers but is often accepted by the poor, a pattern that repeats itself throughout her life. In Jerusalem, Margery has several intense visions, and she begins to have spells in which she sobs and cries uncontrollably. These crying fits come upon her most often during religious services, but they also occur whenever she simply thinks of Jesus or sees something that reminds her of his suffering. Margery is stranded in Rome for a time after giving away her money to the poor, and she makes her way by begging. Margery’s extreme behavior begins to make her notorious, and she makes enemies among the English contingent in Rome. Eventually, Margery is given enough money to return home.
Upon her return to England, Margery does her best to live a life of devotion to Christ. As a married woman, however, she is somewhat constrained, such as by the fact that she cannot become a nun. Margery travels to various churches and holy sites in England, attracting attention wherever she goes, thanks to her public weeping and her all-white wardrobe. At times, Margery is accepted as a holy woman, and her advice and blessings are solicited. More often, she is treated as an oddity or a nuisance and mocked. On occasion, the hostile attention she draws goes beyond mockery. Traveling through the north of England, Margery is arrested several times and almost burned at the stake as a heretic, though she is saved by the intervention of the church authorities. Each time she is arrested, Margery defends herself vigorously. She is respectful to authority but firm in her beliefs, none of which are heretical, as her examiners soon see.
Margery continues to have mystical visions of Jesus, the Virgin Mary, and several saints. Margery’s devotion to Christ is particularly intense and is expressed in highly physical, even sexual, terms. In her visions, Margery often sees herself as a servant to Mary or Jesus, acting as an eyewitness to the events of the gospels. Jesus speaks to Margery in her visions of such subjects as the Trinity, the salvation and damnation of souls, and the meaning of the constant tears he sends her. Margery tries to spend as much time as she can in prayer or in conversation with her spiritual guides. Even so, her dramatic weeping in church and elsewhere continues to draw attention and, often, censure. Margery comes into particular conflict with a friar who moves to Lynn and refuses to allow Margery to hear him preach because of her disruptive weeping.
As time goes on, Margery’s husband becomes old and infirm, and Margery returns to his household to care for him. One of Margery’s sons turns from his sinful ways after much praying and beseeching by Margery, and he marries a German woman. The couple comes to England for a visit, and the son takes ill and dies, soon followed by his father. In her last extended journey, Margery accompanies her daughter-in-law (who is less than enthusiastic about being joined by her odd mother-in-law) back to Germany, only deciding to leave at the last minute. Margery’s trip overland from Germany to France is her most grueling yet, and she is again scorned by other travelers from England, to whom she turns for help. Eventually, Margery makes it to London and finally back to Lynn. Home once again, Margery, now an old woman, decides to record the story of her life and her devotions, and begins the dictation of her Book."
Penalizes,"A wake-up call sounds in a Stalinist labor camp in 1951, on a bitterly cold winter morning. Ivan Denisovich Shukhov, a prisoner in Camp HQ, is usually up on time, but this morning he suffers a fever and aches, and yearns for a little more time in bed. Thinking that a kindly guard is on duty, he rests past the wake-up call a while. Unfortunately, a different guard is making the rounds, and he punishes Shukhov for oversleeping with three days in the solitary confinement cell, which the characters call “the hole.” Led off, Shukhov soon realizes that the sentence is just a threat, and that he will only have to wash the floors of the officers’ headquarters. Shukhov removes his shoes and efficiently completes the job, proceeding quickly to the mess hall, where he worries he has missed breakfast. He meets the sniveling Fetyukov, a colleague who has saved Shukhov’s gruel for him. After breakfast, Shukhov heads to sick bay to get his fever and aches examined. The medical orderly, Kolya, tells him he should have been ill the previous night, since the clinic is closed in the morning. Shukhov’s fever is not high enough to get him off work.
Shukhov returns to the hut in time for the body search and body count, in which the prisoners are searched for forbidden articles and counted to make sure none have escaped. He carefully hides the bread he has taken at breakfast, sewing it into his mattress. The men undress in the freezing cold for the search. One inmate, Buynovsky, is wearing a flannel vest. He is sentenced to ten days in the hole for this infraction. Shukhov is happy not to have any forbidden things on him. He has neither food nor letters to his family, which he does not write anymore. He reflects on his wife’s recent letter urging him to take up carpet-dyeing when he gets out of prison. But Shukhov is not interested in this opportunity, despite the easy money.
After the search, Shukhov’s group, Gang 104, is marched off for work at the Power Station, a building site in the open fields. At the site, Shukhov looks at his colleague Alyoshka, a devout Baptist who seems happy to slave away. Shukhov is filled with respect for his foreman, Tyurin, a big tough man with a decent soul. Though they are forbidden to do so, the men try to keep the wind out of the windows by covering them with tar paper. The teenage prisoner Gopchik fetches wire for piping, and asks Shukhov to show him how to make a spoon. They all rest a while. It is too soon before the noon meal to start laying bricks, as the mortar would only dry in the trough while they ate.
At the noon meal, Shukhov sneaks a second helping of food. He is full after eating two bowls of gruel. The gang returns to the work site. On the way, Shukhov spots a bit of scrap metal in the snow, which he takes and hides in the hopes of making a knife out of it later. The prisoners stoke the stove. While preparing to work again, the gang hears Tyurin’s tale of being imprisoned for having a rich peasant father. The men begin to mortar the wall. One of the deputy foremen, Pavlo, agrees to be on the mortar team, though, as an officer, he is not required to mortar. Pavlo’s friendliness earns him the men’s respect. The bricklaying begins. Shukhov works feverishly and makes no errors. A camp manager stops by to chide Tyurin for the tar paper illegally hung in the work site windows. He threatens to punish Tyurin, but Tyurin waves him off. Alyoshka works selflessly. Time passes quickly, and the men hear the meal signal. Shukhov continues working, even after his colleague Kildigs has stopped. He is late to lunch now, but he wants to hide his precious trowel, a tool that is hard to get, so that another man will not take it. He is nearly unable to join his gang, but catches up when the gang is delayed by preparations for another body count. The men discover that a man from Moldavia is missing from another gang. The man, who has fallen asleep at the site, is finally found. The other men are furious at him for delaying their meal.
Shukhov remembers his earlier intention to go to sick bay but reflects that he would rather have supper. At the body search, Shukhov suddenly panics, remembering the bit of steel he has hidden in his mitten. He prays to God to be kept out of the hole. By a stroke of good luck, the guard does not discover the bit of steel. Shukhov returns to the camp. On the suspicion that a fellow inmate, Tsezar, has received a rich parcel of food, he offers to wait in line in the parcel room for Tsezar. Shukhov waits until Tsezar comes. There is indeed a package. Shukhov makes his way to the mess hall for supper, where the gangs are being admitted by twos instead of singly, creating a chaos inside. He manages to find his comrades, grab an empty tray, and bring their rations to the table. For his outstanding labor at the Power Station, Shukhov has been awarded 400 grams of bread. He eats in bliss, eyeing his extra rations to make sure no one grabs them. He takes Tsezar’s ration to the hut, where Tsezar, in exception to the camp rules, is allowed to eat. Tsezar has displayed the contents of his parcel to everyone, and he allows Shukhov to keep Tsezar’s supper ration.
After the body count, Shukhov prepares to sleep, though the second count has not yet been completed. He revels in his abundance of bread. At the second roll call, Tsezar panics, unsure what to do with his parcel. Shukhov helps him guard it from the other prisoners. Tsezar rewards Shukhov with a couple of biscuits and a bit of sausage. Before sleeping, Shukhov thanks God for getting him through another day. Alyoshka hears Shukhov’s prayer, and urges Shukhov to pray properly. He also encourages Shukhov to pursue the goods of the spirit and not, as Tsezar does, those of the flesh. Shukhov reflects on Alyoshka’s sentiment. Suddenly, for no reason, he hands Alyoshka one of his biscuits. Shukhov meditates that his day has been almost happy. The narrator adds that this day has been just one of the 3,653 days of Shukhov’s sentence."
Sweep,"Note:  Billy Pilgrim, the novel’s protagonist, has become “unstuck in time.” He travels between periods of his life, unable to control which period he lands in. As a result, the narrative is not chronological or linear. Instead, it jumps back and forth in time and place. The novel is structured in small sections, each several paragraphs long, that describe various moments of his life.

Billy Pilgrim is born in 1922 and grows up in Ilium, New York. A funny-looking, weak youth, he does reasonably well in high school, enrolls in night classes at the Ilium School of Optometry, and is drafted into the army during World War II. He trains as a chaplain’s assistant in South Carolina, where an umpire officiates during practice battles and announces who survives and who dies before they all sit down to lunch together. Billy’s father dies in a hunting accident shortly before Billy ships overseas to join an infantry regiment in Luxembourg. Billy is thrown into the Battle of the Bulge in Belgium and is immediately taken prisoner behind German lines. Just before his capture, he experiences his first incident of time—shifting: he sees the entirety of his life, from beginning to end, in one sweep.
Billy is transported in a crowded railway boxcar to a POW camp in Germany. Upon his arrival, he and the other privates are treated to a feast by a group of fellow prisoners, who are English officers who were captured earlier in the war. Billy suffers a breakdown and gets a shot of morphine that sends him time-tripping again. Soon he and the other Americans travel onward to the beautiful city of Dresden, still relatively untouched by wartime privation. Here the prisoners must work for their keep at various labors, including the manufacture of a nutritional malt syrup. Their camp occupies a former slaughterhouse. One night, Allied forces carpet bomb the city, then drop incendiary bombs to create a firestorm that sucks most of the oxygen into the blaze, asphyxiating or incinerating roughly 130,000 people. Billy and his fellow POWs survive in an airtight meat locker. They emerge to find a moonscape of destruction, where they are forced to excavate corpses from the rubble. Several days later, Russian forces capture the city, and Billy’s involvement in the war ends.
Billy returns to Ilium and finishes optometry school. He gets engaged to Valencia Merble, the obese daughter of the school’s founder. After a nervous breakdown, Billy commits himself to a veterans’ hospital and receives shock treatments. During his stay in the mental ward, a fellow patient introduces Billy to the science fiction novels of a writer named Kilgore Trout. After his recuperation, Billy gets married. His wealthy father-in-law sets him up in the optometry business, and Billy and Valencia raise two children and grow rich. Billy acquires the trappings of the suburban American dream: a Cadillac, a stately home with modern appliances, a bejeweled wife, and the presidency of the Lions Club. He is not aware of keeping any secrets from himself, but at his eighteenth wedding anniversary party the sight of a barbershop quartet makes him break down because, he realizes, it triggers a memory of Dresden.
The night after his daughter’s wedding in 1967, as he later reveals on a radio talk show, Billy is kidnapped by two-foot-high aliens who resemble upside-down toilet plungers, who he says are called Tralfamadorians. They take him in their flying saucer to the planet Tralfamadore, where they mate him with a movie actress named Montana Wildhack. She, like Billy, has been brought from Earth to live under a transparent geodesic dome in a zoo where Tralfamadorians can observe extraterrestrial curiosities. The Tralfamadorians explain to Billy their perception of time, how its entire sweep exists for them simultaneously in the fourth dimension. When someone dies, that person is simply dead at a particular time. Somewhere else and at a different time he or she is alive and well. Tralfamadorians prefer to look at life’s nicer moments.
When he returns to Earth, Billy initially says nothing of his experiences. In 1968, he gets on a chartered plane to go to an optometry conference in Montreal. The plane crashes into a mountain, and, among the optometrists, only Billy survives. A brain surgeon operates on him in a Vermont hospital. On her way to visit him there, Valencia dies of accidental carbon monoxide poisoning after crashing her car. Billy’s daughter places him under the care of a nurse back home in Ilium. But he feels that the time is ripe to tell the world what he has learned. Billy has foreseen this moment while time-tripping, and he knows that his message will eventually be accepted. He sneaks off to New York City, where he goes on a radio talk show. Shortly thereafter, he writes a letter to the local paper. His daughter is at her wit’s end and does not know what to do with him. Billy makes a tape recording of his account of his death, which he predicts will occur in 1976 after Chicago has been hydrogen-bombed by the Chinese. He knows exactly how it will happen: a vengeful man he knew in the war will hire someone to shoot him. Billy adds that he will experience the violet hum of death and then will skip back to some other point in his life. He has seen it all many times."
Member,"Frankie Addams is a young, confused twelve-year-old adolescent living in the American south in 1944. The book is framed around her main frustration with feeling like she belongs to no group, that she is disconnected with the world around her. The daughter of a jeweler and a mother who died in child birth, she is highly precocious and stubborn, but also naïve and unaware of the reasons for her own emotions. She spends the main action of the book, which begins on the last Friday in August and ends two days later, obsessed with her brother Jarvis's wedding on Sunday to Janice Evans.
As the story begins, she expresses her fears, anxiety and confusion about marriage to her housekeeper, Berenice and her six-year-old cousin, John Henry. Berenice passes off her feelings as masked jealousy. Frankie later asks John Henry to sleep over, claiming he looks scared. However, as we know, Frankie is really the one who feels that way. She is relieved to have a person to sleep next to, since she used to sleep next to her father, until he recently said she was too old.
In the first part of the novella, the narrator describes the following Saturday morning, but then skips right to the early evening of that day. Only in the second part does McCullers return to Saturday afternoon to describe the events that took place. Before then, we are given a lot of character background about Frankie. We hear about her various attempts to become more worldly, to pay attention to things like the fact that World War II rages all around her. Through her various brushes with sexual experiences, we discover how completely unaware of the facts of life she is. Eventually, Frankie has a revelation that she belongs to her brother and his future wife, saying, ""They are the we of me.""

When the narration returns back to Saturday afternoon, we find that Frankie has changed her name to F. Jasmine in an attempt to both sound more grown up and to have a name which begins in J A, just like Janice and Jarvis. She tours the town telling people of her plans to run away with the newly-weds the following evening. She expects everyone to notice the sudden change in her and that she has shed her childhood persona. However, her father takes no notice and treats her as the same little girl. When she stops in his jewelry shop, he tells her that Uncle Charles has died and she tries to react in a mature manner. Walking down the street again, she encounters a Soldier and has a stilted conversation with him at a local bar, eventually agreeing to have a proper date with him later that evening.
Returning home, she sits down to eat a lengthy dinner with Berenice and John Henry. The three of them launch into a frank and heart felt conversation about love. Berenice tells of her four marriages and cautions F. Jasmine not to be delusional about her prospects of joining up with Janice and Jarvis after the wedding. They discuss what they would do were they God and could change the world to their liking. John Henry imagines a world make of good things to eat. Berenice sees a place where there is no distinction between black and white. F. Jasmine imagines that boys could change into girls and vice versa, at will. Eventually, F. Jasmine and Berenice come to a poignant understanding of the societal pitfalls of race differences.
F. Jasmine leaves the house Saturday evening and travels to Big Mama's house to have her fortune told. She learns that she will indeed take a journey the next day, but that she will eventually return. Discouraged, F. Jasmine goes to meet the soldier at the bar. They sit down for a drink and eventually he coerces her to return to his hotel room where he attempts to have sex with her. She hits him over the head with a pitcher and flees back to her house.
The wedding turns out to be a bust for the newly dubbed ""Frances."" She pleads to run off with Janice and Jarvis, entirely in vain. Dejected and depressed, she returns home with her hopes dashed. She attempts to run away, stealing her father's pistol, but she is quickly found by the police and returned home.
In a speedy denouement, McCullers describes the next three months. In that time, much changes for Frances. She finds a new friend, Mary Littlejohn. She and her father get ready to move. Berenice decides to quit and get married again. John Henry dies of meningitis."
Framed,"Lawyer Bryan Stevenson gives a first-person account of his decades helping marginalized Americans who have been unfairly and harshly punished by the U.S. criminal justice system, which disproportionately targets people of color and poor people. At the heart of Just Mercy is the story of Walter McMillian, a Black man who was framed for the murder of a girl named Ronda Morrison, convicted, and sent to death row. 
Stevenson alternates chapters about Walter with his personal reflections on our country’s history with racial disparity and issues around incarceration. Stevenson highlights other groups of vulnerable people who have been victimized by the criminal justice system and shares the stories of the prisoners he has helped over the years. The book also follows the growth of Stevenson’s nonprofit law project, the Alabama-based Equal Justice Initiative (EJI), through its expansion from focusing on death row prisoners to helping people sentenced to life without parole. Stevenson chronicles how EJI becomes a significant force in criminal justice reform.
In 1983 as a law student, Stevenson discovers his life’s passion when he interns with the Georgia-based Southern Prisoners Defense Committee and meets his first death row prisoner. After graduation Stevenson accepts a job with the organization to represent poor prisoners, including those in Alabama who lack any public defender. He meets Walter McMillian on Alabama’s death row. Walter owns a successful business but also transgresses racial boundaries when he has an affair with a white woman. Soon after the affair becomes public, the woman’s friend, Ralph Myers, accuses Walter of committing the unsolved murder of Ronda Morrison, which has outraged the community. Law enforcement, including a racist sheriff and the district attorney, eagerly pounces on this accusation, overlooking Walter’s alibi and a lack of evidence. Instead, they actively force Ralph to stick with his story even when he tries to recant. They coerce other false witness testimonies, and—as revealed years later—actively suppress evidence.
After Stevenson and the team at EJI unsuccessfully appeal Walter’s conviction, they launch their own investigation of the crime and uncover new evidence. They find witnesses who can prove the witnesses against Walter lied as well as financial records that indicate that one of these witnesses was paid to give false testimony. Stevenson and his team also petition for and receive all records from Walter’s trial. However, their big break comes when they receive a phone call from Ralph, who now wants to make amends. Ralph admits to lying about Walter and says he was threatened by law enforcement. Stevenson wins a hearing for Walter where he can present his new evidence: Ralph’s testimony, which is confirmed by health care workers and other inmates, as well as recordings of the law enforcement team threatening Ralph if he doesn’t frame Walter. 
While the judge refuses to grant Walter relief, Stevenson continues the appeal process through the Alabama courts. The district attorney asks outside agents to investigate the murder for which Walter was convicted, and the investigators determine that Walter had nothing to do with the crime. Six weeks later, the court invalidates Walter’s conviction. Stevenson and the State file a joint motion to dismiss the charges, and Walter is set free.
Throughout the process, Stevenson and Walter become close friends, and Stevenson helps Walter upon his release, including filing a civil suit on his behalf and offering him a place to stay. Walter works with Stevenson to share his story, giving interviews and speaking at legal conferences, and Walter is even featured in a documentary. Unfortunately, Walter is diagnosed with advancing dementia and is forced to rely on family and eventually a nursing facility for his care. He dies in 2013. Stevenson gives a eulogy at his funeral and shares all he learned from Walter, particularly that we must extend mercy to everyone, even those who have not earned it.
Interspersed with chapters chronicling Walter’s narrative are stories of Stevenson’s other clients and work. His closeness with these prisoners and their horrifying circumstances makes Stevenson more determined to help and causes him to reflect on abstract issues that nevertheless imbue the criminal justice system, like humanity and mercy. Stevenson focuses on several categories of vulnerable people who become trapped in the system, including mentally ill prisoners, disabled prisoners, and poor women who give birth to stillborn babies. 
Stevenson and his team at EJI also become increasingly focused on juvenile offenders who are sometimes tried as adults despite their young age. These offenders may be given de facto death sentences by being sentenced to life without parole and face perilous circumstances when they are housed in adult prisons. Stevenson illustrates how these prisoners retain their own humanity while being forced to live under inhumane conditions. He also discusses some of the qualities common among these types of prisoners: They are generally poor and disproportionately people of color, and most of them lack adequate legal counsel. The juveniles have horrific backgrounds of abuse and neglect.
Stevenson and his team at EJI also work to change the legal system to offer more protection to marginalized people. Several of his cases end up before the U.S. Supreme Court, and he succeeds in winning rulings that ban as unconstitutional the conviction of children to life without parole and the execution of people deemed incompetent from dementia or neurological disease. EJI works to raise public awareness of issues surrounding unfair incarceration, produces groundbreaking reports on racial issues, and sets up programs to help formerly incarcerated people adjust to life on the outside.
Stevenson also reflects on the issues that surround the criminal justice system. His time spent with prisoners awaiting their execution makes him realize how inhumane it is to prepare another human to die. After decades of work, when Stevenson fails to prevent the execution of a man who suffers from an intellectual disability, he momentarily feels unable to continue his work. However, he realizes that he cannot help but be broken by his experiences and comes to understand that it is his own brokenness that allows him to more fully understand the need for mercy and to bring compassion to others. The book ends with Stevenson’s renewed commitment to helping others."
Schools,"Marjane “Marji” Satrapi is an intelligent, spirited, and very modern girl living with her parents in Iran’s capital of Tehran during the eventful period of Iranian history from the late 1970s into the early 1980s. In Persepolis: The Story of a Childhood, Marji’s remembers her life during those years, mostly from when she was about ten to age fourteen. This account includes how Marji and her family lived through and were affected by turbulent events that included the overthrow of the autocratic Shah of Iran by the Islamic revolution, the oppressive fundamentalist regime that replaced the Shah, and the devasting Iran-Iraq war.
The nation’s wealth has long made it a target of outside invaders, but Islamic revolution of 1979 has pushed out the Western-backed government of the Shah.  The revolution has ushered in a new Islamic regime that is bringing massive societal changes impacting how people are supposed to behave--including Marji and her family. Marji struggles to adjust to the changes at her liberal French bilingual school, which has become increasingly stricter. Girls are required to wear veils and female and male students are now separated. Marji’s wealthy and modern parents—her father, Ebi, and her mother, Taji—take part in the massive protests against the new regime’s strict rules on behavior (just as they had previously protested against the Shah’s regime). Marji’s parents worry when a photo of Marji’s mother a protest appears in newspapers magazines. Later, after a demonstration they are at turns violent, the Satrapis decide that openly protesting is too dangerous to continue to do.
Marji feels conflict between her own deeply spiritual feelings and the stark modernism of her parents. She talks to God at night and has believed she will become a prophet one day since she was six years old, Marji. But the revolution leads to Marji setting aside these ambitions while she studies and imitates protestors and revolutionaries. She mimics protestors in the garden of her house and studies books about famous revolutionaries and philosophers given to her by her parents. She fantasizes about becoming a hero and wants her parents to become heroes too. Marji’s relationship with God becomes strained, as she finds that she and God have less to talk about—although God does still come by to see her from time to time.
Marji thrills when she learns that rebels fill her family history. She learns that her grandfather was a prince and later a communist whom the Shah removed from power and that her uncle Anoosh, also a communist, spent nine years in prison during the Shah’s regime. Marji spends a short time with Anoosh, learning about his life. After the Shah fell from power in 1979, Anoosh was released from prison, but when Islamic fundamentalists consolidate their grip on power, they hunt Anoosh down, imprison him, and later execute him. Her new idol killed, Marji feels crushed. She completely abandons her faith in God and increasingly questions the pro-regime propaganda she hears—especially at school.
Marji deeply loves and identifies with of her parents, even if she does sometimes feel that their actions and behavior (as wealthy and privileged individuals) do not always live up to their pro-democratic and liberal rhetoric. Marji also has a special connection with her grandmother, who remains stoic and inspiring to Marji in spite of the turmoil and numerous tragedies stemming from political actions that impact her and the family. Marji’s uncle Anoosh is not Marji’s only direct experience with the cruel consequences of the government’s actions. Throughout the book, death and devastation occurs among Marji’s extended family and friends as direct results of the brutality and fanaticism of the Iranian regimes and the war with Iraq.
People had rejoiced when the Shah was forced out, but as Islamic fundamentalists retain power, Marji and her family watch as their neighbors’ behavior shifts back and forth to coincide with the current political winds. The neighbors go from wearing short skirts and drinking alcohol to covering themselves and denouncing the use of alcohol. Marji’s parents ask her to tell everyone that she prays every day, a lie they hope will keep Marji safe, but acknowledge that the rules seem foolish. Marji grows more rebellious, as she increasingly views the rules at school and elsewhere as hypocritical and difficult to follow. Armed with more knowledge and personal experience, Marji begins to act out in ways that put her safety at risk. In fact, she even (accidentally) hits her principal during an argument, which results in her expulsion from school. Fearing her rebellious behavior will get her killed, Marji’s mother tries to reason with Marji by telling her that it is not her responsibility to serve justice and that the bad guys eventually pay for their sins in the end.
The war with Iraq had originally inspired Marji to vocal patriotism in protection her country against another invasion, but Marji begins to realize there are greater forces behind the war. She sees how the Islamic regime needs the war to continue survive and keep power. The war promotes a sense of nationalism and pride in the public, and those who die in the war are hailed as “martyrs.” Marji sees thousands of poor boys lured into war without proper training. She becomes increasingly uncomfortable and aware of class differences within society. Poor young boys are lured into the army with gold-painted keys to the “kingdom of heaven” to help them enter paradise after dying on the battlefield, while children in her wealthy neighborhood are left alone.
More and more people try to escape Iran as the borders tighten and Iraqi forces bomb Tehran and other Iranian cities. Realizing that Marji’s chances of escaping Iran are narrowing, her parents make the difficult decision to send her abroad alone to finish school in Vienna, explaining that only a good education will free her of Iran. Marji feels heartbroken. She spends one last night with her grandmother, who gives her warm advice and inspires her to be compassionate and understanding while in Vienna. Marji gives away all of her prized contraband to her friends, including a Kim Wilde poster. At the airport, as Marji turns to say goodbye to her parents one last time to see that her mother, devasted by her only child’s departure, has fainted."
Document,"In Common Sense, Thomas Paine argues for American independence. His argument begins with more general, theoretical reflections about government and religion, then progresses onto the specifics of the colonial situation.
Paine begins by distinguishing between government and society. Society, according to Paine, is everything constructive and good that people join together to accomplish. Government, on the other hand, is an institution whose sole purpose is to protect us from our own vices. Government has its origins in the evil of man and is therefore a necessary evil at best. Paine says that government's sole purpose is to protect life, liberty and property, and that a government should be judged solely on the basis of the extent to which it accomplishes this goal.
Paine then considers an imagined scenario in which a small group of people has been placed on an island, and cut off from the rest of society. In time, these people develop ties with one another, and lawmaking becomes inevitable. Paine says the people will be much happier if they are responsible for the creation of the laws that rule them. Paine is also implicitly arguing that such a system of representation is also better for the American colonists. Having expressed his disagreement with British reign in America, Paine proceeds to launch a general attack on the British system of government. Paine says the British system is too complex and rife with contradictions, and that the monarchy is granted far too much power. The British system pretends to offer a reasonable system of checks and balances, but in fact, it does not.
From here Paine moves on to discuss, in general, the notions of monarchy and hereditary succession. Man, Pain argues, was born into a state of equality, and the distinction that has arisen between king and subject is an unnatural one. At first, Paine says, the world was without kings, but the ancient Jews decided they wanted a king. This angered God, but he allowed them to have one. Paine presents pages of biblical evidence detailing God's wrath at the idea of the Jews having a king. The conclusion Paine reaches is that the practice of monarchy originates from sin, and is an institution that the Bible and God condemn. Paine calls hereditary succession an abominable practice. He says that even if people were to choose to have a king, that does not legitimize that King's child acting as a future ruler. Furthermore, hereditary succession has brought with it innumerable evils, such as incompetent kings, corruption, and civil war.
Having dispensed with the preliminary theoretical issues, Paine sets in to discuss the details of the American situation. In response to the argument that America has flourished under British rule, and therefore ought to stay under the king, Paine says that such an argument fails to realize that America has evolved and no longer needs Britain's help. Some say that Britain has protected America, and therefore deserves allegiance, but Paine responds that Britain has only watched over America in order to secure its own economic well-being. Paine adds that most recently, instead of watching over the colonies, the British have been attacking them, and are therefore undeserving of American loyalty.
Paine says that the colonies have little to gain from remaining attached to Britain. Commerce can be better conducted with the rest of Europe, but only after America becomes independent. Paine also asserts that if the colonies remain attached to Britain, the same problems that have arisen in the past will arise in the future. Paine argues that it is necessary to seek independence now, as to do otherwise would only briefly cover up problems that will surely reemerge.
Paine even proposes the form of government that the independent colonies should adopt. His recommendation is for a representative democracy that gives roughly equal weight to each of the colonies.
Paine explains why the current time is a good time to break free of Britain. Primarily, Paine focuses on the present size of the colonies, and on their current capabilities. He presents an inventory of the British Navy and gives calculations revealing how America could build a navy of comparable size. Paine recommends this as a way of ensuring America's security and prosperity in trade. Paine also argues that America is sufficiently small as to be united now. If time were to elapse, and the population of the colonies to grow, the same feeling of unity would not be present. Paine adds that if the Americans revolt now, they can use the vast expanses of uncharted land to the West in order to pay down some of the debt they will incur.
Paine says that as a colony of Britain, America lacks respectability on the international scene. They are seen simply as rebels, and cannot form substantial alliances with other nations. In order to prosper in the long term, the colonies need to be independent. Paine says that, by declaring independence, America will be able to ask for the help of other countries in its struggle for freedom. For all of these reasons, Paine says it is imperative and urgent that the colonies declare independence."
Regards,"The Bottom is a mostly Black community in Ohio, situated in the hills above the mostly white, wealthier community of Medallion. The Bottom first became a community when a master gave it to his former slave. This ""gift"" was in fact a trick: the master gave the former slave a poor stretch of hilly land, convincing the slave the land was worthwhile by claiming that because it was hilly, it was closer to heaven. The trick, though, led to the growth of a vibrant community. Now the community faces a new threat; wealthy whites have taken a liking to the land, and would like to destroy much of the town in order to build a golf course.
Shadrack, a resident of the Bottom, fought in WWI. He returns a shattered man, unable to accept the complexities of the world; he lives on the outskirts of town, attempting to create order in his life. One of his methods involves compartmentalizing his fear of death in a ritual he invents and names National Suicide Day. The town is at first wary of him and his ritual, then, over time, unthinkingly accepts him.
Meanwhile, the families of the children Nel and Sula are contrasted. Nel is the product of a family that believes deeply in social conventions; hers is a stable home, though some might characterize it as rigid. Nel is uncertain of the conventional life her mother, Helene, wants for her; these doubts are hammered home when she meets Rochelle, her grandmother and a former prostitute, the only unconventional woman in her family line. Sula's family is very different: she lives with her grandmother, Eva, and her mother, Hannah, both of whom are seen by the town as eccentric and loose. Their house also serves as a home for three informally adopted boys and a steady stream of borders.
Despite their differences, Sula and Nel become fiercely attached to each other during adolescence. However, a traumatic accident changes everything. One day, Sula playfully swings a neighborhood boy, Chicken Little, around by his hands. When she loses her grip, the boy falls into a nearby river and drowns. They never tell anyone about the accident even though they did not intend to harm the boy. The two girls begin to grow apart. One day, in an accident, Sula's mother's dress catches fire and she dies of the burns.
After high school, Nel chooses to marry and settles into the conventional role of wife and mother. Sula follows a wildly divergent path and lives a life of fierce independence and total disregard for social conventions. Shortly after Nel's wedding, Sula leaves the Bottom for a period of 10 years. She has many affairs, some with white men. However, she finds people following the same boring routines elsewhere, so she returns to the Bottom and to Nel.
Upon her return, the town regards Sula as the very personification of evil for her blatant disregard of social conventions. Their hatred in part rests upon Sula's interracial relationships, but is crystallized when Sula has an affair with Nel's husband, Jude, who subsequently abandons Nel. Ironically, the community's labeling of Sula as evil actually improves their own lives. Her presence in the community gives them the impetus to live harmoniously with one another. Nel breaks off her friendship with Sula. Just before Sula dies in 1940, they achieve a half-hearted reconciliation. With Sula's death, the harmony that had reigned in the town quickly dissolves.
In 1965, with the Bottom facing the prospect of the white golf course, Nel visits Eva in the nursing home. Eva accuses her of sharing the guilt for Chicken Little's death. Her accusation forces Nel to confront the unfairness of her judgment against Sula. Nel admits to herself that she had blamed his death entirely on Sula and set herself up as the ""good"" half of the relationship. Nel comes to realize that in the aftermath of Chicken Little's death she had too quickly clung to social convention in an effort to define herself as ""good."" Nel goes to the cemetery and mourns at Sula's grave, calling out Sula's name in sadness.
Sula is a novel about ambiguity. It questions and examines the terms ""good"" and ""evil,"" often demonstrating that the two often resemble one another. The novel addresses the confusing mysteries of human emotions and relationships, ultimately concluding that social conventions are inadequate as a foundation for living one's life. The novel tempts the reader to apply the diametrically opposed terms of ""good and evil,"" ""right and wrong"" to the characters and their actions, and yet simultaneously shows why it is necessary to resist such temptation. While exploring the ways in which people try to make meaning of lives filled with conflicts over race, gender, and simple idiosyncratic points of views, Sula resists easy answers, demonstrating the ambiguity, beauty, and terror of life, in both its triumphs and horrors."
Xand,"Between the World and Me is a letter written in three parts. Coates writes directly to his son Samori. Coates is forty years old, and Samori is fifteen. The text is not set up as a traditional narrative. Rather, it traces Coates’ thoughts and feelings throughout his life so far. It is loosely chronological though sometimes interrupted with anecdotes out of chronological order. The plot has less to do with specific events and more to do with the way Coates’ thoughts and opinions change over time.
Part I begins in the present, as a host for a news show interviews Coates. She asks Coates what it means to lose his body, and he answers her with all the knowledge he has gained over the years. Coates turns to his childhood, describing his life and family as he was growing up in the ghettos of West Baltimore. He first understands the gap between his Black world and the suburban white world in childhood, though he cannot articulate the reasons for the separation. Coates begins to give form to his thoughts by reading the many books on Africana that his father owns. He develops a belief system similar to that of Malcolm X and disagrees with the idea of non-violent protests.
Coates attends Howard University, and he evolves his beliefs significantly during this time. He constantly studies, reads, and questions everything. He turns to Chancellor Williams’ The Destruction of Black Civilization as his main guidebook. He begins to think of Black people as “kings in exile,” severed from their nation by plundering Europeans, and keeps a mental trophy case of African heroes. Debating with older poets and his teachers challenges his views, which leads Coates to journalism. He starts to think about Black history more objectively and less romantically. At Howard, he meets Kenyatta Matthews, and she becomes pregnant at twenty-four. He leaves Howard without a degree and moves with Kenyatta to Delaware, where he works as a freelance writer.
The main event in Part II is the police murder of Prince Jones, whom Coates met at Howard. This is an episode of police brutality in which the officer is not charged. Coates begins to write about Jones’ murder and develops a rage at both the police and all of white America. Coates’ family moves to New York City in 2001, and Coates finds himself unable to sympathize with the victims of the September 11 terrorist attack because he views them all as part of the system that brought down Prince Jones. Coates describes his life in Brooklyn as a new father with young Samori. His thoughts revolve around Samori understanding the weight and struggle he will have to go through as a Black man. The second main event of Part II is a trip to France. Travel opens Coates’ eyes to worlds outside of America. He realizes how much fear has damaged his life, and is able to better place himself in the larger context of the world as a whole.
In Part III, Coates visits Prince Jones’ mother, Dr. Mable Jones. He is amazed by her composure and compares it to the steady determination of his grandmother and the protestors at sit-ins in the 1960s. Dr. Jones speaks about her own history and tells Coates more about Prince. After leaving, Coates sits in his car and rethinks his views of non-violent protestors. He used to think they were shameful not to fight for themselves, but he now believes they may have known that there was never any security to fight for in the first place. He reflects on attending Howard University’s homecoming and the sense of Black power he felt within that group of people. His parting message to his son is to remind Samori to engage fully in the struggle of his life as a Black person, but to know he is not responsible for converting white people to the struggle. Coates is confident that white America will continue to plunder not only Black bodies but the environment, too. The text thus begins and ends discussing the white assault against the Black body."
Plagues,"The Plague is a novel about a plague epidemic in the large Algerian city of Oran. In April, thousands of rats stagger into the open and die. When a mild hysteria grips the population, the newspapers begin clamoring for action. The authorities finally arrange for the daily collection and cremation of the rats. Soon thereafter, M. Michel, the concierge for the building where Dr. Rieux works, dies after falling ill with a strange fever. When a cluster of similar cases appears, Dr. Rieux's colleague, Castel, becomes certain that the illness is the bubonic plague. He and Dr. Rieux are forced to confront the indifference and denial of the authorities and other doctors in their attempts to urge quick, decisive action. Only after it becomes impossible to deny that a serious epidemic is ravaging Oran, do the authorities enact strict sanitation measures, placing the whole city under quarantine.
The public reacts to their sudden imprisonment with intense longing for absent loved ones. They indulge in selfish personal distress, convinced that their pain is unique in comparison to common suffering. Father Paneloux delivers a stern sermon, declaring that the plague is God's punishment for Oran's sins. Raymond Rambert endeavors to escape Oran to rejoin his wife in Paris, but the city's bureaucrats refuse to let him leave. He tries to escape by illegal means with the help of Cottard's criminal associates. Meanwhile, Rieux, Tarrou, and Grand doggedly battle the death and suffering wrought by the plague. Rambert finalizes his escape plan, but, after Tarrou tells him that Rieux is likewise separated from his wife, Rambert is ashamed to flee. He chooses to stay behind and help fight the epidemic. Cottard committed a crime (which he does not name) in the past, so he has lived in constant fear of arrest and punishment. He greets the plague epidemic with open arms because he no longer feels alone in his fearful suffering. He accumulates a great deal of wealth as a smuggler during the epidemic.
After the term of exile lasts several months, many of Oran's citizens lose their selfish obsession with personal suffering. They come to recognize the plague as a collective disaster that is everyone's concern. They confront their social responsibility and join the anti-plague efforts. When M. Othon's small son suffers a prolonged, excruciating death from the plague, Dr. Rieux shouts at Paneloux that he was an innocent victim. Paneloux, deeply shaken by the boy's death, delivers a second sermon that modifies the first. He declares that the inexplicable deaths of innocents force the Christian to choose between believing everything and believing nothing about God. When he falls ill, he refuses to consult a doctor, leaving his fate entirely in the hands of divine Providence. He dies clutching his crucifix, but the symptoms of his illness do not match those of the plague. Dr. Rieux records him as a ""doubtful case.""
When the epidemic ends, Cottard cannot cope. He begins randomly firing his gun into the street until he is captured by the police. Grand, having recovered from a bout of plague, vows to make a fresh start in life. Tarrou dies just as the epidemic is waning, but he battles with all his strength for his life, just as he helped Rieux battle for the lives of others. Rambert's wife joins him in Oran after the city gates are finally opened, but Dr. Rieux's own wife dies of a prolonged illness before she and her husband can be reunited. The public quickly returns to its old routine, but Rieux knows that the battle against the plague is never over because the bacillus microbe can lie dormant for years. The Plague is his chronicle of the scene of human suffering that all too many people are willing to forget."
Please,"When the novel opens, Lily Bloom sits on the roof of a building in Boston, looking out at the city and the stars, thinking about death. She’s just come from her father’s funeral. She’s reflecting on how much she resents her father for abusing her mother when a man joins her on the roof and starts angrily kicking a patio chair. The man, Ryle Kincaid, is a neurosurgeon, and the two begin to flirt and tell each other increasingly intimate “naked truths.” Ryle reveals that he lost a child patient because the child’s brother shot him accidentally. Lily tells Ryle that she gave the eulogy at her abusive father’s funeral and couldn’t think of anything nice to say, so she stood there for two minutes in purposeful silence. Lily also tells Ryle she lost her virginity to a homeless boy named Atlas. Ryle tells Lily he wants to sleep with her, but he only has one-night stands and never wants to get married or have children. Though Lily is interested in Ryle, she can’t imagine having sex without it leading to a relationship. 
Six months later, Lily uses her inheritance to buy a storefront to convert into a flower shop. A woman named Allysa offers to work for Lily, and the two become fast friends. Lily and Allysa are cleaning up the storefront when Lily falls and hurts her ankle. Allysa calls her husband Marshall and her brother for help. When Allysa’s brother arrives, Lily sees that it’s Ryle. They pretend not to know each other for Allysa’s sake, but Ryle tells Lily that he still wants to sleep with her. They decide they need to stay away from each other because they want different things. As Lily recovers from her sprained ankle for a week, she reads her teenage journals, which were written as letters addressed to Ellen DeGeneres. They tell the story of Atlas and Lily. 
As a teenager, Lily notices a boy is living in an abandoned house behind hers. She feels for Atlas and begins to leave him food, lend him her father’s clothes, and let him shower at her house. The two become closer and begin to fall in love, and Atlas becomes a confidant and protector for Lily when her father hurts her and her mother. The two watch Ellen and Finding Nemo together and tell each other to “just keep swimming” when times get tough, quoting a line from the movie. Atlas learns a family member can take him in in Boston, and though Lily dreads it, Atlas moves away to find more stability. She’s heartbroken, but he returns on her 16th birthday. He gives her a magnet that says that everything is better in Boston. They make love for the first time. Atlas promises to come for Lily when he feels that his life is good enough for her. Then Lily’s father walks in on them. He savagely beats Atlas with a baseball bat. Atlas is taken away in an ambulance. This is the last time Lily sees Atlas, and throughout her life, she wonders why Atlas never came back for her.
Back in the present, Ryle pursues Lily, and after trying to get her to have sex with him, he admits he has feelings for her. Lily insists they not have sex and try dating, since she doesn’t trust him to have a relationship with her. They quickly start falling for each other. After they have been dating for a bit, Ryle invites himself to dinner with Lily and her mom. At dinner, Lily sees Atlas working at the restaurant. She’s shocked. During a brief conversation, Atlas tells Lily he has a girlfriend but that he wishes they had run into each other a year ago. Lily doesn’t tell Ryle that she ran into Atlas and tries to avoid going back to the restaurant again. One night, when Ryle and Lily are hanging out, Ryle burns himself on a casserole dish he tries to take out of the oven without a mitt. When Lily laughs, Ryle pushes her, and she hits her head. She’s bleeding, and she feels horrified and heartbroken, immediately worrying she’s turned into her mother. He’s quickly apologetic and eventually she forgives him, saying that if anything violent happens again, she’ll leave him.
They go to dinner with Allysa and Marshall at the same restaurant where Atlas works to celebrate that Allysa and Marshall are going to have a baby. Atlas comes to the table and the waiter introduces him as the chef. Atlas notices that both Lily and Ryle are injured and intuits that Ryle hurt her. When they are alone, Atlas tells Lily to leave Ryle. When she refuses, he says she’s like her mother. Ryle sees them together, and he learns that the chef is Atlas, the boy from Lily’s past. It comes to blows and Atlas throws Ryle out of his restaurant. Lily assures Ryle that nothing is going on between her and Atlas. They enjoy a period of peace and decide to get married in Vegas. But Ryle’s jealousy continues to simmer. When Ryle discovers that Atlas has given Lily his phone number, he flies into a jealous rage and pushes Lily down the stairs. She’s badly injured. When Allysa finds out what happened, she insists Ryle tell Lily about his past. He confesses that, just like the young patient he lost the night they met, his brother died of a gunshot wound because Ryle accidentally shot him. He marks this as the origin of his rage. Lily forgives him, and they try to be together again.
Allysa and Marshall have a baby and name her after Ryle. The night Rylee is born, Lily comes home to find Ryle in a strange mood. He makes her read an article in the newspaper in which Atlas mentions a woman who is special to him and says that the name of his restaurant (Bib’s) means “Better in Boston.” Ryle has the magnet in his hand and has read all of Lily’s teenage journals. He attempts to rape Lily and headbutts her so hard she blacks out. She calls Atlas to come get her, and he takes her to the hospital, where she discovers she’s pregnant. She takes her time figuring out what she wants for her life, confused by her emotions for Atlas and by all her conflicting feelings of rage and love and hurt for Ryle. She gradually lets Ryle back into her life in a platonic way, telling him about the baby, though she’s unsure what she wants from him. 
When the baby is born, Lily and Ryle name her Emerson, after Ryle’s brother. Lily says she wants a divorce because she would never want her daughter to endure what she and her mother did. Ryle agrees, though he is heartbroken about it. They share custody of Emerson. One day, Lily runs into Atlas. He says his life is good enough for Lily now, so if she’s ever ready to fall in love again, he’s there for her. She says she’s ready, and they embrace. He says she can stop swimming."
Halfway,"Speak, by Laurie Halse Anderson, chronicles the struggles of thirteen-year-old Melinda Sordino after she is a raped by at a party the summer before her freshman year of high school by another student. Melinda tells her story in first person narrative. She describes events within the framework of the four marking periods of the school year.
In the opening part of Speak, “First Marking Period,” Melinda begins high school, and we learn that former friends now hate her. She experiences humiliation in the cafeteria and Mr. Neck, a social studies teacher, further embarrasses her by giving her demerits on the first day of school. Ostracized by her former friends, she befriends Heather, a new girl at the school. Heather seeks popularity, and she badgers Melinda to join various clubs. Rachel, Melinda’s ex-best friend, hasn’t tried to find out the truth about what really happened to Melinda that night at the party over the summer.
Melinda describes her classes, activities, and thoughts. Her project in Mr. Freeman’s art class is to create a work of art based on a “tree,” which is the object named on the piece of paper she randomly chooses. In biology, Melinda thinks that David Petrakis, her lab partner, might be cute without the braces. And in algebra, when Mr. Stetman has Rachel come to the board to help Melinda with a problem, Melinda is humiliated. 
Melinda often skips class using stolen late passes and doesn’t complete her homework. She finds refuge at school in a vacant janitor’s closet, which she turns into her “burrow.” At the Homecoming Rally, students bully her for being the one who called the cops that night at the party.
At home, Melinda and her parents communicate with each other by leaving notes on the refrigerator. In her bedroom, she no longer wants to look in the mirror and puts it in the back of her closet. Toward the end of the marking period, Melinda’s parents hear from the school about her missing work, and she remains silent while they berate her for failing. Through it all, Melinda sees “IT” everywhere, the nightmare from which she cannot awaken.
In “Second Marking Period,” school is a grind for Melinda. At her parents’ insistence, she stays after to finish her homework, but she goes to her burrow and naps instead. In social studies, David Petrakis stands up against Mr. Neck’s racist rant about immigration. In biology, she finds that a seed within the apple she has cut is already growing. Heather gives her an early Christmas present, and Melinda decides she’ll give Heather a friendship necklace. 
On Christmas, Melinda nearly tells her parents what happened that night last summer but can’t. Winter break is miserable. Her parents keep her busy working for them, and she is relieved when school starts again. 
In gym class, Melinda impresses the basketball coaches with skills but has no interest in being on the team. She reluctantly helps Heather in her attempts to become an initiated member of a do-good club. And in biology, when she and David dissect a frog, she faints when preparing to slice it open. 
Melinda’s parents receive another call from the guidance counselor about her grades. After their verbal assault, Melinda goes to her room and uses an open paper clip to scrape at her wrist. 
“IT”, who we learn is Andy Evans, harasses Melinda in the cafeteria, and she runs to the bathroom to vomit. She has yet to tell anyone, even the reader, about what happened that summer night.
In “Third Marking Period,” Melinda continues to skip school and avoid Andy Evans. Heather ends their friendship suddenly, and later returns the friendship necklace Melinda had given her for Christmas. No one, Melinda is sure, “would like the inside girl I think I am.” 
The school counselors hold another meeting with Melinda’s parents, who berate and threaten her. She refuses to talk or defend herself. She receives In-School Suspension, and IT is there. He sits next to her and blows in her ear when Mr. Neck isn’t looking. 
In art class, Mr. Freeman gives Melinda a book about Picasso to help her “paralyzed” imagination. Picasso’s art inspires her, and she begins to draw. Mr. Freeman recognizes that she has a lot to say.
Melinda works to meet the expectations set for her. Yet, with “no friends in the known universe,” Melinda sits alone at lunch, wondering if everyone is talking and laughing about her. 
One afternoon, after a basketball game, David Petrakis invites her to his house for pizza to celebrate the team’s one-point win. She declines, torn between getting a life, and the fact that the world is a dangerous place.
At last, Melinda reveals that she was attacked at a party last summer, though she does not use the word “rape.” At this point, we (the readers) are the only ones besides Melinda who know what happened.
In “Fourth Marking Period,” Melinda takes her ex-friend Ivy’s advice and tries drawing a tree instead of carving one from linoleum block. She also learns that Rachel is dating Andy Evans. Compelled to do something, she writes a note to Rachel warning her about Andy. In the note, she admits for the first time (but without divulging her identity), that she was raped. 
Springtime arrives, and Melinda finds solace working in the garden. She and David plan a protest in social studies class over an oral report she is supposed to present, and she stands up to Heather by refusing to help her decorate for the Senior Prom. She writes on a stall in the bathroom, “Guys to Stay Away From: Andy Evans.” Andy Evans continues to bully her. 
Melinda feels compelled to tell Rachel the truth about Andy and what happened that night. But, when Rachel learns that Andy Evans was Melinda’s attacker, she accuses Melinda of being jealous and calls her a “twisted little freak.” Later, Ivy brings Melinda into the bathroom stall. Other girls have added words like “creep” and “bastard” under Andy Evan’s name. Seeing that, Melinda feels like she can fly.
Melinda realizes she doesn’t need her burrow anymore. When she is clearing her items out of the closet, Andy Evans barges in, attacks Melinda, and tries to rape her again. She finds her voice and screams “NNNOOO!!” He does not back off, so Melinda breaks a mirror, takes a shard of glass, and holds it to his neck. “I said no,” she tells him. People who had heard her scream run for help.
With hours left in the school year, Melinda finds herself a sort of hero. She finishes her tree project, receiving an A+ from Mr. Freeman."
Union,"The Killer Angels tells the story of the Battle of Gettysburg. On July 1, 1863, the Army of Northern Virginia, or Confederate army, and the Army of the Potomac, or Union army, fought the largest battle of the American Civil War. When the battle ended, 51,000 men were dead, wounded, or missing. All the characters in the novel are based on real historical figures. They include General Robert E. Lee, commander of the Confederate army; General James Longstreet, Lee’s second in command; and Union Colonel Joshua L. Chamberlain, who participated in one of the most famous segments of the Battle of Gettysburg, the fighting on Little Round Top.
	The story begins on June 29, 1863. A spy comes to Longstreet and informs him that he has seen the Union army moving nearby. This information surprises Longstreet, because General J. E. B. Stuart is supposed to be tracking the Union army with his cavalry. Longstreet thinks the Confederate army must quickly move north to intercept the Union. The Confederates swing southeast through the mountains and toward a small town called Gettysburg.
	Miles south of Gettysburg, Union Colonel Joshua L. Chamberlain awakes to discover that his regiment, the Twentieth Maine, has a hundred new members—mutineers from the Second Maine. Chamberlain gives them a brief speech, asking them to continue to fight, and all but six of the men join the Twentieth Maine freely.
	In Gettysburg, General John Buford, leader of the Union cavalry, rides into the town and discovers Confederate troops nearby. He realizes that the two armies may end up fighting in the town, so he takes his two brigades—approximately 2,000 men—and positions the soldiers along the hills in the area. He knows that having high ground is the key to winning the battle, since it is easier to fight from above than below. In the Confederate camp, Longstreet meets with George Pickett and several other generals.
	On the morning of July 1, Lee rises and curses Stuart’s absence. He is blind without Stuart, because without him he has no idea where the Union army is. He meets with Longstreet, who wants to swing southeast and come between the Union army and Washington, D.C. Then, Longstreet says, the Confederates can use defensive tactics and have a much better chance of winning the battle. Lee refuses, because he wants to smash the Union army aggressively in one decisive stroke.
	Meanwhile, the battle begins at Gettysburg when the Confederates attack Buford’s men. Buford holds the Confederates off until infantry General John Reynolds arrives. Reynolds positions his troops and fights the Confederates off, but he is soon killed. Lee arrives in Gettysburg and finds the battle in full fury. Two other Confederate generals arrive and send word to Lee that they have engaged the Union troops, who continue to pour in from the south. Lee orders his generals to attack. Meanwhile, Chamberlain’s regiment begins to move northward toward Gettysburg.
	The first day’s battle ends with the Union forces retreating into the hills surrounding Gettysburg. There they dig in, setting up cannons and defensive stone walls. Longstreet is nervous—he knows that the hills are good defensive positions, and he knows that Lee plans to attack them rather than swing the army southeast toward Washington, D.C. Lee meets with his generals and is angry with General Ewell for not following his orders and taking Cemetery Hill and Culp’s Hill, thereby instead allowing the Union forces to retreat into them. Ewell is a cautious general, perhaps too cautious. Meanwhile, Buford returns to the Union camp to discover that he is being blamed for the day’s loss.
	On July 2, Chamberlain awakes and his regiment begins moving north again toward Gettysburg. On the way, his regiment discovers an escaped slave, and Chamberlain muses on the reasons behind the war and his thoughts on race. Back at Gettysburg, two of Lee’s generals—Ewell and Early—suggest that the army strike the Union’s two flanks in order to weaken it. Lee likes the plan, but Longstreet still wants to move southeast toward Washington, D.C. Lee refuses, and Longstreet reluctantly agrees to attack the Union’s left flank. As he leads his troops toward the hills to the south of Gettysburg, Little Round Top and Big Round Top, he discovers that the army has come down off the hills and into the peach orchard at the bottom. He decides he has no choice but to attack anyway, and a bloodbath on both sides is the result.
	Chamberlain’s regiment finally reaches Gettysburg and is placed on Little Round Top. Chamberlain is told that he is the extreme left of the Union line, which means he can never retreat. Chamberlain and his men hold the hill against numerous Confederate attacks, but eventually they run out of bullets. Chamberlain orders a bayonet charge, and his screaming regiment, charging down the hill, frightens the Confederates into fleeing. The Union still controls Little Round Top at the end of the day, and Longstreet’s men have suffered heavy losses in the peach orchard. That night, Stuart returns, and Lee scolds him for being absent. Lee then decides on a plan for the next day: now that he has battered the two flanks of the Union army, the middle must be weakened. He will charge through the middle of the Union line and split the army in two, then destroy each half individually.
	The next morning, July 3, Chamberlain’s men are moved to the center of the Union line, where it is supposed to be safe and quiet. At the Confederate camp, Longstreet tries to convince Lee one last time to swing the army toward Washington, D.C., but Lee again refuses. He is intent on attacking his enemy. Longstreet tells Lee that he is certain Lee’s plan is doomed to failure, but Lee obstinately refuses to budge. Longstreet reluctantly agrees to attack the center of the line and places Pickett in charge of the assault.
	The Confederates begin with an artillery barrage in an attempt to weaken the Union artillery on the other side. Chamberlain finds himself and his regiment in the middle of this bombardment, much to his surprise, but he survives intact. Since the Confederate artillery shoots too high, not much damage is dealt to the Union batteries. The Confederate attack begins as the troops start marching across the open field toward the Union troops. The Union begins firing cannons, blowing huge holes in the Confederate line and killing hundreds of men. When the Confederates come within range, the Union soldiers open fire with their guns, killing hundreds more. Pickett loses sixty percent of his division. The Confederates soon retreat, and the Battle of Gettysburg comes to its bloody, spectacular end."
Acquired,"Beloved begins in 1873 in Cincinnati, Ohio, where Sethe, a former slave, has been living with her eighteen-year-old daughter Denver. Sethe’s mother-in-law, Baby Suggs, lived with them until her death eight years earlier. Just before Baby Suggs’s death, Sethe’s two sons, Howard and Buglar, ran away. Sethe believes they fled because of the malevolent presence of an abusive ghost that has haunted their house at 124 Bluestone Road for years. Denver, however, likes the ghost, which everyone believes to be the spirit of her dead sister.
On the day the novel begins, Paul D, whom Sethe has not seen since they worked together on Mr. Garner’s Sweet Home plantation in Kentucky approximately twenty years earlier, stops by Sethe’s house. His presence resurrects memories that have lain buried in Sethe’s mind for almost two decades. From this point on, the story will unfold on two temporal planes. The present in Cincinnati constitutes one plane, while a series of events that took place around twenty years earlier, mostly in Kentucky, constitutes the other. This latter plane is accessed and described through the fragmented flashbacks of the major characters. Accordingly, we frequently read these flashbacks several times, sometimes from varying perspectives, with each successive narration of an event adding a little more information to the previous ones.
From these fragmented memories, the following story begins to emerge: Sethe, the protagonist, was born in the South to an African mother she never knew. When she is thirteen, she is sold to the Garners, who own Sweet Home and practice a comparatively benevolent kind of slavery. There, the other slaves, who are all men, lust after her but never touch her. Their names are Sixo, Paul D, Paul A, Paul F, and Halle. Sethe chooses to marry Halle, apparently in part because he has proven generous enough to buy his mother’s freedom by hiring himself out on the weekends. Together, Sethe and Halle have two sons, Howard and Buglar, as well as a baby daughter whose name we never learn. When she leaves Sweet Home, Sethe is also pregnant with a fourth child. After the eventual death of the proprietor, Mr. Garner, the widowed Mrs. Garner asks her sadistic, vehemently racist brother-in-law to help her run the farm. He is known to the slaves as schoolteacher, and his oppressive presence makes life on the plantation even more unbearable than it had been before. The slaves decide to run.
Schoolteacher and his nephews anticipate the slaves’ escape, however, and capture Paul D and Sixo. Schoolteacher kills Sixo and brings Paul D back to Sweet Home, where Paul D sees Sethe for what he believes will be the last time. She is still intent on running, having already sent her children ahead to her mother-in-law Baby Suggs’s house in Cincinnati. Invigorated by the recent capture, schoolteacher’s nephews seize Sethe in the barn and violate her, stealing the milk her body is storing for her infant daughter. Unbeknownst to Sethe, Halle is watching the event from a loft above her, where he lies frozen with horror. Afterward, Halle goes mad: Paul D sees him sitting by a churn with butter slathered all over his face. Paul D, meanwhile, is forced to suffer the indignity of wearing an iron bit in his mouth.
When schoolteacher finds out that Sethe has reported his and his nephews’ misdeeds to Mrs. Garner, he has her whipped severely, despite the fact that she is pregnant. Swollen and scarred, Sethe nevertheless runs away, but along the way she collapses from exhaustion in a forest. A white girl, Amy Denver, finds her and nurses her back to health. When Amy later helps Sethe deliver her baby in a boat, Sethe names this second daughter Denver after the girl who helped her. Sethe receives further help from Stamp Paid, who rows her across the Ohio River to Baby Suggs’s house. Baby Suggs cleans Sethe up before allowing her to see her three older children.
Sethe spends twenty-eight wonderful days in Cincinnati, where Baby Suggs serves as an unofficial preacher to the black community. On the last day, however, schoolteacher comes for Sethe to take her and her children back to Sweet Home. Rather than surrender her children to a life of dehumanizing slavery, she flees with them to the woodshed and tries to kill them. Only the third child, her older daughter, dies, her throat having been cut with a handsaw by Sethe. Sethe later arranges for the baby’s headstone to be carved with the word “Beloved.” The sheriff takes Sethe and Denver to jail, but a group of white abolitionists, led by the Bodwins, fights for her release. Sethe returns to the house at 124, where Baby Suggs has sunk into a deep depression. The community shuns the house, and the family continues to live in isolation.
Meanwhile, Paul D has endured torturous experiences in a chain gang in Georgia, where he was sent after trying to kill Brandywine, a slave owner to whom he was sold by schoolteacher. His traumatic experiences have caused him to lock away his memories, emotions, and ability to love in the “tin tobacco box” of his heart. One day, a fortuitous rainstorm allows Paul D and the other chain gang members to escape. He travels northward by following the blossoming spring flowers. Years later, he ends up on Sethe’s porch in Cincinnati.
Paul D’s arrival at 124 commences the series of events taking place in the present time frame. Prior to moving in, Paul D chases the house’s resident ghost away, which makes the already lonely Denver resent him from the start. Sethe and Paul D look forward to a promising future together, until one day, on their way home from a carnival, they encounter a strange young woman sleeping near the steps of 124. Most of the characters believe that the woman—who calls herself Beloved—is the embodied spirit of Sethe’s dead daughter, and the novel provides a wealth of evidence supporting this interpretation. Denver develops an obsessive attachment to Beloved, and Beloved’s attachment to Sethe is equally if not more intense. Paul D and Beloved hate each other, and Beloved controls Paul D by moving him around the house like a rag doll and by seducing him against his will.
When Paul D learns the story of Sethe’s “rough choice”—her infanticide—he leaves 124 and begins sleeping in the basement of the local church. In his absence, Sethe and Beloved’s relationship becomes more intense and exclusive. Beloved grows increasingly abusive, manipulative, and parasitic, and Sethe is obsessed with satisfying Beloved’s demands and making her understand why she murdered her. Worried by the way her mother is wasting away, Denver leaves the premises of 124 for the first time in twelve years in order to seek help from Lady Jones, her former teacher. The community provides the family with food and eventually organizes under the leadership of Ella, a woman who had worked on the Underground Railroad and helped with Sethe’s escape, in order to exorcise Beloved from 124. When they arrive at Sethe’s house, they see Sethe on the porch with Beloved, who stands smiling at them, naked and pregnant. Mr. Bodwin, who has come to 124 to take Denver to her new job, arrives at the house. Mistaking him for schoolteacher, Sethe runs at Mr. Bodwin with an ice pick. She is restrained, but in the confusion Beloved disappears, never to return.
Afterward, Paul D comes back to Sethe, who has retreated to Baby Suggs’s bed to die. Mourning Beloved, Sethe laments, “She was my best thing.” But Paul D replies, “You your best thing, Sethe.” The novel then ends with a warning that “[t]his is not a story to pass on.” The town, and even the residents of 124, have forgotten Beloved “[l]ike an unpleasant dream during a troubling sleep.”"
Penny,"Out of My Mind is told from the point of view of an eleven-year-old girl named Melody Brooks who was born with cerebral palsy. Melody cannot walk, talk, feed herself, or take herself to the bathroom. Her parents work hard at taking care of Melody. Their next-door neighbor, Mrs. Violet Valencia, also known as Mrs. V, is Melody’s part-time caregiver. Melody is extremely intelligent and absorbs all that she hears and sees. She has a photographic memory. She finds that she can hear colors and smell images when music is played. Melody wishes she wasn’t so restricted and wants to be able to live and communicate like any other kid.
When Melody is five years old, her mother takes her to a doctor, Dr. Hugely, to determine how smart she is and whether she can be enrolled in school. The doctor gives Melody inadequate assessments. He determines that Melody is severely brain-damaged. He suggests her parents send her to a school for the developmentally disabled or put her in a residential facility, so they do not have the burden of raising her. Her mother knows there is so much more to Melody and that she has true intelligence inside her. She tells Dr. Hugely he is wrong and insensitive, and she is going to enroll Melody in Spaulding Street Elementary School.
Melody starts elementary school and spends the next five years in a program designed for children with special needs. Initially, she is excited to be in classroom H-5, but eventually finds the learning program to be repetitive and unchallenging. When Melody was younger, her mother had attached a plastic tray to her wheelchair with common words, numbers, and phrases pasted on it for Melody to point to so she could communicate. Over time, that tray becomes too simplistic for Melody. Mrs. V wants to help Melody gain more language skills. She redesigns Melody’s communication board with a larger variety of nouns, verbs, adjectives, and pictures of people in her life so that Melody can point to them with her thumb and form a sentence. Mrs. V creates flash cards and teaches Melody new words every day. When Melody turns eight, her parents surprise her with a puppy named Butterscotch. A short time later, they welcome a new baby girl to the family, giving Melody a little sister named Penny.
When Melody starts fifth grade, her parents present her with an electric wheelchair, which gives Melody a sense of freedom she has never had before. Her school also starts an inclusion program to allow the H-5 students to interact with the other classes. During these classes, Melody meets a nice girl named Rose. Unfortunately, she also encounters two girls, Molly and Claire, who both have a reputation for being mean to almost everyone. Melody’s teacher, Mrs. Shannon, hires Catherine as an aide to help Melody in her classes. Melody and Catherine find a device called a Medi-Talker on the internet to help Melody communicate. Melody’s parents order it for her. The device provides a voice for her thoughts.
In Melody’s language arts class, her teacher, Miss Gordon, tells the students about an autobiography project they will be doing at the end of the year. Mr. Dimming, Melody’s history teacher, has the class participate in a practice exercise for their school’s Whiz Kids quiz team. Every year the school sends a team to the Whiz Kids competition. During the practice exercise, Melody achieves a perfect score. Her teacher and her classmates, particularly Molly and Claire, are shocked and skeptical. This skepticism bothers Melody but with the help of Catherine in school, and Mrs. V after school, she studies hard to properly prepare for the team tryouts. Melody takes the real test, getting another perfect score, and secures a place on the school team. Mr. Dimming apologizes to Melody for underestimating her. The quiz team spends the next two weeks studying and practicing after school. Even though Melody is part of the team, she does not feel a sense of belonging.
The Spaulding Street Elementary team competes in the southwest Ohio regional competition and wins. Melody receives an unwanted amount of media attention, which makes her team members jealous.
The Brooks family and Mrs. V take Melody and her mom to the airport so they can catch a plane headed to the Whiz Kids national finals in Washington, D.C. When they arrive at the airport, an airline employee informs them that their plane has been canceled due to bad weather. She tells them that the rest of the team arrived early and was able to board a different flight before the cancellations began. Melody is distraught that her team left her behind.
The next morning, Melody’s father comes into her room with the news that the team came in ninth place in the D.C. finals and won a tiny trophy. Melody decides she wants to go to school to show that she can rise above the whole situation and to see Catherine. It’s a very stormy day and due to the lightning, Melody is forced to use her manual wheelchair and her old Plexiglas communication board. With difficulty, her mother gets her into the car for school. Suddenly, Melody sees Penny run out of the house. Melody realizes her mother didn’t notice, so she starts frantically screaming and flailing about. Her mother, frustrated with Melody and the morning’s events, starts backing the car down the driveway, and they feel a soft thump. Horrified, they realize it was Penny. Penny has a badly broken leg and will undergo a surgical procedure, but she will be fine.
Melody goes to school to face her quiz team teammates. They all make excuses, even Mr. Dimming, as to why they didn’t call her and why they left her behind. The team wants to give Melody their little plastic trophy to make up for it. Melody starts giggling when suddenly her hand jerks, knocking the trophy to the ground and causing it to break. She uses her Medi-Talker to say that she doesn’t want it and they deserve it. Still laughing, she leaves the room.
At the end of fifth grade, Melody thinks that maybe she is not so different from everyone else after all. Perhaps she carries some of the same worries and attitudes as other fifth graders. She starts working on her autobiography for Miss Gordon’s class. She begins her autobiography titled Out of My Mind with ""I'm surrounded by thousands of words,"" the exact same words that start the book."
Advance,"A Raisin in the Sun portrays a few weeks in the life of the Youngers, a Black family living on the South Side of Chicago in the 1950s. When the play opens, the Youngers are about to receive an insurance check for $10,000. This money comes from the deceased Mr. Younger’s life insurance policy. Each of the adult members of the family has an idea as to what he or she would like to do with this money. The matriarch of the family, Mama, wants to buy a house to fulfill a dream she shared with her husband. Mama’s son, Walter Lee, would rather use the money to invest in a liquor store with his friends. He believes that the investment will solve the family’s financial problems forever. Walter’s wife, Ruth, agrees with Mama, however, and hopes that she and Walter can provide more space and opportunity for their son, Travis. Finally, Beneatha, Walter’s sister and Mama’s daughter, wants to use the money for her medical school tuition. She also wishes that her family members were not so interested in assimilating into the white world. Beneatha instead tries to find her identity by looking back to the past and to Africa.
As the play progresses, the Youngers clash over their competing dreams. Ruth discovers that she is pregnant but fears that if she has the child, she will put more financial pressure on her family members. When Walter says nothing to Ruth’s admission that she is considering abortion, Mama puts a down payment on a house for the whole family. She believes that a bigger, brighter dwelling will help them all. This house is in Clybourne Park, an entirely white neighborhood. When the Youngers’ future neighbors find out that the Youngers are moving in, they send Mr. Lindner, from the Clybourne Park Improvement Association, to offer the Youngers money in return for staying away. The Youngers refuse the deal, even after Walter loses the rest of the money ($6,500) to his friend Willy Harris, who persuades Walter to invest in the liquor store and then runs off with his cash.
In the meantime, Beneatha rejects her suitor, George Murchison, whom she believes to be shallow and blind to the problems of race. Subsequently, she receives a marriage proposal from her Nigerian boyfriend, Joseph Asagai, who wants Beneatha to get a medical degree and move to Africa with him (Beneatha does not make her choice before the end of the play). The Youngers eventually move out of the apartment, fulfilling the family’s long-held dream. Their future seems uncertain and slightly dangerous, but they are optimistic and determined to live a better life. They believe that they can succeed if they stick together as a family and resolve to defer their dreams no longer."
Peaceful,"Gene Forrester is a quiet, intellectual student at the Devon School in New Hampshire. During the summer session of 1942, he becomes close friends with his daredevil roommate Finny, whose innate charisma consistently allows him to get away with mischief. Finny prods Gene into making a dangerous jump out of a tree into a river, and the two start a secret society based on this ritual. Gene gradually begins to envy Finny’s astonishing athletic abilities, manifested in Finny’s breaking a school swimming record on his first try. He thinks that Finny, in turn, envies his superior academic achievements, and he suspects that his friend has been taking steps to distract him from his studies. Gene’s suspicions transform into resentful hatred, but he nevertheless carefully maintains an appearance of friendship.
Gene realizes that he has been grievously mistaken about the existence of any rivalry between them when, one day, Finny expresses a sincere desire to see Gene succeed. While still in a state of shock from the force of his realization, he accompanies Finny to the tree for their jumping ritual. When Finny reaches the edge of the branch, Gene’s knees bend, shaking the branch and causing Finny to fall to the bank and shatter his leg. The tragedy is generally considered an accident, and no one thinks to blame Gene—especially not Finny. But when the doctor tells Gene that Finny’s athletic days are over, Gene feels a piercing sense of guilt. He goes to see Finny and begins to admit his part in Finny’s fall, but the doctor interrupts him, and Finny is sent home before Gene gets another chance to confess.
The summer session ends, and Gene goes home to the South for a brief vacation. On his way back to school, he stops by Finny’s house and explains to his friend that he shook the branch on purpose. Finny refuses to listen to him, and Gene rescinds his confession and continues on to school. There, Gene attempts to avoid true athletic activity by becoming assistant manager of the crew team, but he feuds with the crew manager and quits. World War II is in full swing and the boys at Devon are all eager to enlist in the military. Brinker Hadley, a prominent class politician, suggests to Gene that they enlist together, and Gene agrees. That night, however, he finds Finny has returned to school. He consequently abandons his plans to enlist, as does Brinker. Finny expects Gene to take his place as the school’s sports star now that he is injured. When Gene protests that sports no longer seem important in the midst of the war, Finny declares that the war is nothing but a conspiracy to keep young men from eclipsing the older authorities.
Finny tells Gene that he once had aspirations to go to the Olympics, and Gene agrees to train for the 1944 Olympics in his place. All the boys are surprised when a gentle, nature-loving boy named Leper Lepellier becomes the first one in their class to enlist. Gene and Finny go on training, shielded within their private vision of world events. During a winter carnival, which Finny has organized, a telegram arrives for Gene from Leper, saying that he has “escaped” and desperately needs Gene to come to his home in Vermont. Gene goes to Vermont and finds that Leper has gone slightly mad. Leper, who was present at Finny’s accident, reveals that he knows the truth about what happened. Leper’s ranting frightens Gene and makes him anxious about how he himself might react to military life. He runs away back to Devon. When Brinker hears of what has happened to Leper, he laments in front of Finny that Devon has already lost two of its potential soldiers—Leper and the crippled Finny. Gene, afraid that Finny will be hurt by this remark, tries to raise his spirits by getting him to discuss his conspiracy theory again, but Finny now denies the war only ironically.
Brinker, who has harbored suspicions that Gene might have been partly responsible for Finny’s accident, wants to prove or disprove them definitively. He organizes an after-hours tribunal of schoolboys and has Gene and Finny summoned without warning. The boys on the makeshift tribunal question the two about the circumstances surrounding the fall. Finny’s perceptions of the incident remain so blurred that he cannot speak conclusively on the matter; Gene maintains that he doesn’t remember the details of it. The boys now bring in Leper, who was sighted earlier in the day skulking about the bushes, and Leper begins to implicate Gene. Finny declares that he does not care about the facts and rushes out of the room. Hurrying on the stairs, he falls and breaks his leg again.
Gene sneaks over to the school’s infirmary that night to see Finny, who angrily sends him away. Gene wanders the campus until he falls asleep under the football stadium. The next morning, he goes to see Finny again, takes full blame for the tragedy, apologizes, and tries to explain that his action did not arise from hatred. Finny accepts these statements and the two are reconciled. Later, as the doctor is operating on Finny’s leg, some marrow detaches from the bone and enters Finny’s bloodstream, going directly to his heart and killing him. Gene receives the news with relative tranquility; he feels that he has become a part of Finny and will always be with him. The rest of the boys graduate and go off to enlist in relatively safe branches of the military. Gene reflects on the constant enmity that plagues the human heart—a curse from which he believes that only Finny was immune."
Hoards,"Silas Marner is the weaver in the English countryside village of Raveloe in the early nineteenth century. Like many weavers of his time, he is an outsider—the object of suspicion because of his special skills and the fact that he has come to Raveloe from elsewhere. The villagers see Silas as especially odd because of the curious cataleptic fits he occasionally suffers. Silas has ended up in Raveloe because the members of his religious sect in Lantern Yard, an insular neighborhood in a larger town, falsely accused him of theft and excommunicated him.
	Much shaken after the accusation, Silas finds nothing familiar in Raveloe to reawaken his faith and falls into a numbing routine of solitary work. His one attempt at neighborliness backfires: when an herbal remedy he suggests for a neighbor’s illness works, he is rumored to be a sort of witch doctor. With little else to live for, Silas becomes infatuated with the money he earns for his work and hoards it, living off as little as possible. Every night he pulls his gold out from its hiding place beneath his floorboards to count it. He carries on in this way for fifteen years.
	Squire Cass is the wealthiest man in Raveloe, and his two eldest sons are Godfrey and Dunstan, or Dunsey. Dunsey is greedy and cruel, and enjoys tormenting Godfrey, the eldest son. Godfrey is good-natured but weak-willed, and, though secretly married to the opium addict Molly Farren, he is in love with Nancy Lammeter. Dunsey talked Godfrey into the marriage and repeatedly blackmails him with threats to reveal the marriage to their father. Godfrey gives Dunsey 100 pounds of the rent money paid to him by one of their father’s tenants. Godfrey then finds himself in a bind when Dunsey insists that Godfrey repay the sum himself. Dunsey once again threatens to reveal Godfrey’s marriage but, after some arguing, offers to sell Godfrey’s prize horse, Wildfire, to repay the loan.
	The next day, Dunsey meets with some friends who are hunting and negotiates the sale of the horse. Dunsey decides to participate in the hunt before finalizing the sale, and, in doing so, he has a riding accident that kills the horse. Knowing the rumors of Silas’s hoard, Dunsey makes plans to intimidate the weaver into lending him money. His walk home takes him by Silas’s cottage, and, finding the cottage empty, Dunsey steals the money instead.
	Silas returns from an errand to find his money gone. Overwhelmed by the loss, he runs to the local tavern for help and announces the theft to a sympathetic audience of tavern regulars. The theft becomes the talk of the village, and a theory arises that the thief might have been a peddler who came through the village some time before. Godfrey, meanwhile, is distracted by thoughts of Dunsey, who has not returned home. After hearing that Wildfire has been found dead, Godfrey decides to tell his father about the money, though not about his marriage. The Squire flies into a rage at the news, but does not do anything drastic to punish Godfrey.
	Silas is utterly disconsolate at the loss of his gold and numbly continues his weaving. Some of the townspeople stop by to offer their condolences and advice. Among these visitors, Dolly Winthrop stands out. Like many of the others, she encourages Silas to go to church—something he has not done since he was banished from Lantern Yard—but she is also gentler and more genuinely sympathetic.
	Nancy Lammeter arrives at Squire Cass’s famed New Year’s dance resolved to reject Godfrey’s advances because of his unsound character. However, Godfrey is more direct and insistent than he has been in a long time, and Nancy finds herself exhilarated by the evening in spite of her resolution. Meanwhile, Molly, Godfrey’s secret wife, is making her way to the Casses’ house to reveal the secret marriage. She has their daughter, a toddler, in her arms. Tiring after her long walk, Molly takes a draft of opium and passes out by the road. Seeing Silas’s cottage and drawn by the light of the fire, Molly’s little girl wanders through the open door and falls asleep at Silas’s hearth.
	Silas is having one of his fits at the time and does not notice the little girl enter his cottage. When he comes to, he sees her already asleep on his hearth, and is as stunned by her appearance as he was by the disappearance of his money. A while later, Silas traces the girl’s footsteps outside and finds Molly’s body lying in the snow. Silas goes to the Squire’s house to find the doctor, and causes a stir at the dance when he arrives with the baby girl in his arms. Godfrey, recognizing his daughter, accompanies the doctor to Silas’s cottage. When the doctor declares that Molly is dead, Godfrey realizes that his secret is safe. He does not claim his daughter, and Silas adopts her.
	Silas grows increasingly attached to the child and names her Eppie, after his mother and sister. With Dolly Winthrop’s help, Silas raises the child lovingly. Eppie begins to serve as a bridge between Silas and the rest of the villagers, who offer him help and advice and have come to think of him as an exemplary person because of what he has done. Eppie also brings Silas out of the benumbed state he fell into after the loss of his gold. In his newfound happiness, Silas begins to explore the memories of his past that he has long repressed.
	The novel jumps ahead sixteen years. Godfrey has married Nancy and Squire Cass has died. Godfrey has inherited his father’s house, but he and Nancy have no children. Their one daughter died at birth, and Nancy has refused to adopt. Eppie has grown into a pretty and spirited young woman, and Silas a contented father. The stone-pit behind Silas’s cottage is drained to water neighboring fields, and Dunsey’s skeleton is found at the bottom, along with Silas’s gold. The discovery frightens Godfrey, who becomes convinced that his own secrets are destined to be uncovered as well. He confesses the truth to Nancy about his marriage to Molly and fathering of Eppie. Nancy is not angry but regretful, saying that they could have adopted Eppie legitimately if Godfrey had told her earlier.
	That evening, Godfrey and Nancy decide to visit Silas’s cottage to confess the truth of Eppie’s lineage and claim her as their daughter. However, after hearing Godfrey and Nancy’s story, Eppie tells them she would rather stay with Silas than live with her biological father. Godfrey and Nancy leave, resigning themselves to helping Eppie from afar. The next day Silas decides to visit Lantern Yard to see if he was ever cleared of the theft of which he was accused years before. The town has changed almost beyond recognition, though, and Silas’s old chapel has been torn down to make way for a new factory. Silas realizes that his questions will never be answered, but he is content with the sense of faith he has regained through his life with Eppie. That summer Eppie is married to Aaron Winthrop, Dolly’s son. Aaron comes to live in Silas’s cottage, which has been expanded and refurbished at Godfrey’s expense."

Throw,"Starr Carter, a sixteen-year-old black girl, attends a party in her neighborhood, Garden Heights. Starr goes with Kenya, a friend with whom she shares an older half-brother, Seven. Ever since attending Williamson Prep, a primarily white school, Starr feels out of place in the Garden Heights social scene. When Kenya goes off with other friends, Starr runs into her childhood best friend, Khalil Harris, whom she hasn’t seen in a long time. Gunshots from a gang fight interrupt the party, and Khalil offers to take Starr home. While Khalil drives, he explains rapper Tupac Shakur’s idea that “Thug Life” stands for “The Hate U Give Little Infants F---- Everybody.” Soon after, a white police officer with the badge number one-fifteen pulls them over. Khalil questions the motivation for the stop, and One-Fifteen orders him out of the car and searches him. One-Fifteen commands Khalil not to move, and returns to his car. Khalil opens the door to check on Starr. One-Fifteen fatally shoots Khalil.
Starr has nightmares about the death of another childhood friend, Natasha, who died in the crossfire of a gang shooting. At school on Monday, Starr feels tense around Hailey and Chris, her white friend and boyfriend, as memories of Khalil’s death interrupt her thoughts and she realizes they don’t understand. At the urging of her uncle Carlos, a police officer, Starr goes into the police station after school with her mother, Lisa, to testify about Khalil’s shooting. Starr realizes that the officers are asking more questions about whether Khalil was a troublemaker than about the night of the shooting. She worries that justice for Khalil will not be served. At Khalil’s funeral, a lawyer and activist named April Ofrah confirms Starr’s fears when she announces that the police will not pursue legal action against One-Fifteen and invites the attendees to a rally in Khalil’s honor. Starr blames herself for the police’s inaction. King, the head of a local gang called the King Lords, also interrupts the funeral and places a gray bandana on Khalil’s casket, signifying Khalil’s membership in the King Lords. April Ofrah tells Starr to call her if she needs legal representation.
The news that the police won’t prosecute One-Fifteen leads to days of protests in Garden Heights. During this time, Maverick, Starr’s father, explains to her his interpretation of Tupac’s phrase “Thug Life.” He believes that Thug Life describes a system designed against black communities. Only by speaking out can black communities begin to break the cycle. At the Carter family’s grocery store, a teenage member of the King Lords named DeVante begs Maverick, a former King Lord, to help him leave the gang. Maverick agrees. Starr sees DeVante’s request as a chance to help someone in a similar situation as Khalil. A few days later, Maverick gets into an argument with the neighborhood barber, Mr. Lewis. Although the argument is peaceful, two police officers intervene, and when they see Maverick is Starr’s father, they push him to the ground and search him. Between this scary event and pressure from Kenya, Starr decides that she will no longer be silent.
The District Attorney calls Lisa to announce that a grand jury will hear the case against One-Fifteen and asks if Starr will testify. Starr agrees, and April Ofrah decides to represent Starr pro bono, and also find a way to get Starr a television interview. Meanwhile, DeVante tells Starr that Khalil had never been a member of the King Lords and only sold drugs for King to protect his mother, who had stolen money from King. During Starr’s television interview, she decides, against Ms. Ofrah’s advice, to talk about the truth behind Khalil’s drug dealing. Starr’s implication of King enrages him. The night before her grand jury testimony, someone throws a brick and fires a gun into the Carter household. Unsure if the culprits are the King Lords or the police, Starr almost backs out of testifying. However, she ultimately decides that Khalil needs her truth. She testifies before the grand jury.
Almost two months later, the grand jury announces their decision not to indict One-Fifteen. Starr and some of her friends get caught up in the resulting riots. As she tries to avoid the chaos, Starr stumbles upon a protest led by Ms. Ofrah. She offers Starr the megaphone, and Starr leads a chant in front of the protest. The police try to break up the protest with tear gas. Starr and her friends head to the Carter family store to get milk to help heal their eyes. A Molotov cocktail lands in the store, setting it ablaze and trapping them. Maverick arrives just in time to unlock the back door. King arrives to taunt them, proud about getting his revenge. The police arrive, and King, confident that no one will testify against him, claims ignorance. However, the neighbors rally around the Carter family and tell the police that they saw King throw the Molotov cocktail. The police arrest King. Although the grocery store is in ruins, Starr knows that the family will rebuild. She vows to continue fighting for justice on behalf of Khalil and all other black people killed at the hands of police."
Suicide,"As an ambulance arrives for the body of Mary Lisbon, the final Lisbon suicide, a group of neighborhood boys recalls the events of the past thirteen months.
It is June in suburbia, school is out, and summer has begun. Cecilia Lisbon, who at thirteen is the youngest of five cherubic Lisbon sisters slits her wrists while taking a bath. Her life is saved, but the hospital psychiatrist recommends that she be given a social outlet outside of school. Mr. Lisbon and Mrs. Lisbon allow the girls to throw a chaperoned party, at which Cecilia seems oblivious to her sisters and to the neighborhood boys who come as guests. Just as the party's awkwardness begins to abate, Cecilia asks to be excused. Ascending to her bedroom, she jumps out the window onto the fence below, and dies instantly.
Since the local cemetery workers are on strike, Cecilia cannot be buried, but is given last rites and taken to the mortuary freezer. The shocked community tries to come to terms with her death, the first death in the boys' lifetime. The tragedy only makes the remaining Lisbon sisters more fascinating to the boys, who manage to obtain Cecilia's surprisingly mundane diary and read it aloud obsessively to each other, imagining themselves into the girls' lives. Yet they can neither find nor intuit a ready explanation for her death.
Unsure of how to console the reclusive Lisbons, the neighborhood women send flowers, while the men organize to remove the fence on which Cecilia landed. Neither act receives much response from the Lisbons, but the neighborhood feels its duty has been done. Summer ends, and the four remaining Lisbon girls return to school, where they keep largely to themselves. Mr. Lisbon, a high school math teacher, arrives early and throws himself into his work. Lux Lisbon, the prettiest of the sisters, has several clandestine relationships, despite her parents' categorical ban on dating.
Returning one afternoon from his usual smoke-up, Trip Fontaine, the local dream boy, ducks into the wrong classroom to avoid the headmaster. Seeing Lux, he falls irrevocably in love. At a school assembly, Trip invites himself to the Lisbon house to watch television, but finds upon arrival at the house that he has consigned himself to an evening at Mrs. Lisbon's side, able only to catch occasional glimpses of Lux's feet. As Trip sits in his car afterward lamenting the evening's failure, the car door opens, and Lux bursts in and begins voraciously kissing him. A moment later, she flees back into the house. Lux is grounded and Trip is hers.
As autumn progresses, the Lisbon house begins to physically deteriorate. The school holds a belated Day of Grieving, an oblique response to Cecilia's death, during which the hesitant teachers speak in general terms about sorrow while the Lisbon sisters spend the day in the bathroom. The school also hires a social worker, and although it is unknown whether the sisters actually confide in her, their spirits seem to lift and they begin to make friends. Trip Fontaine, via Mr. Lisbon, obtains Mrs. Lisbon's consent to take Lux to Homecoming on the conditions that Trip find dates for the other girls, that they all go in a group, and that the girls are home by 11 p.m.
On the night of Homecoming, the girls are radiant, despite their unnaturally coiffed hair and shapeless homemade dresses. The three neighborhood boys whom Trip has picked for Mary, Bonnie, and Therese are surprised to find the sisters engaging and completely normal. The sisters seem to enjoy themselves tremendously, and to no one's surprise Trip and Lux are voted Homecoming King and Queen. After the dance, Trip and Lux are nowhere to be found. The other boys take their dates home, but Lux does not arrive home until well after midnight, having been persuaded by Trip to sneak out of the dance and make love on the football field. After they make love, Trip abandons Lux, who is forced to walk home alone.
In response to Lux's disobedience, Mrs. Lisbon withdraws the girls from school, restricts them to the house, and draws the curtains of the house. She will later claim she wanted to give her daughters time alone to recover from Cecilia's suicide. Shortly afterwards, the boys begin to see Lux on the roof of the Lisbon house at night having sex with unknown men. When an ambulance appears at the Lisbon house several weeks later and Lux is wheeled out clutching her stomach, the neighborhood fears another suicide. In fact, Lux has faked a burst appendix in order to be taken to the hospital, where she can secretly obtain a pregnancy test. It is negative, and the sympathetic doctor tells her parents she had indigestion. Lux returns home.
The Lisbon house continues to deteriorate. In January, due to local parents' requests, a progressively unstable Mr. Lisbon is fired from his teaching post. In the months that follow, no one is seen leaving the Lisbon house, and even the grocer stops his weekly deliveries. In April, as spring breaks, the Parks Department comes to cut down the Lisbons' elm, which has caught Dutch elm disease. As the Parks Department is about to finish the job, the girls burst from the house and defiantly ring the dead stump, and the Park Department moves the tree indefinitely far down its lists of removals. Just as the boys begin to feel they have lost the girls entirely, notes begin appearing in the boys' bicycles and shrubbery. The boys, after several efforts, succeed in telephoning the Lisbon girls, playing a record over the phone, giving the girls their phone number, and hanging up. The next day the girls call back with a song, and the two groups trade songs all evening until the girls are forced to hang up. The boys' subsequent calls are not answered, but a note appears requesting their help on midnight of June 15th.
Arriving at the Lisbon house as instructed, ready to flee with the girls across the country, the boys find Lux smoking alone in the living room. She instructs them to wait in the living room for her sisters to finish packing while she, Lux, waits in the car. The boys wait until they are finally too suspicious. They begin to explore the house and find Bonnie's body hanging dead in the basement. Horrified, the boys flee home. Later, the boys realize that all the girls must have killed themselves—Bonnie by hanging, Therese by sleeping pills, Lux by asphyxiation—while the boys waited in the living room. Mary, who stuck her torso in the oven, is the only one whom the paramedics can save.
Though Mary will survive for a month more, the community assumes she is as good as dead. The Lisbons hire a housecleaner and put the house on the market. The media descends on the neighborhood, concocting sensationalist and factually incorrect stories about the girls' lives and deaths. In July, Mary finally dies by taking sleeping pills. Coincidentally, her death marks the last day of the cemetery workers' strike, so she and her sisters can all be buried properly. After the funeral, the Lisbon parents move away, and a new young couple buys their house and begin renovations.
At novel's end, the neighborhood boys, now middle-aged men, trace the suburb's decline following the Lisbon deaths, and lament the girls' suicides as selfish acts from which they have never been able to recover."
Common,"In Common Sense, Thomas Paine argues for American independence. His argument begins with more general, theoretical reflections about government and religion, then progresses onto the specifics of the colonial situation.
Paine begins by distinguishing between government and society. Society, according to Paine, is everything constructive and good that people join together to accomplish. Government, on the other hand, is an institution whose sole purpose is to protect us from our own vices. Government has its origins in the evil of man and is therefore a necessary evil at best. Paine says that government's sole purpose is to protect life, liberty and property, and that a government should be judged solely on the basis of the extent to which it accomplishes this goal.
Paine then considers an imagined scenario in which a small group of people has been placed on an island, and cut off from the rest of society. In time, these people develop ties with one another, and lawmaking becomes inevitable. Paine says the people will be much happier if they are responsible for the creation of the laws that rule them. Paine is also implicitly arguing that such a system of representation is also better for the American colonists. Having expressed his disagreement with British reign in America, Paine proceeds to launch a general attack on the British system of government. Paine says the British system is too complex and rife with contradictions, and that the monarchy is granted far too much power. The British system pretends to offer a reasonable system of checks and balances, but in fact, it does not.
From here Paine moves on to discuss, in general, the notions of monarchy and hereditary succession. Man, Pain argues, was born into a state of equality, and the distinction that has arisen between king and subject is an unnatural one. At first, Paine says, the world was without kings, but the ancient Jews decided they wanted a king. This angered God, but he allowed them to have one. Paine presents pages of biblical evidence detailing God's wrath at the idea of the Jews having a king. The conclusion Paine reaches is that the practice of monarchy originates from sin, and is an institution that the Bible and God condemn. Paine calls hereditary succession an abominable practice. He says that even if people were to choose to have a king, that does not legitimize that King's child acting as a future ruler. Furthermore, hereditary succession has brought with it innumerable evils, such as incompetent kings, corruption, and civil war.
Having dispensed with the preliminary theoretical issues, Paine sets in to discuss the details of the American situation. In response to the argument that America has flourished under British rule, and therefore ought to stay under the king, Paine says that such an argument fails to realize that America has evolved and no longer needs Britain's help. Some say that Britain has protected America, and therefore deserves allegiance, but Paine responds that Britain has only watched over America in order to secure its own economic well-being. Paine adds that most recently, instead of watching over the colonies, the British have been attacking them, and are therefore undeserving of American loyalty.
Paine says that the colonies have little to gain from remaining attached to Britain. Commerce can be better conducted with the rest of Europe, but only after America becomes independent. Paine also asserts that if the colonies remain attached to Britain, the same problems that have arisen in the past will arise in the future. Paine argues that it is necessary to seek independence now, as to do otherwise would only briefly cover up problems that will surely reemerge.
Paine even proposes the form of government that the independent colonies should adopt. His recommendation is for a representative democracy that gives roughly equal weight to each of the colonies.
Paine explains why the current time is a good time to break free of Britain. Primarily, Paine focuses on the present size of the colonies, and on their current capabilities. He presents an inventory of the British Navy and gives calculations revealing how America could build a navy of comparable size. Paine recommends this as a way of ensuring America's security and prosperity in trade. Paine also argues that America is sufficiently small as to be united now. If time were to elapse, and the population of the colonies to grow, the same feeling of unity would not be present. Paine adds that if the Americans revolt now, they can use the vast expanses of uncharted land to the West in order to pay down some of the debt they will incur.
Paine says that as a colony of Britain, America lacks respectability on the international scene. They are seen simply as rebels, and cannot form substantial alliances with other nations. In order to prosper in the long term, the colonies need to be independent. Paine says that, by declaring independence, America will be able to ask for the help of other countries in its struggle for freedom. For all of these reasons, Paine says it is imperative and urgent that the colonies declare independence."
Demonstrations,"Marjane “Marji” Satrapi is an intelligent, spirited, and very modern girl living with her parents in Iran’s capital of Tehran during the eventful period of Iranian history from the late 1970s into the early 1980s. In Persepolis: The Story of a Childhood, Marji’s remembers her life during those years, mostly from when she was about ten to age fourteen. This account includes how Marji and her family lived through and were affected by turbulent events that included the overthrow of the autocratic Shah of Iran by the Islamic revolution, the oppressive fundamentalist regime that replaced the Shah, and the devasting Iran-Iraq war.
The nation’s wealth has long made it a target of outside invaders, but Islamic revolution of 1979 has pushed out the Western-backed government of the Shah.  The revolution has ushered in a new Islamic regime that is bringing massive societal changes impacting how people are supposed to behave--including Marji and her family. Marji struggles to adjust to the changes at her liberal French bilingual school, which has become increasingly stricter. Girls are required to wear veils and female and male students are now separated. Marji’s wealthy and modern parents—her father, Ebi, and her mother, Taji—take part in the massive protests against the new regime’s strict rules on behavior (just as they had previously protested against the Shah’s regime). Marji’s parents worry when a photo of Marji’s mother a protest appears in newspapers magazines. Later, after a demonstration they are at turns violent, the Satrapis decide that openly protesting is too dangerous to continue to do.
Marji feels conflict between her own deeply spiritual feelings and the stark modernism of her parents. She talks to God at night and has believed she will become a prophet one day since she was six years old, Marji. But the revolution leads to Marji setting aside these ambitions while she studies and imitates protestors and revolutionaries. She mimics protestors in the garden of her house and studies books about famous revolutionaries and philosophers given to her by her parents. She fantasizes about becoming a hero and wants her parents to become heroes too. Marji’s relationship with God becomes strained, as she finds that she and God have less to talk about—although God does still come by to see her from time to time.
Marji thrills when she learns that rebels fill her family history. She learns that her grandfather was a prince and later a communist whom the Shah removed from power and that her uncle Anoosh, also a communist, spent nine years in prison during the Shah’s regime. Marji spends a short time with Anoosh, learning about his life. After the Shah fell from power in 1979, Anoosh was released from prison, but when Islamic fundamentalists consolidate their grip on power, they hunt Anoosh down, imprison him, and later execute him. Her new idol killed, Marji feels crushed. She completely abandons her faith in God and increasingly questions the pro-regime propaganda she hears—especially at school.
Marji deeply loves and identifies with of her parents, even if she does sometimes feel that their actions and behavior (as wealthy and privileged individuals) do not always live up to their pro-democratic and liberal rhetoric. Marji also has a special connection with her grandmother, who remains stoic and inspiring to Marji in spite of the turmoil and numerous tragedies stemming from political actions that impact her and the family. Marji’s uncle Anoosh is not Marji’s only direct experience with the cruel consequences of the government’s actions. Throughout the book, death and devastation occurs among Marji’s extended family and friends as direct results of the brutality and fanaticism of the Iranian regimes and the war with Iraq.
People had rejoiced when the Shah was forced out, but as Islamic fundamentalists retain power, Marji and her family watch as their neighbors’ behavior shifts back and forth to coincide with the current political winds. The neighbors go from wearing short skirts and drinking alcohol to covering themselves and denouncing the use of alcohol. Marji’s parents ask her to tell everyone that she prays every day, a lie they hope will keep Marji safe, but acknowledge that the rules seem foolish. Marji grows more rebellious, as she increasingly views the rules at school and elsewhere as hypocritical and difficult to follow. Armed with more knowledge and personal experience, Marji begins to act out in ways that put her safety at risk. In fact, she even (accidentally) hits her principal during an argument, which results in her expulsion from school. Fearing her rebellious behavior will get her killed, Marji’s mother tries to reason with Marji by telling her that it is not her responsibility to serve justice and that the bad guys eventually pay for their sins in the end.
The war with Iraq had originally inspired Marji to vocal patriotism in protection her country against another invasion, but Marji begins to realize there are greater forces behind the war. She sees how the Islamic regime needs the war to continue survive and keep power. The war promotes a sense of nationalism and pride in the public, and those who die in the war are hailed as “martyrs.” Marji sees thousands of poor boys lured into war without proper training. She becomes increasingly uncomfortable and aware of class differences within society. Poor young boys are lured into the army with gold-painted keys to the “kingdom of heaven” to help them enter paradise after dying on the battlefield, while children in her wealthy neighborhood are left alone.
More and more people try to escape Iran as the borders tighten and Iraqi forces bomb Tehran and other Iranian cities. Realizing that Marji’s chances of escaping Iran are narrowing, her parents make the difficult decision to send her abroad alone to finish school in Vienna, explaining that only a good education will free her of Iran. Marji feels heartbroken. She spends one last night with her grandmother, who gives her warm advice and inspires her to be compassionate and understanding while in Vienna. Marji gives away all of her prized contraband to her friends, including a Kim Wilde poster. At the airport, as Marji turns to say goodbye to her parents one last time to see that her mother, devasted by her only child’s departure, has fainted."
Violative,"Bigger Thomas, a poor, uneducated, twenty-year-old Black man in 1930s Chicago, wakes up one morning in his family’s cramped apartment on the South Side of the city. He sees a huge rat scamper across the room, which he corners and kills with a skillet. Having grown up under the climate of harsh racial prejudice in 1930s America, Bigger is burdened with a powerful conviction that he has no control over his life and that he cannot aspire to anything other than menial, low-wage labor. His mother pesters him to take a job with a rich white man named Mr. Dalton, but Bigger instead chooses to meet up with his friends to plan the robbery of a white man’s store.
Anger, fear, and frustration define Bigger’s daily existence, as he is forced to hide behind a façade of toughness or risk succumbing to despair. While Bigger and his gang have robbed many Black-owned businesses, they have never attempted to rob a white man. Bigger sees whites not as individuals, but as a natural, oppressive force—a great looming “whiteness” pressing down upon him. Bigger’s fear of confronting this force overwhelms him, but rather than admit his fear, he violently attacks a member of his gang to sabotage the robbery. Left with no other options, Bigger takes a job as a chauffeur for the Daltons.
Coincidentally, Mr. Dalton is also Bigger’s landlord, as he owns a controlling share of the company that manages the apartment building where Bigger’s family lives. Mr. Dalton and other wealthy real estate barons are effectively robbing the poor, Black tenants on Chicago’s South Side—they refuse to allow Black people to rent apartments in predominantly white neighborhoods, thus leading to overpopulation and artificially high rents in the predominantly Black South Side. Mr. Dalton sees himself as a benevolent philanthropist, however, as he donates money to Black schools and offers jobs to “poor, timid black boys” like Bigger. However, Mr. Dalton practices this token philanthropy mainly to alleviate his guilty conscience for exploiting poor Black people.
Mary, Mr. Dalton’s daughter, frightens and angers Bigger by ignoring the social taboos that govern the relations between white women and Black men. On his first day of work, Bigger drives Mary to meet her communist boyfriend, Jan. Eager to prove their progressive ideals and racial tolerance, Mary and Jan force Bigger to take them to a restaurant in the South Side. Despite Bigger’s embarrassment, they order drinks, and as the evening passes, all three of them get drunk. Bigger then drives around the city while Mary and Jan make out in the back seat. Afterward, Mary is too drunk to make it to her bedroom on her own, so Bigger helps her up the stairs. Drunk and aroused by his unprecedented proximity to a young white woman, Bigger begins to kiss Mary.
Just as Bigger places Mary on her bed, Mary’s blind mother, Mrs. Dalton, enters the bedroom. Though Mrs. Dalton cannot see him, her ghostlike presence terrifies him. Bigger worries that Mary, in her drunken condition, will reveal his presence. He covers her face with a pillow and accidentally smothers her to death. Unaware that Mary has been killed, Mrs. Dalton prays over her daughter and returns to bed. Bigger tries to conceal his crime by burning Mary’s body in the Daltons’ furnace. He decides to try to use the Daltons’ prejudice against communists to frame Jan for Mary’s disappearance. Bigger believes that the Daltons will assume Jan is dangerous and that he may have kidnapped their daughter for political purposes. Additionally, Bigger takes advantage of the Daltons’ racial prejudices to avoid suspicion, continuing to play the role of a timid, ignorant Black servant who would be unable to commit such an act.
Mary’s murder gives Bigger a sense of power and identity he has never known. Bigger’s girlfriend, Bessie, makes an offhand comment that inspires him to try to collect ransom money from the Daltons. They know only that Mary has vanished, not that she is dead. Bigger writes a ransom letter, playing upon the Daltons’ hatred of communists by signing his name “Red.” He then bullies Bessie to take part in the ransom scheme. However, Mary’s bones are found in the furnace, and Bigger flees with Bessie to an empty building. Bigger rapes Bessie and, frightened that she will give him away, bludgeons her to death with a brick after she falls asleep.
Bigger eludes the massive manhunt for as long as he can, but he is eventually captured after a dramatic shoot-out. The press and the public determine his guilt and his punishment before his trial even begins. The furious populace assumes that he raped Mary before killing her and burned her body to hide the evidence of the rape. Moreover, the white authorities and the white mob use Bigger’s crime as an excuse to terrorize the entire South Side .
Jan visits Bigger in jail. He says that he understands how he terrified, angered, and shamed Bigger through his violation of the social taboos that govern tense race relations. Jan enlists his friend, Boris A. Max, to defend Bigger free of charge. Jan and Max speak with Bigger as a human being, and Bigger begins to see whites as individuals and himself as their equal.
Max tries to save Bigger from the death penalty, arguing that while his client is responsible for his crime, it is vital to recognize that he is a product of his environment. Part of the blame for Bigger’s crimes belongs to the fearful, hopeless existence that he has experienced in a racist society since birth. Max warns that there will be more men like Bigger if America does not put an end to the vicious cycle of hatred and vengeance. Despite Max’s arguments, Bigger is sentenced to death.
Bigger is not a traditional hero by any means. However, Wright forces us to enter into Bigger’s mind and to understand the devastating effects of the social conditions in which he was raised. Bigger was not born a violent criminal. He is a “native son”: a product of American culture and the violence and racism that suffuse it."
Firmest,"Irene Redfield is a light-skinned Black woman who, in public places, occasionally passes for white, when she finds it convenient. Irene is a practical, determined person. She was born and raised in Chicago but now lives in Harlem with her husband, Brian, and their two boys. Brian is a successful doctor but dislikes his work. He would have preferred to move the entire family to another, less racist country long ago, but Irene has always insisted that the family belongs in New York.
One day, while back in Chicago for a visit, Irene has a chance meeting with a childhood friend, Clare. Clare is very different from Irene—self-centered, melodramatic, and reckless. Clare is even lighter-skinned than Irene, and in fact she has married a white man, John Bellew, without telling him that she is Black. They have a daughter. The Bellews live mostly in Europe but often spend time in the Unites States, depending on where John Bellew’s work in international banking takes him. Irene finds Clare strangely fascinating but does not like her company. She only reluctantly agrees to visit Clare at the Bellews’ hotel suite. Clare has invited a mutual light-skinned friend of theirs to join them. When John Bellew arrives, Irene is shocked to learn that he is a vehement racist. He openly declares that he hates Black people, not knowing that he is speaking to three of them.
Two years later, the Bellews have relocated to New York. Clare resumes contact with Irene, and Irene is not firm enough to insist that Clare leave her alone, if only to keep Clare’s secret safe. When Clare learns that Irene is planning a charity event at which upper-class Black people and white people will mingle, Clare insists on attending. Soon, she is at the Redfields’ home regularly and has become part of their social circle. In time, Irene suspects that Clare and Brian are having an affair. The Bellews are due to move back to Europe soon, but a chance downtown encounter between John Bellew and Irene, while Irene is with a darker-skinned friend, creates a crisis. If Bellew deduces that Clare, like Irene, is Black, he may divorce Clare and leave her free to pursue Brian.
The threat that Clare poses for Irene’s marriage and family life is unexpectedly removed when Bellew tracks Clare down at an all-Black party hosted by friends of the Redfields in their apartment atop a high residential building. Bellew angrily confronts Clare, but Clare smiles and acts unconcerned. When Irene angrily moves toward Clare and puts her hand on Clare’s arm, Clare tumbles out a nearby open window, to her death. The cause of her fall is unclear—whether she fainted and fell by accident, or fell deliberately. It is also possible that Irene pushed Clare, but no one accuses her."
Beloved,"Beloved begins in 1873 in Cincinnati, Ohio, where Sethe, a former slave, has been living with her eighteen-year-old daughter Denver. Sethe’s mother-in-law, Baby Suggs, lived with them until her death eight years earlier. Just before Baby Suggs’s death, Sethe’s two sons, Howard and Buglar, ran away. Sethe believes they fled because of the malevolent presence of an abusive ghost that has haunted their house at 124 Bluestone Road for years. Denver, however, likes the ghost, which everyone believes to be the spirit of her dead sister.
On the day the novel begins, Paul D, whom Sethe has not seen since they worked together on Mr. Garner’s Sweet Home plantation in Kentucky approximately twenty years earlier, stops by Sethe’s house. His presence resurrects memories that have lain buried in Sethe’s mind for almost two decades. From this point on, the story will unfold on two temporal planes. The present in Cincinnati constitutes one plane, while a series of events that took place around twenty years earlier, mostly in Kentucky, constitutes the other. This latter plane is accessed and described through the fragmented flashbacks of the major characters. Accordingly, we frequently read these flashbacks several times, sometimes from varying perspectives, with each successive narration of an event adding a little more information to the previous ones.
From these fragmented memories, the following story begins to emerge: Sethe, the protagonist, was born in the South to an African mother she never knew. When she is thirteen, she is sold to the Garners, who own Sweet Home and practice a comparatively benevolent kind of slavery. There, the other slaves, who are all men, lust after her but never touch her. Their names are Sixo, Paul D, Paul A, Paul F, and Halle. Sethe chooses to marry Halle, apparently in part because he has proven generous enough to buy his mother’s freedom by hiring himself out on the weekends. Together, Sethe and Halle have two sons, Howard and Buglar, as well as a baby daughter whose name we never learn. When she leaves Sweet Home, Sethe is also pregnant with a fourth child. After the eventual death of the proprietor, Mr. Garner, the widowed Mrs. Garner asks her sadistic, vehemently racist brother-in-law to help her run the farm. He is known to the slaves as schoolteacher, and his oppressive presence makes life on the plantation even more unbearable than it had been before. The slaves decide to run.
Schoolteacher and his nephews anticipate the slaves’ escape, however, and capture Paul D and Sixo. Schoolteacher kills Sixo and brings Paul D back to Sweet Home, where Paul D sees Sethe for what he believes will be the last time. She is still intent on running, having already sent her children ahead to her mother-in-law Baby Suggs’s house in Cincinnati. Invigorated by the recent capture, schoolteacher’s nephews seize Sethe in the barn and violate her, stealing the milk her body is storing for her infant daughter. Unbeknownst to Sethe, Halle is watching the event from a loft above her, where he lies frozen with horror. Afterward, Halle goes mad: Paul D sees him sitting by a churn with butter slathered all over his face. Paul D, meanwhile, is forced to suffer the indignity of wearing an iron bit in his mouth.
When schoolteacher finds out that Sethe has reported his and his nephews’ misdeeds to Mrs. Garner, he has her whipped severely, despite the fact that she is pregnant. Swollen and scarred, Sethe nevertheless runs away, but along the way she collapses from exhaustion in a forest. A white girl, Amy Denver, finds her and nurses her back to health. When Amy later helps Sethe deliver her baby in a boat, Sethe names this second daughter Denver after the girl who helped her. Sethe receives further help from Stamp Paid, who rows her across the Ohio River to Baby Suggs’s house. Baby Suggs cleans Sethe up before allowing her to see her three older children.
Sethe spends twenty-eight wonderful days in Cincinnati, where Baby Suggs serves as an unofficial preacher to the black community. On the last day, however, schoolteacher comes for Sethe to take her and her children back to Sweet Home. Rather than surrender her children to a life of dehumanizing slavery, she flees with them to the woodshed and tries to kill them. Only the third child, her older daughter, dies, her throat having been cut with a handsaw by Sethe. Sethe later arranges for the baby’s headstone to be carved with the word “Beloved.” The sheriff takes Sethe and Denver to jail, but a group of white abolitionists, led by the Bodwins, fights for her release. Sethe returns to the house at 124, where Baby Suggs has sunk into a deep depression. The community shuns the house, and the family continues to live in isolation.
Meanwhile, Paul D has endured torturous experiences in a chain gang in Georgia, where he was sent after trying to kill Brandywine, a slave owner to whom he was sold by schoolteacher. His traumatic experiences have caused him to lock away his memories, emotions, and ability to love in the “tin tobacco box” of his heart. One day, a fortuitous rainstorm allows Paul D and the other chain gang members to escape. He travels northward by following the blossoming spring flowers. Years later, he ends up on Sethe’s porch in Cincinnati.
Paul D’s arrival at 124 commences the series of events taking place in the present time frame. Prior to moving in, Paul D chases the house’s resident ghost away, which makes the already lonely Denver resent him from the start. Sethe and Paul D look forward to a promising future together, until one day, on their way home from a carnival, they encounter a strange young woman sleeping near the steps of 124. Most of the characters believe that the woman—who calls herself Beloved—is the embodied spirit of Sethe’s dead daughter, and the novel provides a wealth of evidence supporting this interpretation. Denver develops an obsessive attachment to Beloved, and Beloved’s attachment to Sethe is equally if not more intense. Paul D and Beloved hate each other, and Beloved controls Paul D by moving him around the house like a rag doll and by seducing him against his will.
When Paul D learns the story of Sethe’s “rough choice”—her infanticide—he leaves 124 and begins sleeping in the basement of the local church. In his absence, Sethe and Beloved’s relationship becomes more intense and exclusive. Beloved grows increasingly abusive, manipulative, and parasitic, and Sethe is obsessed with satisfying Beloved’s demands and making her understand why she murdered her. Worried by the way her mother is wasting away, Denver leaves the premises of 124 for the first time in twelve years in order to seek help from Lady Jones, her former teacher. The community provides the family with food and eventually organizes under the leadership of Ella, a woman who had worked on the Underground Railroad and helped with Sethe’s escape, in order to exorcise Beloved from 124. When they arrive at Sethe’s house, they see Sethe on the porch with Beloved, who stands smiling at them, naked and pregnant. Mr. Bodwin, who has come to 124 to take Denver to her new job, arrives at the house. Mistaking him for schoolteacher, Sethe runs at Mr. Bodwin with an ice pick. She is restrained, but in the confusion Beloved disappears, never to return.
Afterward, Paul D comes back to Sethe, who has retreated to Baby Suggs’s bed to die. Mourning Beloved, Sethe laments, “She was my best thing.” But Paul D replies, “You your best thing, Sethe.” The novel then ends with a warning that “[t]his is not a story to pass on.” The town, and even the residents of 124, have forgotten Beloved “[l]ike an unpleasant dream during a troubling sleep.”"
Borrowing,"A Doll’s House opens on Christmas Eve. Nora Helmer enters her well-furnished living room—the setting of the entire play—carrying several packages. Torvald Helmer, Nora’s husband, comes out of his study when he hears her arrive. He greets her playfully and affectionately, but then chides her for spending so much money on Christmas gifts. Their conversation reveals that the Helmers have had to be careful with money for many years, but that Torvald has recently obtained a new position at the bank where he works that will afford them a more comfortable lifestyle.
Helene, the maid, announces that the Helmers’ dear friend Dr. Rank has come to visit. At the same time, another visitor has arrived, this one unknown. To Nora’s great surprise, Kristine Linde, a former school friend, comes into the room. The two have not seen each other for years, but Nora mentions having read that Mrs. Linde’s husband passed away a few years earlier. Mrs. Linde tells Nora that when her husband died, she was left with no money and no children. Nora tells Mrs. Linde about her first year of marriage to Torvald. She explains that they were very poor and both had to work long hours. Torvald became sick, she adds, and the couple had to travel to Italy so that Torvald could recover.
Nora inquires further about Mrs. Linde’s life, and Mrs. Linde explains that for years she had to care for her sick mother and her two younger brothers. She states that her mother has passed away, though, and that the brothers are too old to need her. Instead of feeling relief, Mrs. Linde says she feels empty because she has no occupation; she hopes that Torvald may be able to help her obtain employment. Nora promises to speak to Torvald and then reveals a great secret to Mrs. Linde—without Torvald’s knowledge, Nora illegally borrowed money for the trip that she and Torvald took to Italy; she told Torvald that the money had come from her father. For years, Nora reveals, she has worked and saved in secret, slowly repaying the debt, and soon it will be fully repaid.
Krogstad, a low-level employee at the bank where Torvald works, arrives and proceeds into Torvald’s study. Nora reacts uneasily to Krogstad’s presence, and Dr. Rank, coming out of the study, says Krogstad is “morally sick.” Once he has finished meeting with Krogstad, Torvald comes into the living room and says that he can probably hire Mrs. Linde at the bank. Dr. Rank, Torvald, and Mrs. Linde then depart, leaving Nora by herself. Nora’s children return with their nanny, Anne-Marie, and Nora plays with them until she notices Krogstad’s presence in the room. The two converse, and Krogstad is revealed to be the source of Nora’s secret loan.
Krogstad states that Torvald wants to fire him from his position at the bank and alludes to his own poor reputation. He asks Nora to use her influence to ensure that his position remains secure. When she refuses, Krogstad points out that he has in his possession a contract that contains Nora’s forgery of her father’s signature. Krogstad blackmails Nora, threatening to reveal her crime and to bring shame and disgrace on both Nora and her husband if she does not prevent Torvald from firing him. Krogstad leaves, and when Torvald returns, Nora tries to convince him not to fire Krogstad, but Torvald will hear nothing of it. He declares Krogstad an immoral man and states that he feels physically ill in the presence of such people.
Act Two opens on the following day, Christmas. Alone, Nora paces her living room, filled with anxiety. Mrs. Linde arrives and helps sew Nora’s costume for the ball that Nora will be attending at her neighbors’ home the following evening. Nora tells Mrs. Linde that Dr. Rank has a mortal illness that he inherited from his father. Nora’s suspicious behavior leads Mrs. Linde to guess that Dr. Rank is the source of Nora’s loan. Nora denies Mrs. Linde’s charge but refuses to reveal the source of her distress. Torvald arrives, and Nora again begs him to keep Krogstad employed at the bank, but again Torvald refuses. When Nora presses him, he admits that Krogstad’s moral behavior isn’t all that bothers him—he dislikes Krogstad’s overly familiar attitude. Torvald and Nora argue until Torvald sends the maid to deliver Krogstad’s letter of dismissal.
Torvald leaves. Dr. Rank arrives and tells Nora that he knows he is close to death. She attempts to cheer him up and begins to flirt with him. She seems to be preparing to ask him to intervene on her behalf in her struggle with Torvald. Suddenly, Dr. Rank reveals to Nora that he is in love with her. In light of this revelation, Nora refuses to ask Dr. Rank for anything.
Once Dr. Rank leaves, Krogstad arrives and demands an explanation for his dismissal. He wants respectability and has changed the terms of the blackmail: he now insists to Nora not only that he be rehired at the bank but that he be rehired in a higher position. He then puts a letter detailing Nora’s debt and forgery in the Helmers’ letterbox. In a panic, Nora tells Mrs. Linde everything, and Mrs. Linde instructs Nora to delay Torvald from opening the letter as long as possible while she goes to speak with Krogstad. In order to distract Torvald from the letterbox, Nora begins to practice the tarantella she will perform at that evening’s costume party. In her agitated emotional state, she dances wildly and violently, displeasing Torvald. Nora manages to make Torvald promise not to open his mail until after she performs at the party. Mrs. Linde soon returns and says that she has left Krogstad a note but that he will be gone until the following evening.
The next night, as the costume party takes place upstairs, Krogstad meets Mrs. Linde in the Helmers’ living room. Their conversation reveals that the two had once been deeply in love, but Mrs. Linde left Krogstad for a wealthier man who would enable her to support her family. She tells Krogstad that now that she is free of her own familial obligations and wishes to be with Krogstad and care for his children. Krogstad is overjoyed and says he will demand his letter back before Torvald can read it and learn Nora’s secret. Mrs. Linde, however, insists he leave the letter, because she believes both Torvald and Nora will be better off once the truth has been revealed.
Soon after Krogstad’s departure, Nora and Torvald enter, back from the costume ball. After saying goodnight to Mrs. Linde, Torvald tells Nora how desirable she looked as she danced. Dr. Rank, who was also at the party and has come to say goodnight, promptly interrupts Torvald’s advances on Nora. After Dr. Rank leaves, Torvald finds in his letterbox two of Dr. Rank’s visiting cards, each with a black cross above the name. Nora knows Dr. Rank’s cards constitute his announcement that he will soon die, and she informs Torvald of this fact. She then insists that Torvald read Krogstad’s letter.
Torvald reads the letter and is outraged. He calls Nora a hypocrite and a liar and complains that she has ruined his happiness. He declares that she will not be allowed to raise their children. Helene then brings in a letter. Torvald opens it and discovers that Krogstad has returned Nora’s contract (which contains the forged signature). Overjoyed, Torvald attempts to dismiss his past insults, but his harsh words have triggered something in Nora. She declares that despite their eight years of marriage, they do not understand one another. Torvald, Nora asserts, has treated her like a “doll” to be played with and admired. She decides to leave Torvald, declaring that she must “make sense of [her]self and everything around her.” She walks out, slamming the door behind her."
If,"In the midst of a raging war, a plane evacuating a group of schoolboys from Britain is shot down over a deserted tropical island. Two of the boys, Ralph and Piggy, discover a conch shell on the beach, and Piggy realizes it could be used as a horn to summon the other boys. Once assembled, the boys set about electing a leader and devising a way to be rescued. They choose Ralph as their leader, and Ralph appoints another boy, Jack, to be in charge of the boys who will hunt food for the entire group.
Ralph, Jack, and another boy, Simon, set off on an expedition to explore the island. When they return, Ralph declares that they must light a signal fire to attract the attention of passing ships. The boys succeed in igniting some dead wood by focusing sunlight through the lenses of Piggy’s eyeglasses. However, the boys pay more attention to playing than to monitoring the fire, and the flames quickly engulf the forest. A large swath of dead wood burns out of control, and one of the youngest boys in the group disappears, presumably having burned to death.
At first, the boys enjoy their life without grown-ups and spend much of their time splashing in the water and playing games. Ralph, however, complains that they should be maintaining the signal fire and building huts for shelter. The hunters fail in their attempt to catch a wild pig, but their leader, Jack, becomes increasingly preoccupied with the act of hunting.
When a ship passes by on the horizon one day, Ralph and Piggy notice, to their horror, that the signal fire—which had been the hunters’ responsibility to maintain—has burned out. Furious, Ralph accosts Jack, but the hunter has just returned with his first kill, and all the hunters seem gripped with a strange frenzy, reenacting the chase in a kind of wild dance. Piggy criticizes Jack, who hits Piggy across the face. Ralph blows the conch shell and reprimands the boys in a speech intended to restore order. At the meeting, it quickly becomes clear that some of the boys have started to become afraid. The littlest boys, known as “littluns,” have been troubled by nightmares from the beginning, and more and more boys now believe that there is some sort of beast or monster lurking on the island. The older boys try to convince the others at the meeting to think rationally, asking where such a monster could possibly hide during the daytime. One of the littluns suggests that it hides in the sea—a proposition that terrifies the entire group.
Not long after the meeting, some military planes engage in a battle high above the island. The boys, asleep below, do not notice the flashing lights and explosions in the clouds. A parachutist drifts to earth on the signal-fire mountain, dead. Sam and Eric, the twins responsible for watching the fire at night, are asleep and do not see the parachutist land. When the twins wake up, they see the enormous silhouette of his parachute and hear the strange flapping noises it makes. Thinking the island beast is at hand, they rush back to the camp in terror and report that the beast has attacked them.
The boys organize a hunting expedition to search for the monster. Jack and Ralph, who are increasingly at odds, travel up the mountain. They see the silhouette of the parachute from a distance and think that it looks like a huge, deformed ape. The group holds a meeting at which Jack and Ralph tell the others of the sighting. Jack says that Ralph is a coward and that he should be removed from office, but the other boys refuse to vote Ralph out of power. Jack angrily runs away down the beach, calling all the hunters to join him. Ralph rallies the remaining boys to build a new signal fire, this time on the beach rather than on the mountain. They obey, but before they have finished the task, most of them have slipped away to join Jack.
Jack declares himself the leader of the new tribe of hunters and organizes a hunt and a violent, ritual slaughter of a sow to solemnize the occasion. The hunters then decapitate the sow and place its head on a sharpened stake in the jungle as an offering to the beast. Later, encountering the bloody, fly-covered head, Simon has a terrible vision, during which it seems to him that the head is speaking. The voice, which he imagines as belonging to the Lord of the Flies, says that Simon will never escape him, for he exists within all men. Simon faints. When he wakes up, he goes to the mountain, where he sees the dead parachutist. Understanding then that the beast does not exist externally but rather within each individual boy, Simon travels to the beach to tell the others what he has seen. But the others are in the midst of a chaotic revelry—even Ralph and Piggy have joined Jack’s feast—and when they see Simon’s shadowy figure emerge from the jungle, they fall upon him and kill him with their bare hands and teeth.
The following morning, Ralph and Piggy discuss what they have done. Jack’s hunters attack them and their few followers and steal Piggy’s glasses in the process. Ralph’s group travels to Jack’s stronghold in an attempt to make Jack see reason, but Jack orders Sam and Eric tied up and fights with Ralph. In the ensuing battle, one boy, Roger, rolls a boulder down the mountain, killing Piggy and shattering the conch shell. Ralph barely manages to escape a torrent of spears.
Ralph hides for the rest of the night and the following day, while the others hunt him like an animal. Jack has the other boys ignite the forest in order to smoke Ralph out of his hiding place. Ralph stays in the forest, where he discovers and destroys the sow’s head, but eventually, he is forced out onto the beach, where he knows the other boys will soon arrive to kill him. Ralph collapses in exhaustion, but when he looks up, he sees a British naval officer standing over him. The officer’s ship noticed the fire raging in the jungle. The other boys reach the beach and stop in their tracks at the sight of the officer. Amazed at the spectacle of this group of bloodthirsty, savage children, the officer asks Ralph to explain. Ralph is overwhelmed by the knowledge that he is safe but, thinking about what has happened on the island, he begins to weep. The other boys begin to sob as well. The officer turns his back so that the boys may regain their composure."
How,"Guy Montag is a fireman who burns books in a futuristic American city. In Montag’s world, firemen start fires rather than putting them out. The people in this society do not read books, enjoy nature, spend time by themselves, think independently, or have meaningful conversations. Instead, they drive very fast, watch excessive amounts of television on wall-size sets, and listen to the radio on “Seashell Radio” sets attached to their ears.
Montag encounters a gentle seventeen-year-old girl named Clarisse McClellan, who opens his eyes to the emptiness of his life with her innocently penetrating questions and her unusual love of people and nature. Over the next few days, Montag experiences a series of disturbing events. First, his wife, Mildred, attempts suicide by swallowing a bottle of sleeping pills. Then, when he responds to an alarm that an old woman has a stash of hidden literature, the woman shocks him by choosing to be burned alive along with her books. A few days later, he hears that Clarisse has been killed by a speeding car. Montag’s dissatisfaction with his life increases, and he begins to search for a solution in a stash of books that he has stolen from his own fires and hidden inside an air-conditioning vent.
When Montag fails to show up for work, his fire chief, Beatty, pays a visit to his house. Beatty explains that it’s normal for a fireman to go through a phase of wondering what books have to offer, and he delivers a dizzying monologue explaining how books came to be banned in the first place. According to Beatty, special-interest groups and other “minorities” objected to books that offended them. Soon, books all began to look the same, as writers tried to avoid offending anybody. This was not enough, however, and society as a whole decided to simply burn books rather than permit conflicting opinions. Beatty tells Montag to take twenty-four hours or so to see if his stolen books contain anything worthwhile and then turn them in for incineration. Montag begins a long and frenzied night of reading.
Overwhelmed by the task of reading, Montag looks to his wife for help and support, but she prefers television to her husband’s company and cannot understand why he would want to take the terrible risk of reading books. He remembers that he once met a retired English professor named Faber sitting in a park, and he decides that this man might be able to help him understand what he reads. He visits Faber, who tells him that the value of books lies in the detailed awareness of life that they contain. Faber says that Montag needs not only books but also the leisure to read them and the freedom to act upon their ideas.
Faber agrees to help Montag with his reading, and they concoct a risky scheme to overthrow the status quo. Faber will contact a printer and begin reproducing books, and Montag will plant books in the homes of firemen to discredit the profession and to destroy the machinery of censorship. Faber gives him a two-way radio earpiece (the “green bullet”) so that he can hear what Montag hears and talk to him secretly.
Montag goes home, and soon two of his wife’s friends arrive to watch television. The women discuss their families and the war that is about to be declared in an extremely frivolous manner. Their superficiality angers him, and he takes out a book of poetry and reads “Dover Beach” by Matthew Arnold. Faber buzzes in his ear for him to be quiet, and Mildred tries to explain that the poetry reading is a standard way for firemen to demonstrate the uselessness of literature. The women are extremely disturbed by the poem and leave to file a complaint against Montag.
Montag goes to the fire station and hands over one of his books to Beatty. Beatty confuses Montag by barraging him with contradictory quotations from great books. Beatty exploits these contradictions to show that literature is morbid and dangerously complex, and that it deserves incineration. Suddenly, the alarm sounds, and they rush off to answer the call, only to find that the alarm is at Montag’s own house. Mildred gets into a cab with her suitcase, and Montag realizes that his own wife has betrayed him.
Beatty forces Montag to burn the house himself; when he is done, Beatty places him under arrest. When Beatty continues to berate Montag, Montag turns the flamethrower on his superior and proceeds to burn him to ashes. Montag knocks the other firemen unconscious and runs. The Mechanical Hound, a monstrous machine that Beatty has set to attack Montag, pounces and injects Montag’s leg with a large dose of anesthetic. Montag manages to destroy it with his flamethrower; then he walks off the numbness in his leg and escapes with some books that were hidden in his backyard. He hides these in another fireman’s house and calls in an alarm from a pay phone.
Montag goes to Faber’s house, where he learns that a new Hound has been put on his trail, along with several helicopters and a television crew. Faber tells Montag that he is leaving for St. Louis to see a retired printer who may be able to help them. Montag gives Faber some money and tells him how to remove Montag’s scent from his house so the Hound will not enter it. Montag then takes some of Faber’s old clothes and runs off toward the river. The whole city watches as the chase unfolds on TV, but Montag manages to escape in the river and change into Faber’s clothes to disguise his scent. He drifts downstream into the country and follows a set of abandoned railroad tracks until he finds a group of renegade intellectuals (“the Book People”), led by a man named Granger, who welcome him. They are a part of a nationwide network of book lovers who have memorized many great works of literature and philosophy. They hope that they may be of some help to mankind in the aftermath of the war that has just been declared. Montag’s role is to memorize the Book of Ecclesiastes. Enemy jets appear in the sky and completely obliterate the city with bombs. Montag and his new friends move on to search for survivors and rebuild civilization."
Lessons,"Grant Wiggins has been teaching on a plantation outside Bayonne, Louisiana, for several years when a slow-witted man named Jefferson is convicted of murder and sentenced to death. Jefferson claims he is innocent of the crime. He says he was on his way to a bar, but changed his mind and decided to tag along with two men who were on their way to a liquor store. Upon arriving there, the two men began arguing with the storeowner, and a shootout ensued. The storeowner and the two men died, and Jefferson remained at the scene of the crime. He was arrested and tried for murder. Jefferson’s lawyer argues in court that Jefferson is nothing but a poor fool, hardly more worthwhile than a hog, and therefore incapable of plotting such a scheme. The jury quickly brings back a guilty verdict.
	Upon hearing the lawyer’s speech, Jefferson’s godmother, Miss Emma, resolves to help Jefferson die like a man, not a hog. She asks Grant to help her, knowing that he will resist. Grant left many years prior to attend college, and he returned an educated man. He deplores the injustices done to his fellow black men, but he does not want to get involved in Jefferson’s case. However, after considerable pressure from his aunt, Tante Lou, he agrees to try to help Jefferson. Grant, Miss Emma, and Grant’s aunt go to visit Jefferson in his cell, and they discover that he too heard the lawyer’s words and has taken them to heart. Silent and moody, Jefferson resists Grant’s feeble attempts to reach him. The three visitors spend an uncomfortable hour in the cell and then leave.
	During the next few visits, Jefferson continues to frustrate Grant’s attempts to communicate. When Grant attempts to teach Jefferson about dignity, Jefferson insists that dignity is for “youmans,” not hogs. He eats and snuffles in imitation of a hog and tries to anger Grant with stubbornness and malice, but Grant maintains his patience. Each hour-long visit ends in failure, but Grant continues to try to reach Jefferson. On his fourth visit, Grant sparks a conversation with Jefferson about his final meal. Jefferson admits that he wants a gallon of vanilla ice cream because, although he loves ice cream, he has never had more than a thimbleful at a time. This admission begins to break down the barrier between the two men. Grant borrows money from some townspeople and buys Jefferson a small radio. On his next visit, he brings Jefferson a notebook and asks him to write down whatever thoughts come to his mind. Jefferson promises to do so, and by Grant’s next visit, Jefferson has filled most of a page with thoughts concerning the difference between hogs and men.
	Grant’s relationships with his girlfriend Vivian and with Reverend Ambrose begin to intensify. Despite her love for Grant, Vivian dislikes his tendency to think only of himself, showing little regard for her needs. Grant uses Vivian to escape the troubles of his life, and he continually suggests that they run away from their hometown and their past in the South. The Reverend Ambrose, himself unable to reach Jefferson, urges Grant to put aside his atheistic beliefs and help save not just Jefferson’s character, but his soul. The Reverend declares that Grant must learn to tell lies for the good of others.
	Grant focuses his energy on Jefferson and tries to explain the importance of Jefferson’s death. Jefferson asks Grant if he believes in heaven and Grant replies that he does not, although he qualifies this remark by saying that his atheism does not make him a good man. In fact, Grant says, Jefferson will save even Grant’s atheistic soul if he carries the cross for the sinners on earth. Grant explains that the black community in the quarter has spent centuries enslaved to white men, and that when Jefferson’s attorney called him a hog, he attacked the will and intelligence of the entire black society. In consequence, Jefferson now has the opportunity to stand up for his community. He has become a symbol to his people, and the manner in which he faces his death will bear on their self--confidence and potential.
	Over the next few weeks, Jefferson continues to write in his journal. In March, the governor of Louisiana sets the execution date for two weeks after Easter. As news of Jefferson’s impending death spreads through the town, more and more people begin to visit him. Young children and old men, strangers and friends, all come to -Jefferson’s cell to speak to him. The onslaught of attention makes Jefferson begin to understand the enormity of the task that Grant has given him. He realizes that he has become much more than an ordinary man and that his death will represent much more than an ordinary death. Elated by Jefferson’s progress, Grant nevertheless dreads the execution day, when that progress will be tested.
	Grant cannot bring himself to attend the execution, for he has grown very close to Jefferson. At the time the execution is scheduled to take place, he orders his students to kneel by their desks in honor of Jefferson. He steps outside the classroom, distressed and bewildered. He knows he should have attended the execution. A few minutes later, a deputy comes down from the courthouse and informs Grant that the execution is over. He assures Grant that Jefferson was the bravest man in the room that morning. Grant looks out over the town, numb and heavyhearted, and discovers that he is crying."
Shock,"Janie Crawford, an attractive, confident, middle-aged Black woman, returns to Eatonville, Florida, after a long absence. The Black townspeople gossip about her and speculate about where she has been and what has happened to her young husband, Tea Cake. They take her confidence as aloofness, but Janie’s friend Pheoby Watson sticks up for her. Pheoby visits her to find out what has happened. Their conversation frames the story that Janie relates.
Janie explains that her grandmother raised her after her mother ran off. Nanny loves her granddaughter and is dedicated to her, but her life as a slave and experience with her own daughter, Janie’s mother, has warped her worldview. Her primary desire is to marry Janie as soon as possible to a husband who can provide security and social status for her. She finds a much older farmer named Logan Killicks and insists that Janie marry him.
After moving in with Logan, Janie is miserable. Logan is pragmatic and unromantic and, in general, treats her like a pack mule. One day, Joe Starks, a smooth-tongued and ambitious man, ambles down the road in front of the farm. He and Janie flirt in secret for a couple weeks before she runs off and marries him.
Janie and Jody, as she calls him, travel to all-Black Eatonville, where Jody hopes to have a “big voice.” A consummate politician, Jody soon succeeds in becoming the mayor, postmaster, storekeeper, and the biggest landlord in town. But Janie seeks something more than a man with a big voice. She soon becomes disenchanted with the monotonous, stifling life that she shares with Jody. She wishes that she could be a part of the rich social life in town, but Jody doesn’t allow her to interact with “common” people. Jody sees Janie as the fitting ornament to his wealth and power, and he tries to shape her into his vision of what a mayor’s wife should be. On the surface, Janie silently submits to Jody; inside, however, she remains passionate and full of dreams.
After almost two decades of marriage, Janie finally asserts herself. When Jody insults her appearance, Janie rips him to shreds in front of the townspeople, telling them all how ugly and impotent he is. In retaliation, he savagely beats her. Their marriage breaks down, and Jody becomes quite ill. After months without interacting, Janie visits him on his deathbed. Refusing to be silenced, she once again chastises him for the way that he treated her. As she berates him, he dies.
After Jody’s funeral, Janie feels free for the first time in years. She rebuffs various suitors who come to court her because she loves her newfound independence. But when Tea Cake, a man twelve years her junior, enters her life, Janie immediately senses a spark of mutual attraction. She begins dating Tea Cake despite critical gossip within the town. To everyone’s shock, Janie then marries Tea Cake nine months after Jody’s death, sells Jody’s store, and leaves town to go with Tea Cake to Jacksonville.
During the first week of their marriage, Tea Cake and Janie encounter difficulties. He steals her money and leaves her alone one night, making her think that he married her only for her money. But he returns, explaining that he never meant to leave her and that his theft occurred in a moment of weakness. Afterward, they promise to share all their experiences and opinions with each other. They move to the Everglades, where they work during the harvest season and socialize during the summer off-season. Tea Cake’s quick wit and friendliness make their shack the center of entertainment and social life.
A terrible hurricane bursts into the Everglades two years after Janie and Tea Cake’s marriage. As they desperately flee the rising waters, a rabid dog bites Tea Cake. At the time, Tea Cake doesn’t realize the dog’s condition; three weeks later, however, he falls ill. During a rabies--induced bout of madness, Tea Cake becomes convinced that Janie is cheating on him. He starts firing a pistol at her and Janie is forced to kill him to save her life. She is immediately put on trial for murder, but the all-white, all-male jury finds her not guilty. She returns to Eatonville where her former neighbors are ready to spin malicious gossip about her circumstances, assuming that Tea Cake has left her and taken her money. Janie wraps up her recounting to Pheoby, who is greatly impressed by Janie’s experiences. Back in her room that night, Janie feels at one with Tea Cake and at peace with herself."
Thrones,"A Game of Thrones takes place over the course of one year on or near the fictional continent of Westeros. The story begins when King Robert visits the northern castle Winterfell to ask Ned Stark to be his right-hand assistant, or Hand of the King. The previous Hand, Jon Arryn, died under suspicious circumstances. Robert comes with his queen, Cersei Lannister, and his retinue, which includes a number of Lannisters. Just after the royal party arrives, Ned’s wife, Catelyn, receives a message claiming that the Lannister family was responsible for the death of the former Hand. She tells Ned, who accepts the position as Hand in order to protect Robert from the Lannisters. Ned’s son Bran then discovers Cersei Lannister and her brother Jaime Lannister having sex, and Jaime pushes Bran from a window to silence him. Everyone thinks Bran simply fell while climbing around the castle.
While Bran is still unconscious, Ned leaves Winterfell and rides south with Robert. The same day, Ned’s bastard son, Jon, leaves to serve at the Wall, a massive structure that protects Westeros from the wilderness of the far North. The group of men sworn to defend the Wall, the Night’s Watch, have been receiving reports of strange creatures and have been losing men with increasing frequency. Tyrion Lannister, a little person who is brother to Cersei and Jaime, travels with Jon to the Wall to see the massive structure. Meanwhile, on a continent east of Westeros, Daenerys Targaryen marries the warlord Khal Drogo, one of the leaders of the Dothraki people. Daenerys and her brother Viserys are the last surviving members of the family Robert defeated to become king, the Targaryens. They are an old family said to be descended from dragons, and Viserys thinks with Khal Drogo’s army he can retake the throne. A knight named Ser Jorah Mormont, exiled by Ned Stark, pledges he will help. Daenerys receives three dragon eggs as a wedding gift and becomes immediately fascinated by them.
On the trip south to the capital, called King’s Landing, Robert and Cersei’s son, Joffrey, and Ned’s daughter Sansa, who everyone presumes will be married one day, go for a walk. When Joffrey sees Arya, Ned’s other daughter and sister to Sansa, practicing her swordfighting with a boy, he decides to show them he’s a better fighter. As pets, all of the Stark children have direwolf pups, a wolf breed larger than normal wolves that also happens to be the symbol of the Stark house, and Arya’s wolf injures Joffrey defending her. Though Sansa knows Joffrey instigated the fight, she will not tell on Joffrey because she’s in love with him. As punishment, Cersei wants Arya’s wolf killed, but since it ran away after hurting Joffrey, Cersei demands that Ned kill Sansa’s wolf instead. Meanwhile, an assassin tries to kill the unconscious Bran and fails. Ned finally reaches King’s Landing to find that Catelyn has sailed to the city in secret to discover the truth about the assassin. She has the dagger the assassin used, and after examining it, Catelyn’s childhood friend Littlefinger recognizes it as belonging to Tyrion Lannister. Ned tells Catelyn he will try to determine who killed the former Hand, Jon Arryn, and who tried to kill Bran. Bran finally wakes from his coma, but he doesn’t remember how he fell. Tyrion visits him on his way south from the Wall to deliver a greeting from Jon. Tyrion continues south as Catelyn starts back north, and when their paths cross Catelyn has him seized for trying to kill Bran.
In King’s Landing, Ned slowly begins to unravel the mystery of why the previous Hand was killed. He knows it has to do with something the Hand learned about King Robert’s children. Through a spy, Robert learns that Daenerys Targaryen is pregnant. He wants to assassinate her because he fears she and her son will one day challenge Robert’s right to the throne. Disgusted with Robert’s plan, Ned resigns as Hand. That night, Jaime and his men confront Ned about Tyrion’s capture. Jaime kills Ned’s men and Ned breaks his leg while fighting. The following day, Robert reinstates Ned as Hand. While Robert is gone hunting, Ned orders the execution of a rogue knight loyal to the Lannister family who has been pillaging villages. Further north, Catelyn takes Tyrion to her sister Lysa Arryn’s castle, the Eyrie, which is in a mountainous area called The Vale. Lysa accuses Tyrion of arranging the murder of both Jon Arryn and Bran. Tyrion denies the accusations and demands a trial by combat. A knight fights on Lysa’s behalf, and a mercenary fights on Tyrion’s behalf. Tyrion’s mercenary wins. While Tyrion rides from the Eyrie, a group of mountain clansmen try to kill him, but he promises to help them take The Vale and convinces them to join him.
In the east, as Khal Drogo and his Dothraki followers head back to Vaes Dothrak, their capital, Viserys becomes increasingly angry that Drogo has not provided him with an army with which to wage war on Westeros. During a feast he attacks Daenerys in a rage, and Khal Drogo has Viserys killed by dumping molten gold on his head. In King’s Landing, Ned has figured out why the Hand was killed: he had discovered that Joffrey was not really Robert’s child but was actually the product of Cersei’s sexual relationship with her brother, Jaime. Robert doesn’t know the truth. Robert is mortally wounded in a hunt, and before he dies, he names Ned the Protector of the Realm, essentially an interim king, until Joffrey comes of age. Ned does not tell Robert that he knows Joffrey is not the true heir, since he is the son of Cersei and Jaime. Ned asks Littlefinger’s help to install the true heir, Robert’s brother Stannis, as the king, and Littlefinger agrees. But when Ned confronts the Lannisters, saying that Joffrey is not the true heir and expecting Littlefinger’s support, Littlefinger betrays him, and Cersei imprisons Ned for treason. Meanwhile, north of the Wall, Jon and other men have discovered two strange dead bodies. They bring the bodies back for examination, and late at night, one of the bodies comes to life and tries to kill Jon’s commander. Jon and his direwolf fight off the undead body, and Jon kills the creature with fire.
After Ned’s capture, Arya escapes the castle in King’s Landing and Cersei holds Sansa hostage (she says she is holding Sansa for her own protection). Tywin Lannister, father to Tyrion, Cersei, and Jaime, wages war with Catelyn and her son, Robb Stark. Shrewdly outmaneuvering Tywin, Robb manages to defeat a portion of the Lannister army and capture Jaime. In King’s Landing, Joffrey, who is considered Robert’s heir, is crowned King. In the hopes that he can prevent his daughters being harmed, Ned confesses publicly to treason, and Joffrey has him executed while Sansa watches. Arya is in the crowd, though nobody knows it.
Learning of his father’s death and his brother’s march to war, Jon tries to desert the Wall. Jon’s friends convince him that he must stay and defend the Wall as he vowed. In the east, Drogo suffers a wound while raiding a village. Daenerys has one of the village women treat him, but he becomes very sick. When he is about to die, Daenerys asks the woman to heal him, but she says only bloodmagic will save him and it will require a death in exchange for his life. Despite the protests of the Dothraki people, Daenerys has the woman do it. Shortly thereafter Daenerys goes into labor. When she wakes many days later, her child is dead and Drogo is alive but brain dead. His followers have all left, leaving behind only a few warriors, the sick and old, and Ser Jorah Mormont, who has become one of Daenerys’s most trusted advisors. Daenerys sets a funeral pyre to burn Drogo and the woman, who tricked her and essentially killed her husband and child. Daenerys also places the three dragon eggs into the pyre. As the fire burns, Daenerys walks into it, and when finally it clears, Mormont and the Dothrakis find her with three newborn dragons at her breast."
Commitments,"Lawyer Bryan Stevenson gives a first-person account of his decades helping marginalized Americans who have been unfairly and harshly punished by the U.S. criminal justice system, which disproportionately targets people of color and poor people. At the heart of Just Mercy is the story of Walter McMillian, a Black man who was framed for the murder of a girl named Ronda Morrison, convicted, and sent to death row. 
Stevenson alternates chapters about Walter with his personal reflections on our country’s history with racial disparity and issues around incarceration. Stevenson highlights other groups of vulnerable people who have been victimized by the criminal justice system and shares the stories of the prisoners he has helped over the years. The book also follows the growth of Stevenson’s nonprofit law project, the Alabama-based Equal Justice Initiative (EJI), through its expansion from focusing on death row prisoners to helping people sentenced to life without parole. Stevenson chronicles how EJI becomes a significant force in criminal justice reform.
In 1983 as a law student, Stevenson discovers his life’s passion when he interns with the Georgia-based Southern Prisoners Defense Committee and meets his first death row prisoner. After graduation Stevenson accepts a job with the organization to represent poor prisoners, including those in Alabama who lack any public defender. He meets Walter McMillian on Alabama’s death row. Walter owns a successful business but also transgresses racial boundaries when he has an affair with a white woman. Soon after the affair becomes public, the woman’s friend, Ralph Myers, accuses Walter of committing the unsolved murder of Ronda Morrison, which has outraged the community. Law enforcement, including a racist sheriff and the district attorney, eagerly pounces on this accusation, overlooking Walter’s alibi and a lack of evidence. Instead, they actively force Ralph to stick with his story even when he tries to recant. They coerce other false witness testimonies, and—as revealed years later—actively suppress evidence.
After Stevenson and the team at EJI unsuccessfully appeal Walter’s conviction, they launch their own investigation of the crime and uncover new evidence. They find witnesses who can prove the witnesses against Walter lied as well as financial records that indicate that one of these witnesses was paid to give false testimony. Stevenson and his team also petition for and receive all records from Walter’s trial. However, their big break comes when they receive a phone call from Ralph, who now wants to make amends. Ralph admits to lying about Walter and says he was threatened by law enforcement. Stevenson wins a hearing for Walter where he can present his new evidence: Ralph’s testimony, which is confirmed by health care workers and other inmates, as well as recordings of the law enforcement team threatening Ralph if he doesn’t frame Walter. 
While the judge refuses to grant Walter relief, Stevenson continues the appeal process through the Alabama courts. The district attorney asks outside agents to investigate the murder for which Walter was convicted, and the investigators determine that Walter had nothing to do with the crime. Six weeks later, the court invalidates Walter’s conviction. Stevenson and the State file a joint motion to dismiss the charges, and Walter is set free.
Throughout the process, Stevenson and Walter become close friends, and Stevenson helps Walter upon his release, including filing a civil suit on his behalf and offering him a place to stay. Walter works with Stevenson to share his story, giving interviews and speaking at legal conferences, and Walter is even featured in a documentary. Unfortunately, Walter is diagnosed with advancing dementia and is forced to rely on family and eventually a nursing facility for his care. He dies in 2013. Stevenson gives a eulogy at his funeral and shares all he learned from Walter, particularly that we must extend mercy to everyone, even those who have not earned it.
Interspersed with chapters chronicling Walter’s narrative are stories of Stevenson’s other clients and work. His closeness with these prisoners and their horrifying circumstances makes Stevenson more determined to help and causes him to reflect on abstract issues that nevertheless imbue the criminal justice system, like humanity and mercy. Stevenson focuses on several categories of vulnerable people who become trapped in the system, including mentally ill prisoners, disabled prisoners, and poor women who give birth to stillborn babies. 
Stevenson and his team at EJI also become increasingly focused on juvenile offenders who are sometimes tried as adults despite their young age. These offenders may be given de facto death sentences by being sentenced to life without parole and face perilous circumstances when they are housed in adult prisons. Stevenson illustrates how these prisoners retain their own humanity while being forced to live under inhumane conditions. He also discusses some of the qualities common among these types of prisoners: They are generally poor and disproportionately people of color, and most of them lack adequate legal counsel. The juveniles have horrific backgrounds of abuse and neglect.
Stevenson and his team at EJI also work to change the legal system to offer more protection to marginalized people. Several of his cases end up before the U.S. Supreme Court, and he succeeds in winning rulings that ban as unconstitutional the conviction of children to life without parole and the execution of people deemed incompetent from dementia or neurological disease. EJI works to raise public awareness of issues surrounding unfair incarceration, produces groundbreaking reports on racial issues, and sets up programs to help formerly incarcerated people adjust to life on the outside.
Stevenson also reflects on the issues that surround the criminal justice system. His time spent with prisoners awaiting their execution makes him realize how inhumane it is to prepare another human to die. After decades of work, when Stevenson fails to prevent the execution of a man who suffers from an intellectual disability, he momentarily feels unable to continue his work. However, he realizes that he cannot help but be broken by his experiences and comes to understand that it is his own brokenness that allows him to more fully understand the need for mercy and to bring compassion to others. The book ends with Stevenson’s renewed commitment to helping others."
Induced,"The protagonist, who is named Tim O’Brien, begins by describing an event that occurred in the middle of his Vietnam experience. “The Things They Carried” catalogs the variety of things his fellow soldiers in the Alpha Company brought on their missions. Several of these things are intangible, including guilt and fear, while others are specific physical objects, including matches, morphine, M-16 rifles, and M&M’s candy.
Throughout the collection, the same characters reappear in various stories. The first member of the Alpha Company to die is Ted Lavender, a “grunt,” or low-ranking soldier, who deals with his anxiety about the war by taking tranquilizers and smoking marijuana. Lavender is shot in the head on his way back from going to the bathroom, and his superior, Lieutenant Jimmy Cross, blames himself for the tragedy. When Lavender is shot, Cross is distracting himself with thoughts of Martha, a college crush. It is revealed in “Love” that Cross’s feelings for Martha, whom he dated once before leaving for Vietnam, were never reciprocated, and that even twenty years after the war, his guilt over Lavender’s death remains.
In “On the Rainy River,” the narrator, O’Brien, explains the series of events that led him to Vietnam in the first place. He receives his draft notice in June of 1968, and his feelings of confusion drive him north to the Canadian border, which he contemplates crossing so that he will not be forced to fight in a war in which he doesn’t believe. Sitting in a rowboat with the proprietor of the Tip Top Lodge, where he stays, O’Brien decides that his guilt about avoiding the war and fear of disappointing his family are more important than his political convictions. He soon leaves, going first back home to Worthington, Minnesota and later to Vietnam.
In addition to Ted Lavender, a few other members of the Alpha Company are killed during their mission overseas, including Curt Lemon, who is killed when he steps on a rigged mortar round. Though O’Brien is not close to Lemon, in “The Dentist,” he tells a story of how Lemon, who faints before a routine checkup with an army-issued dentist, tries to save face by insisting that a perfectly good tooth be pulled. Lee Strunk, another member of the company, dies from injuries he sustains by stepping on a landmine. In “Friends,” O’Brien remembers that before Strunk was fatally hurt, Strunk and Dave Jensen had made a pact that if either man were irreparably harmed, the other man would see that he was quickly killed. However, when Strunk is actually hurt, he begs Jensen to spare him, and Jensen complies. Instead of being upset by the news of his friend’s swift death en route to treatment, Jensen is relieved.
The death that receives the most attention in The Things They Carried is that of Kiowa, a much-loved member of the Alpha Company and one of O’Brien’s closest friends. In “Speaking of Courage,” the story of Kiowa’s death is relayed in retrospect through the memory of Norman Bowker, years after the war. As Bowker drives around a lake in his Iowa hometown, he thinks that he failed to save Kiowa, who was killed when a mortar round hit and caused him to sink headfirst into a marshy field. O’Brien realizes that he has dealt with his guilt over Kiowa’s death differently than Norman Bowker in “Notes.” Just before the end of the war, O’Brien receives a long letter from Bowker that says he hasn’t found a way to make life meaningful after the war. O’Brien resolves to tell Bowker’s story, and the story of Kiowa’s death, in order to negotiate his own feelings of guilt and hollowness.
Like “Love” and “Notes,” several of O’Brien’s stories are told from a perspective twenty years after the Vietnam War, when he is a forty-three-year-old writer living in Massachusetts. Exposure to the guilt of old friends like Jimmy Cross and Norman Bowker prompts him to write stories in order to understand what they were going through. But two stories, “The Man I Killed” and “Ambush,” are written so that O’Brien can confront his own guilt over killing a man with a grenade outside the village of My Khe. In “The Man I Killed,” O’Brien imagines the life of his victim, from his childhood to the way things would have turned out for him had O’Brien not spotted him on a path and thrown a grenade at his feet. In “Ambush,” O’Brien imagines how he might relay the story of the man he killed to his nine-year-old daughter, Kathleen. In this second story, O’Brien provides more details of the actual killing—including the sound of the grenade and his own feelings—and explains that even well after the fact, he hasn’t finished sorting out the experience.
In the last story, “The Lives of the Dead,” O’Brien gives another twist to his contention that stories have the power to save people. In the stories of Curt Lemon and Kiowa, O’Brien explains that his imagination allowed him to grapple successfully with his guilt and confusion over the death of his fourth-grade first love, Linda."

Arts,"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man tells the story of Stephen Dedalus, a boy growing up in Ireland at the end of the nineteenth century, as he gradually decides to cast off all his social, familial, and religious constraints to live a life devoted to the art of writing. As a young boy, Stephen's Catholic faith and Irish nationality heavily influence him. He attends a strict religious boarding school called Clongowes Wood College. At first, Stephen is lonely and homesick at the school, but as time passes he finds his place among the other boys. He enjoys his visits home, even though family tensions run high after the death of the Irish political leader Charles Stewart Parnell. This sensitive subject becomes the topic of a furious, politically charged argument over the family's Christmas dinner.
Stephen's father, Simon, is inept with money, and the family sinks deeper and deeper into debt. After a summer spent in the company of his Uncle Charles, Stephen learns that the family cannot afford to send him back to Clongowes, and that they will instead move to Dublin. Stephen starts attending a prestigious day school called Belvedere, where he grows to excel as a writer and as an actor in the student theater. His first sexual experience, with a young Dublin prostitute, unleashes a storm of guilt and shame in Stephen, as he tries to reconcile his physical desires with the stern Catholic morality of his surroundings. For a while, he ignores his religious upbringing, throwing himself with debauched abandon into a variety of sins—masturbation, gluttony, and more visits to prostitutes, among others. Then, on a three-day religious retreat, Stephen hears a trio of fiery sermons about sin, judgment, and hell. Deeply shaken, the young man resolves to rededicate himself to a life of Christian piety.
Stephen begins attending Mass every day, becoming a model of Catholic piety, abstinence, and self-denial. His religious devotion is so pronounced that the director of his school asks him to consider entering the priesthood. After briefly considering the offer, Stephen realizes that the austerity of the priestly life is utterly incompatible with his love for sensual beauty. That day, Stephen learns from his sister that the family will be moving, once again for financial reasons. Anxiously awaiting news about his acceptance to the university, Stephen goes for a walk on the beach, where he observes a young girl wading in the tide. He is struck by her beauty, and realizes, in a moment of epiphany, that the love and desire of beauty should not be a source of shame. Stephen resolves to live his life to the fullest, and vows not to be constrained by the boundaries of his family, his nation, and his religion.
Stephen moves on to the university, where he develops a number of strong friendships, and is especially close with a young man named Cranly. In a series of conversations with his companions, Stephen works to formulate his theories about art. While he is dependent on his friends as listeners, he is also determined to create an independent existence, liberated from the expectations of friends and family. He becomes more and more determined to free himself from all limiting pressures, and eventually decides to leave Ireland to escape them. Like his namesake, the mythical Daedalus, Stephen hopes to build himself wings on which he can fly above all obstacles and achieve a life as an artist."
Perpetual,"The Unbearable Lightness of Being opens with a philosophical discussion of lightness versus heaviness. Kundera contrasts Nietzsche's philosophy of eternal return, or of heaviness, with Parmenides's understanding of life as light. Kundera wonders if any meaning or weight can be attributed to life, since there is no eternal return: if man only has the opportunity to try one path, to make one decision, he cannot return to take a different path, and then compare the two lives. Without the ability to co mpare lives, Kundera argues, we cannot find meaning; where meaning should exist we find only an unbearable weightlessness. The uncertain existence of meaning, and the opposition of lightness and heaviness, the key dichotomy of The Unbearable Lightness of Being, sets the stage for the entire novel.
The year is 1968. The protagonist, Tomas, a brilliant Prague surgeon, pursues a philosophy of lightness in his erotic adventures and exploits. Briefly married in the past, he neither sees nor wishes to see his ex-wife or young son and is comfortably established as a perpetual bachelor. He meets Tereza, a café waitress in a town he visits, and realizes when she follows him to Prague that she intends to ""offer him up her life."" A determined libertine, he momentarily resists his budding roma ntic feelings for her, then gives in to his love.
Tereza had been living a frustrated life as a waitress in a small town, and dreamed of escaping, especially from her vulgar mother. She recognizes in Tomas an intellectual and dreamer, and falls in love with him instantly. The two live together, but Tomas is unable to give up his mistresses. For a while he hides his infidelity from Teresa. Eventually he admits to it, but claims that his sexuality is entirely separate from his love for her. Tereza, unable to accept his behavior or adopt a light attitud e towards sex, suffers increasingly from nightmares, and contemplates suicide.
To keep Tereza happy, Tomas marries her. He keeps his mistresses, however, including his closest friend and long-term lover Sabina, a beautiful, reckless, and talented painter. In spite of herself, Tereza is charmed by Sabina's openness and light-heartedness, and the two women grow friendly. Sabina finds Tereza a job in Prague as a photographer. Despite her friendship with Sabina, however, Tereza's jealousy of Tomas does not slacken.
The events of the Prague Spring result in the Soviet military occupation of the city. Tomas, who in the past wrote an article condemning the Czech Communists, is warned to leave. Sabina flees first, and later Tomas and Tereza join her in Switzerland. Tereza, who found some fulfillment in her job as photographer in Prague, realizes that in Zurich she is jobless and must sit at home while Tomas continues having affairs. She decides that ""when the strong were too weak to hurt the weak, the weak had to be strong enough to leave,"" and returns to Prague. Tomas attempts to enjoy his newly recovered freedom for a few days, then gives up and returns to Prague and Tereza. The return truly means giving up freedom—there is no chance that the couple will be allo wed to leave again. In Prague, Tomas's political troubles escalate. He loses his position as surgeon for refusing to sign a denunciation of his anti-Communist article. Both the Communist regime and underground dissidents attempt to seduce him to their side. His own son reappears as a young dissident and preaches to Tomas with no success, for Tomas hates the idea of being used politically in the same way Sabina hates artistic kitsch. In the end, Tomas seeks obscurity in a job washing windows. His fame persists, however, and he continues seducing the women he works for.
Tereza, now a bartender, in a moment of desperation has an affair with a tall engineer who comes to her bar. She does so in hopes of coming closer to Tomas's way of life; instead she grows more miserable and becomes convinced the man was a police agent hired to gather potential blackmailing material. After many scenes and nightmares, she convinces Tomas to move with her to the country. This means giving up their way of life entirely, and an end to Tomas's erotic adventures.
After living peacefully in the country for some time, Tomas and Tereza are killed one night in a driving accident; they die instantly and together.
In Geneva, Sabina has a love affair with Franz, a university professor and idealistic intellectual who has more in common emotionally with Tereza than Sabina—he imbues his life with heavy meaning. He views Sabina as a romantic and courageous Czech dissident, and is tortured that he must betray his wife Marie-Claude in order to see her. Sabina loves Franz but their views on betrayal differ dramatically; whereas he hates the idea of betrayal, she views betrayal as the first step towards ""going off into the unknown,"" the most glorious thing she can think of.
When Franz leaves his wife and expects to move in with her, Sabina abruptly leaves Switzerland. Sabina leaves Geneva for Paris and then Paris for America; she learns of Tomas and Tereza's deaths from a letter and understands her last link to the past has been broken. She ends up living with an elderly American couple and wondering if she has reached the end of her perpetual flight.
Franz remains separated from his wife. After Sabina's betrayal, he finds consolation with a young student, a girl in over-sized glasses who loves him simply. Franz never accepts that he clearly misunderstood Sabina, but continues to hold her image as in ideal in his head, (wrongly) thinking his decisions in life would have made her proud. At his death, his wife reclaims Franz's body and orders the words ""A return after long wanderings"" written on his tombstone."
Look,"Looking for Alaska tells the story of Miles “Pudge” Halter, a high school junior who divides his life into time before and time after a life-changing event that the reader will not discover until later in the novel. 
Miles plans to attend the Culver Creek boarding school for his junior year of high school. Although his parents worry that Miles wants to attend the school because he does not have friends at his current school, Miles reveals that he is actually influenced by the last words of the poet François Rabelais about “seeking the Great Perhaps.” He moves to Birmingham, Alabama to attend Culver Creek and becomes friends with his roommate, Chip “The Colonel” Martin. Chip teaches Miles about the social structure of the school. He explains that the wealthy students that go home to their parents’ mansions every weekend (the “Weekday Warriors”) do not get along with his friend group. 
Chip introduces Miles to his friend Alaska, and Miles is quickly enamored by her. While Miles is obsessed with people’s final words and wants to seek François Rabelais’s “Great Perhaps,” Alaska enjoys books and wants to know the nature of “the labyrinth of suffering” that Simón Bolívar evoked in his final words.
The Weekday Warriors sneak into Chip and Miles’s dorm on Miles’s first night and throw Miles into the lake with his limbs bound by tape. Chip and Miles discover that this action was taken in retaliation for Chip supposedly ratting out their friends—a couple named Marya and Paul—and getting them expelled the previous year. Miles, Chip, Alaska, and another friend, Takumi, begin planning a revenge prank. Miles becomes part of their friend group and starts smoking cigarettes. The four of them get caught smoking and Alaska and Chip cover for Miles and Takumi, demonstrating to Miles that you cover for your friends instead of ratting them out. 
Miles settles into his new school and does well in his classes because he spends so much time studying. Alaska decides she will find Miles a girlfriend, and eventually introduces him to a Romanian student named Lara. Miles embarrasses himself on the first group date at a basketball game with Alaska, Alaska’s boyfriend Jake, Chip, Chip’s girlfriend Sara, Takumi, and Lara. Miles is hit by a basketball, gets concussed, and then vomits on Lara. Afterward, Miles tries to talk to Alaska, but is confused when Alaska becomes moody and short with him for no apparent reason.
The Weekday Warriors target Alaska with a prank, reminding Chip and Alaska they need to work on their own revenge prank. Takumi reveals to Miles that it was actually Alaska who ratted out the couple who were expelled the previous year. Takumi warns Miles that he cannot rat anyone else out if he gets caught carrying out the revenge prank. Miles is still infatuated with Alaska and asks his parents to let him stay at school over Thanksgiving break so he can be with her. Although he knows she has a boyfriend, Miles wants to be with Alaska. They ultimately spend Thanksgiving Day with Chip and his mom.
Lara joins Alaska, Chip, Takumi, and Miles as they execute their revenge prank on the Weekday Warriors. They set off fireworks and put dye in the Weekday Warriors’ hair products. They also get on the computer of the Dean (whom they call “the Eagle”) to send bad grade reports to the parents of the Weekday Warriors. The five of them spend the remainder of the night and weekend camping and hiding in a barn on campus as their alibi is that they were all off campus. They play a drinking game and Alaska reveals that, as a child, she saw her mom die of an aneurysm and did not call an ambulance because she thought her mom was just sleeping. When they quit playing the drinking game, Miles kisses Lara. He asks if she wants to be his girlfriend and she says yes. 
Miles spends time with Lara despite not having much to talk about, but they are physically intimate. He leaves Lara to spend time with Alaska and Chip in his room, watching them as they get drunk. Alaska dares Miles to make out with her. He does and she tells him it is to be continued in the future. They all go to sleep. Chip and Miles are startled awake later by Alaska frantically telling them she needs to leave because she had forgotten something. They provide a distraction for the Eagle so she can get in her car and drive away unnoticed.
The Eagle calls an assembly to announce to the student body that Alaska has died. Miles asks what happened and is informed that she drove straight into a police cruiser with its lights and sirens on, likely due to driving while intoxicated. Both Chip and Miles feel responsible for her death because they helped her drive away when they knew she was drunk. They mourn in different ways and attend Alaska’s funeral.
Miles and Chip go through Alaska’s room to see if there is anything they want to keep. They find a note she wrote in one of her books that said “straight and fast” was the way out of the labyrinth of suffering. This revelation makes Chip and Miles think she may have killed herself. Chip is eager to investigate her death and Miles reluctantly agrees to help. 
Religion class becomes more important to Miles after Alaska’s death because its subject matter becomes more real. Chip and Miles vent their anger to each other that so many people who did not know Alaska like they did are mourning her death. Chip leads their investigation into Alaska’s death. 
Chip and Miles interview the police officer who saw Alaska crash. Their interview supports their belief that she killed herself, so they research suicide warning signs. They do not remember Alaska exhibiting many of the warning signs and continue their investigation. Meanwhile, Miles avoids Lara. Takumi questions Miles about whether he is still dating Lara, and Takumi demands that Chip and Miles tell him about what they have been doing. They agree to tell him about their investigation in the future. 
Chip plans to see if Alaska might have been unable to swerve because of how drunk she was. He and Miles steal a breathalyzer from the Eagle and Chip drinks enough alcohol to match Alaska’s blood alcohol level at her time of death. He believes she would have been able to swerve, so he plans to call Jake, Alaska’s boyfriend, as a final effort. Miles is against calling Jake, but Chip does it anyway. They learn that Alaska told Jake that she would call him later, which further confuses the question of whether she killed herself or not.
Chip and Miles do not know what to investigate next, so they turn their attention to planning a prank in memory of Alaska. Chip pulls out plans Alaska had made for a prank, and Chip and Miles recruit other juniors at the school to execute it. They hire a male stripper, posing as a psychologist, to give a presentation at a Speaker’s Day event at their school. He delivers a speech about subverting the patriarchal paradigm and performs in front of the whole student body. 
Later in the year, Takumi points out to Chip and Miles that the date of Alaska’s death coincides with the date of the story Alaska shared with them about her mother’s death when they played a drinking game in the barn. The boys realize she must have forgotten the anniversary of her mother’s death and was driving to her grave to deliver flowers. Although they still feel guilty for helping her drive away drunk, and they do not know for sure whether it was an accident or suicide, they feel like they now have the closure they needed. 
“Straight and fast” was Alaska’s way out of the labyrinth of suffering, but Miles decides to choose the labyrinth over an escape. Miles feels more confident about seeking the Great Perhaps, despite the grief he experienced by loving and losing Alaska."
Estimated,"Nisa opens with an introduction by Shostak, detailing her own preparations and expectations for her first trip to the Dobe region of Africa, in northwest Botswana and at the edge of the Kalahari Desert. Shostak describes Nisa’s people, the Zhun/twasi (“real people”), bushmen who are hunter-gatherers and members of a racial group known as Khoisan. The Khoisan are considered by biologists to be distinct from black Africans, with fair skin, high cheekbones, and an average height of only about five feet.
Shostak narrates from a position in the present, reflecting back on her experiences in Africa. (Nisa, too, tells her stories in the past tense.) In the introduction, Shostak says that her motivation for coming to Africa was primarily to learn about the internal lives of the !Kung people, whose more easily discernable qualities (such as diet, life cycle, and demographics) had already been studied by other anthropologists for years. She and her husband join in the ongoing research, Shostak feeling particularly inclined to study the women of the !Kung tribe. She learns the language and interviews a number of women, but it is Nisa who captures her attention most. Nisa answers Shostak’s questions with colorful language and vivid stories. After a few interviews, Nisa tells Shostak that her mother wanted to kill Nisa’s younger brother right after he was born so that Nisa could continue to nurse. Shostak is taken aback and starts to doubt Nisa’s truthfulness, but she eventually comes to trust her.
The rest of the book is divided into fifteen chapters, one for each of the interviews Shostak has with Nisa during her first Dobe visit, plus an epilogue. Each chapter opens with an overview by Shostak on the topic, theme, stage of life, or experience Nisa is about to narrate. In these introductions, Shostak draws from interviews with other !Kung men and women, work done by other anthropologists, her own observations and analyses, and historical and geographical contexts.
In Chapter 1, Nisa describes her early memories of accompanying her pregnant mother as she gives birth to Nisa’s baby brother, Kumsa, and threatens to kill him, though she does not actually commit infanticide. In Chapter 2, Nisa recalls growing up with her brother, playing with him, experiencing sibling hatred, and protecting him from harm. She remembers her mother’s pregnancy with her fourth child, Kxamshe, who dies young. In Chapter 3, Nisa describes the life of a hunter-gatherer, hunting prey, celebrating the arrival of meat in the village, gathering roots and bulbs, experiencing thirst in times of drought, and gorging on caterpillars in times of rain.
In Chapter 4, Nisa remembers what it was like to engage in sex play with other children in the village for the first time, and she recalls some of the boys’ sexual aggression toward her and other girls. She notes that parents and children sleep in the same hut, so that the children become aware of what their parents are doing when they move under the blankets. In Chapter 5, Nisa tells Shostak about her first two marriages, one to a man named Bo, the other to a man named Tsaa. Both marriages end quickly, as is typical of early “trial” marriages in !Kung society. Nisa also describes her feelings of love for a man named Kantla, who is already married and who invites her to be a co-wife, an offer that Nisa refuses.
In Chapter 6, Nisa enters her first long marriage, to a man named Tashay. She and Tashay grow to love each other. Early in their marriage, Nisa experiences her first menstruation, and the women of the village enclose her in a hut and perform the ritual ceremonies that accompany that momentous event in a !Kung woman’s life. Chapter 7 concerns the infrequent though not uncommon practice of adopting a co-wife. Nisa tells of her own brief experience with a co-wife Tashay brings to the hut. Before long, Nisa drives the co-wife away and the marriage resumes as normal.
Nisa takes on several lovers, as is common in !Kung society, and when she becomes pregnant, as recounted in Chapter 8, her husband gets very jealous. He accuses her of infidelity and questions the baby’s paternity. Nisa gives birth to a baby girl, Chuko, who dies in infancy. In Chapter 9, Nisa describes her four subsequent pregnancies. She has a baby girl, Nai, then miscarries, then has another girl who dies young, and then has a son, Kxau.
Chapter 10 begins with Shostak’s observations of the !Kung’s changing environment and way of life, which have been increasingly influenced by neighboring cattle-herding groups, the Tswana and the Herero. Nisa then discusses her marriage to a Tswana man named Besa, as well as the complications of her several love affairs with other men. In Chapter 11, Nisa travels from the Tswana village back to her parents’ village after learning her father has died. Soon after, her mother dies, and Nisa herself falls ill but is cured by her elder brother, Dau, who is a healer. Nisa begins working in the house of a European woman who lives near their village. She also becomes pregnant with Besa’s child but miscarries. In Chapter 12, Nisa continues to tell Shostak about her many lovers and also recalls being a child and seeing her mother with her lover and telling her father about her mother’s affair. She also explains to Shostak that the !Kung women talk freely with each other about sex, and she asks Shostak if that isn’t the same with all women.
Chapter 13 deals with the !Kung belief in the spirit world and, in particular, with the role spirits are thought to play in illness and healing. Nisa describes her father’s and older brother’s healing abilities. She also tells Shostak about how her mother taught her to go into a trance and about her own once-potent capabilities as a healer. In Chapter 14, Nisa painfully recounts the deaths of her two last surviving children. Nai dies after being shoved by her husband, and Kxau succumbs to serious illness after eating honey that the spirits have designated for the honey badger. In Chapter 15, Nisa expresses hurt over the fact that her husband no longer wants to sleep with her very often, and she says she feels she has grown ugly. She mentions that she has been through menopause and asks Shostak for medicine to bring back her menses.
The epilogue briefly describes Shostak’s return to Dobe in 1975, when she, her husband, and a graduate student conduct a research study on women’s menstrual cycles. She also meets with Nisa and interviews her again. She finds Nisa to be calm and in good spirits, and Nisa agrees when Shostak asks if it would be all right to publish the interviews as a book."
Vindicated,"The novel’s protagonist and narrator, Salim, grew up in a community of ethnically Indian Muslims on the east African coast. As the novel opens, Salim explains how he came to leave his coastal home and move to an unnamed country in the African interior. Worried that the trend of political independence sweeping the continent would scatter his home community, Salim sought a way out. When a family friend named Nazruddin returned to the coast after several years in the interior, he offered to sell Salim his trading goods shop. Salim took Nazruddin up on his offer and drove to his new home: a former colonial town located at the bend in a major river.
Salim found the town decrepit and scattered with vestiges of empire that local Africans had destroyed in retaliation against their longstanding colonial oppressor. Only a few Europeans remained, and most Africans had returned to their villages in the bush. Not long after Salim’s arrival in the interior, an uprising devastated the Indian community on the coast. News of the persecutions vindicated Salim’s decision to relocate. In the midst of the uprising, Salim’s family sent a half-African former slave named Metty to serve as Salim’s shop assistant.
Salim’s modest shop traded in basic household goods, and his first customer was an African trader named Zabeth, locally renowned as a sorceress. Zabeth wanted her son, Ferdinand, to get a formal education, so she sent him to attend the secondary school in the town and asked Salim to watch over him. A Belgian priest named Father Huismans ran the school. Though Huismans believed in European superiority, African religions fascinated him, and he maintained a collection of wooden masks.
Just as life in the town began to pick up, rebel activity ignited in the bush. The President sent white mercenaries, and they swiftly quashed the rebellion. As peace set in again, Huismans was murdered while on an expedition in the bush. Soon after the murder, which nobody investigated, an American traveler stole the majority of Huismans’s mask collection.
Following the rebellion, the town experienced an economic boom, and it once again became a regional trading center. In the midst of the boom, the President commandeered a section of land near the town that had once been a European suburb but had since reverted to bush. On the large plot, now deemed a “Domain of the State,” the President commissioned the construction of modern-looking buildings that would comprise a new polytechnic university. The people in the town, however, remained largely ignorant of what went on in the Domain, which seemed to them a world apart.
Lecturers and professors came from the capital and from abroad, including a childhood friend of Salim’s named Indar. Indar introduced Salim to the society of the Domain, which was full of European intellectuals and African students discussing “the new Africa.” Though stimulated by his experiences in the Domain, Salim felt conflicted about the place. The lofty discussions of African modernity clashed with the evidently shoddy construction of the buildings and an aborted farm project, already overgrown with unused tractors rusting in the field.
Among the people Salim met in the Domain were a historian named Raymond and his much younger wife, Yvette. Raymond was once the President’s mentor, and he remained loyal to the President despite falling out of the politician’s favor. Though Raymond’s progress on a monumental history of the country had stalled, he worked on editing a collection of the President’s speeches. But the President, evidently displeased with Raymond’s work, published and distributed a radically altered version of the book that only included brief maxims.
Meanwhile, Salim engaged in an affair with Yvette. For Salim, who had only previously slept with prostitutes, his intensely physical liaisons with Yvette proved reinvigorating. But as their relationship progressed, Salim grew uncomfortable with his connection to Yvette and the failures of her husband. Sensing that Yvette saw him as another version of Raymond, Salim attacked her. Their affair fizzled out.
When a prominent business owner suddenly sold off his assets and left town, Salim and others understood the event as marking the end of the town’s boom. Soon after, political unrest began to grow. The President established a Youth Guard to help maintain order, but he disbanded the group when members started abusing their power. Presumably humiliated by the President’s denunciation, former Youth Guard members formed a Liberation Army, which publicly proclaimed its rejection of the President and his vision of a new Africa.
Increasing violence perpetrated by the Liberation Army led Salim to seek a way out of the country. He decided to travel to London to visit Nazruddin. During his visit, Salim learned about Nazruddin’s disastrous business ventures in Canada and his troubles in London. Salim also felt disenchanted to see so many people “like him” struggling to survive. The experience made him realize the need to reject false ideals about home and security and instead live in the world as it was. Before he left London, Salim got engaged to Nazruddin’s daughter, Kareisha.
Upon returning to the town at the bend in the river, Salim learned that the President had ordered the nationalization of all foreign-owned businesses. An inexperienced and increasingly troublesome African named Théotime now owned the shop and kept Salim on as manager and chauffeur. Desperate to get out of the country for good, Salim started trading illegally in gold and ivory. On a tip from Metty, the police discovered Salim’s hidden cache of prohibited goods, and when Salim refused to pay a bribe, they arrested him.
After days in jail, the arresting officer escorted Salim to see the commissioner, who happened to be Zabeth’s son, Ferdinand. Ferdinand informed Salim that the political situation was deteriorating and counseled him to leave town as soon as possible. The next day, on the eve of the President’s arrival in the town, Salim boarded the steamer and left."
Upon,"Bri Jackson, the narrator of the novel, is a 16-year-old girl from Garden Heights, a predominantly Black inner-city neighborhood. Bri has her sights set on rap stardom, hoping to follow in the footsteps of her late father, the underground rap star Lawless. As the novel opens, Bri is nervously awaiting the phone call that could be her big break: an invitation to perform in the Ring, a local club where up-and-coming rappers face off in “battles.” But first, she must endure her ACT prep class at Midtown School of the Arts so she can get her confiscated phone back from her teacher. Bri’s two best friends from Garden Heights, Sonny and Malik, are in the class with her. Like many of the other students of color at Midtown Academy, they are bused in from less affluent neighborhoods. 
By the time Bri finally gets the call to battle at the Ring, both her teacher and her mother, Jay, have reminded her that school, not rap, is the key to her future. But Bri remains fixated on rap stardom as the solution to her family’s financial problems, especially after she learns that Jay, a recovering drug addict, has lost her job. Bri’s Aunt Pooh, a gang member and a drug dealer, escorts Bri to the battle at the Ring, where she squares off with Milez, another teen rapper. In the first round of the battle, Milez raps about Lawless’s murder, shocking Bri and causing her to freeze up when it is her turn to rap. But she soon recovers and outperforms Milez in the next two rounds, winning the battle decisively. By the following morning, a video of the battle is on YouTube and all Bri’s classmates are praising her for her skills.  
Bri’s celebration is short-lived, however. Tate and Long, two school security guards who have a reputation for targeting Black and Latinx students, single Bri out to have her bag searched. When Bri objects, they violently throw her to the ground and cuff her. Bri is suspended for having candy—which her principal refers to as ""contraband—in her backpack. The security guards are suspended too, pending an investigation, but rumors circulate around the school that Bri is a drug dealer.   
Angry about the assault and people’s racist assumptions about her, Bri writes and records a defiant song called “On the Come Up.” In the song, Bri rails against racist police and other authority figures. She also boasts about having a gun and being ready to use it—because that’s what people expect anyway—even though she barely knows anything about guns. Bri shares the recording with Supreme, her father’s old manager, who promises to make her famous. Supreme releases “On the Come Up” online, where it gets picked up by a Black gossip blog and goes viral. Many of Bri’s friends love the song, but Aunt Pooh, Malik, and Trey all chastise Bri for misrepresenting herself and rapping about gang violence that she has never taken part in.  
Real violence breaks out when Tate and Long are reinstated as the school security guards. Students of color protest outside the school while chanting some of the violent lyrics from “On the Come Up.” When Tate and Long warn them to stop, some students attack the security guards, and a riot ensues. A local news station reports that Bri’s song incited the violence. Jay sees the newscast, learns about Bri’s song for the first time, and insists that Bri stop rapping, lay low, and focus on school. Instead, Bri takes to Instagram and is interviewed by a local radio show, defiantly claiming on both platforms that she won’t be silenced. During the radio interview, Bri has to be restrained after DJ Hype insults her with sexist taunts. Bri begins to feel as though she’s becoming the violent person that others assume she is.  
Meanwhile, Bri’s family continues to struggle, falling behind on bills and rent. The electric company shuts off the power and the landlord threatens eviction. Jay quits school, setting aside her dreams so she can become eligible for food stamps. To make matters worse, the Crowns, a rival gang, rob Bri and Malik at gunpoint, taking her father’s gold chain. Aunt Pooh vows to get revenge on the Crowns and disappears for ten days. When she returns, Aunt Pooh is arrested in a drug bust and taken to jail while Bri looks on.  
With her family’s struggles in mind, Bri goes to a recording studio again, this time with Supreme. Supreme encourages Bri to embrace the persona of a “hoodlum” in her music because that is what people expect of Black rappers. He has another rapper write a song for Bri to record. Even though Bri does not agree with the lyrics, she reluctantly agrees to record the song, hoping to impress a white record executive.  
Bri returns to the Ring once more, where she is supposed to perform the song she recorded. Instead, Bri freestyles her own lyrics about refusing to be what people think she should be. The record executive angrily walks out, but the crowd goes wild. Later, an unnamed celebrity retweets the video of Bri’s freestyle and calls her the future of hip-hop. Bri decides that she will pursue a rap career, but only if she can do it on her own terms."
English,"In The English Patient, the past and the present are continually intertwined. The narrative structure intersperses descriptions of present action with thoughts and conversations that offer glimpses of past events and occurrences. Though there is no single narrator, the story is alternatively seen from the point of view of each of the main characters.
The novel opens with Hana, a young nurse, gardening outside a villa in Italy in 1945. The European theater of the war has just ended with the Germans retreating up the Italian countryside. As the Germans retreated, they left hidden bombs and mines everywhere, so the landscape is particularly dangerous. Although the other nurses and patients have left the villa to escape to a safer place, Hana decides to stay in the villa with her patient.
Hana does not know much about the man for whom she cares. Found in the wreckage of a plane crash, he been burned beyond recognition, his whole body black and even the slightest touch painful to him. He talks about the Bedouin tribe who found him in the wreckage, cared for his wounds, and eventually returned him to a British camp in 1944. He does not know who they were, but he feels grateful to them nonetheless. To pass the time, Hana reads to the English patient—she assumes he is English by his manner and speech—and also gardens, fixes up the villa, and plays hopscotch. Sometimes she picks up the patient's notebook, a copy of Herodotus's The Histories marked throughout with his own notes, figures, and observations, and reads to him or to herself.
One day, a man with bandaged hands named Caravaggio arrives at the villa. He is an old family friend of Hana's father, Patrick, and had heard about her location while he was recovering in a hospital a few miles away. In Canada, where Caravaggio knew Hana years ago, he was a thief. He tells her how his skills were legitimized in the war and how he put them to use working for British Intelligence in North Africa. He tells her that the Germans caught him after an attempt to steal a camera from a woman's room. They tortured him and cut off his thumbs, leaving his hands mutilated and nearly useless. Although he has recovered somewhat, he is still addicted to morphine. In the villa, he reminisces with Hana and mourns with her over the death of her father in the war.
As Hana plays the piano in the library, two soldiers come in and stand alongside while she plays. One of them is Kip, an Indian Sikh trained as a sapper, or bomb-defuser, in the British army. After hearing the piano, Kip has come to clear the villa of bombs, knowing that the Germans frequently booby-trapped musical instruments. Kip and the English patient get along very well, as they are both experts in guns and bombs and enjoy talking to each other and sharing stories. Kip makes camp in the garden of the villa and becomes a part of the ""family"" that now exists there. He goes off into town every day to clear more bombs from the area and to bury fellow sappers who have died. Kip's job is extremely dangerous. He feels a strong attraction to Hana, and soon they become lovers.
Asked about his past, the English patient begins to tell the others his story. His real name is Almasy, though this is not definitively confirmed until Chapter IX. He spent the years from 1930 to the start of World War II exploring the North African desert. His job was to make observations, draw maps, and search for ancient oases in the sands. Along with his fellow European counterparts, Almasy knew every inch of the desert and made many trips across it. In 1936, a young man from Oxford, Geoffrey Clifton, and his new wife Katharine, joined their party. Geoffrey owned a plane, which the party found especially useful in helping to map the desert. The explorers, Almasy, and the Cliftons got along very well. One night, after hearing Katharine read a passage from his book of Herodotus, Almasy realized he was in love with her. They soon began a torrid and tumultuous affair. Everywhere they stole glances and moments, and they were obsessed with each other. Finally, in 1938, Katharine broke off their affair, telling Almasy that Geoffrey would go mad if he ever found out. Although their affair was over, Almasy remained haunted by her, and he tried to punish her for hurting him by being particularly mean to her in public. At some point, Geoffrey somehow found out about the affair.
World War II broke out in 1939, and Almasy decided to close up their camp and arranged for Geoffrey to pick him up in the desert. Geoffrey arrived in his plane with Katharine. Geoffrey attempted to kill all three of them by crashing the plane into Almasy, who was standing on the ground. The plane missed Almasy, but the crash killed Geoffrey, left Katharine severely injured, and left them with no way to escape the desert. Almasy placed Katharine in a nearby cave, covering her with a parachute for warmth, and promised to come back for her. He walked across the desert for four days until he reached the nearest town, but when he got there, the English army would not help him get back to Katharine. Because Almasy had a foreign-sounding name, the British were suspicious and locked him up as a spy, prevented him from saving Katharine.
Almasy was eventually released, but he knew it was too late to save her. He worked for the Germans, helping their spies make their way across the desert into Cairo. After he left Cairo, his truck broke down in the desert. Without transportation, he walked to the cave to get Katharine. He took her dead body and placed it in a plane that had been buried beneath the sand. The plane malfunctioned during their flight and caught fire. Almasy parachuted down from the plane, his body covered in flames. That was the point at which the Bedouins found him and cared for his burns.
Little by little, the English patient tells this whole story. Caravaggio, who has suspected the English patient was not really English, has his suspicions confirmed. He fills in gaps for the Almasy, telling him that Geoffrey Clifton was really an agent of British Intelligence and that Intelligence had known about Almasy and Katharine's affair the whole time. They knew Almasy had started helping the Germans and planned to kill him in the desert. They lost him between Cairo and the plane crash, and now, of course, he is unrecognizable.
The focus of the novel shifts to Kip, and we are told his entire story. Although Kip's brother always distrusted the west, Kip went willingly to serve in the British army. He was trained as a bomb defuser under Lord Suffolk, a true English gentleman, and was then virtually welcomed into an English family. Kip soon grew quite skillful at his job, able to figure out both the ""joke"" and the ""character"" of each bomb he tackled. Lord Suffolk and his group were blown up defusing a bomb, and Kip decided to leave England and become a sapper in Italy.
Kip has felt emotionally removed from everyone in his job as a sapper. When he meets Hana, he uses her to once again connect to humanity. All the residents of the villa celebrate Hana's twenty-first birthday, and Kip grows comfortable as her lover. When August comes, however, Kip hears on the radio of the atomic bomb that the United States has dropped on Japan. He becomes enraged, knowing that a western country would never commit such an atrocity against another white country. He takes his gun and threatens to kill the English patient, whom he sees as a symbol of the West. Kip does not kill Almasy, but takes off on his motorcycle, leaving the villa forever. Years later, he is a doctor in India with a family of his own. Though he is happy and fulfilled in his new life, he often wonders about Hana."
Holy,"The Old Testament is a collection of thirty-nine books about the history and religion of the people of Israel. The authors of these books are unknown, and each book possesses a unique tone, style, and message. Individually, they include stories, laws, and sayings that are intended to function as models of religious and ethical conduct. Together—through hundreds of characters and detailed events—they represent a unified narrative about God and his attempt to relate to humankind by relating to a specific group of people.
The Old Testament contains four main sections: the Pentateuch, the Former Prophets (or Historical Books), the Writings, and the Latter Prophets. This study guide covers books from the first three sections.
The Pentateuch
The Pentateuch comprises the first five books of the Old Testament. It depicts a series of beginnings—the beginning of the world, of humankind, and of God’s promise to the Israelites.
Genesis, the first book, opens with God’s creation of the world. The perfect world falls into evil when humans disobey God, and the human population divides into separate nations and languages. After many generations, God speaks to a man named Abraham. God makes a promise, or covenant, with Abraham to make his descendants into a great nation and to give them a great land. Abraham shows strong faith in God, and God seals his promise with a number of signs and tests. This special covenant with God passes on to Abraham’s son, Isaac, and to his grandson, Jacob. Together, they represent the patriarchs, or fathers, of the Israelite people. Jacob’s twelve sons move to Egypt after the youngest brother, Joseph, miraculously becomes a high official in Egypt.
In the Book of Exodus, the descendants of Jacob’s children have become a vast people, but the Pharaoh of Egypt holds them in slavery. God chooses one man, Moses, to rescue the Israelites. God sends ten plagues to Egypt, and, with miraculous signs and wonders, Moses leads the people out of Egypt and across the Red Sea. They go to Mount Sinai, where God appears in a cloud of thunder over the mountain and affirms to the Israelites the promise he made to Abraham. God commands them to worship only himself, and he gives them various ethical and religious laws.
The books of Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy continue the explanation of God’s religious laws and his promises to the people. The people must keep these laws to enter and enjoy the promised land, toward which they are heading. Despite God’s presence, the Israelites complain and disobey incessantly, inciting God’s wrath. They wander the wilderness for forty years in search of the promised land. These books continue the period of Moses’s legendary leadership and miracles, until his death at the end of Deuteronomy.
The Former Prophets
The Former Prophets, or the Historical Books, cover the history of the Israelites from Moses’s death to the fall of the nation in 587 b.c. In the books of Joshua and Judges, the Israelites successfully conquer the land promised to them by God, but they disobey God by worshipping the deities of the surrounding peoples. Neighboring nations invade and oppress the Israelites. God saves the people of Israel by designating judges, or rulers, to lead the people in warding off their enemies.
The two books of Samuel (First Samuel and Second Samuel) cover the rise of the united kingdom of Israel. Israel’s religious leader, Samuel, appoints a king named Saul. Saul disobeys God, however, and God chooses another man, David, to be Israel’s king. King Saul attempts to kill the young David, but fails. Saul’s death closes the first book. In the second book, David establishes the great kingdom of Israel. He conquers Israel’s surrounding enemies and establishes Jerusalem as the religious and political center of Israel.
The books of Kings (called 1 Kings and 2 Kings) trace the decline of Israel’s success. God blesses David’s son, Solomon, with immense wisdom. As king, Solomon expands Israel into an empire and builds a great temple in Jerusalem. Solomon disobeys God by worshipping other deities, and, at his death, the kingdom splits into a northern kingdom, Israel, and a southern kingdom, Judah. A host of evil kings leads the two kingdoms away from worshipping God. Despite the attempts of the prophets Elijah and Elisha to halt Israel’s wrongdoing, the two kingdoms fall to the Assyrian and Babylonian Empires. Jerusalem is destroyed, and the people are sent into exile.
The Writings
The Writings are placed after the historical books in the Christian Bible. Some of these are narratives covering the time of Israel’s exile in other nations and its eventual return to the homeland. The Book of Esther, for example, tells the story of an unassuming Jewish girl who becomes the queen of Persia and boldly saves the Jewish people from genocide.
Many of the Writings are books of poetry and wisdom, among the most important literature in the Old Testament. The Book of Job is a lengthy dialogue investigating God’s justice and the problem of human suffering. The Psalms are lyrical poems and hymns—many attributed to King David—that express humankind’s longing for God. The books of Proverbs and Ecclesiastes—similarly attributed to the wise King Solomon—offer sayings and instructions about the meaning of life and ethical behavior. Lastly, the Song of Solomon (also attributed to Solomon) is a romantic, lyric dialogue between a young woman and her lover."
Fiber,"Guy Montag is a fireman who burns books in a futuristic American city. In Montag’s world, firemen start fires rather than putting them out. The people in this society do not read books, enjoy nature, spend time by themselves, think independently, or have meaningful conversations. Instead, they drive very fast, watch excessive amounts of television on wall-size sets, and listen to the radio on “Seashell Radio” sets attached to their ears.
Montag encounters a gentle seventeen-year-old girl named Clarisse McClellan, who opens his eyes to the emptiness of his life with her innocently penetrating questions and her unusual love of people and nature. Over the next few days, Montag experiences a series of disturbing events. First, his wife, Mildred, attempts suicide by swallowing a bottle of sleeping pills. Then, when he responds to an alarm that an old woman has a stash of hidden literature, the woman shocks him by choosing to be burned alive along with her books. A few days later, he hears that Clarisse has been killed by a speeding car. Montag’s dissatisfaction with his life increases, and he begins to search for a solution in a stash of books that he has stolen from his own fires and hidden inside an air-conditioning vent.
When Montag fails to show up for work, his fire chief, Beatty, pays a visit to his house. Beatty explains that it’s normal for a fireman to go through a phase of wondering what books have to offer, and he delivers a dizzying monologue explaining how books came to be banned in the first place. According to Beatty, special-interest groups and other “minorities” objected to books that offended them. Soon, books all began to look the same, as writers tried to avoid offending anybody. This was not enough, however, and society as a whole decided to simply burn books rather than permit conflicting opinions. Beatty tells Montag to take twenty-four hours or so to see if his stolen books contain anything worthwhile and then turn them in for incineration. Montag begins a long and frenzied night of reading.
Overwhelmed by the task of reading, Montag looks to his wife for help and support, but she prefers television to her husband’s company and cannot understand why he would want to take the terrible risk of reading books. He remembers that he once met a retired English professor named Faber sitting in a park, and he decides that this man might be able to help him understand what he reads. He visits Faber, who tells him that the value of books lies in the detailed awareness of life that they contain. Faber says that Montag needs not only books but also the leisure to read them and the freedom to act upon their ideas.
Faber agrees to help Montag with his reading, and they concoct a risky scheme to overthrow the status quo. Faber will contact a printer and begin reproducing books, and Montag will plant books in the homes of firemen to discredit the profession and to destroy the machinery of censorship. Faber gives him a two-way radio earpiece (the “green bullet”) so that he can hear what Montag hears and talk to him secretly.
Montag goes home, and soon two of his wife’s friends arrive to watch television. The women discuss their families and the war that is about to be declared in an extremely frivolous manner. Their superficiality angers him, and he takes out a book of poetry and reads “Dover Beach” by Matthew Arnold. Faber buzzes in his ear for him to be quiet, and Mildred tries to explain that the poetry reading is a standard way for firemen to demonstrate the uselessness of literature. The women are extremely disturbed by the poem and leave to file a complaint against Montag.
Montag goes to the fire station and hands over one of his books to Beatty. Beatty confuses Montag by barraging him with contradictory quotations from great books. Beatty exploits these contradictions to show that literature is morbid and dangerously complex, and that it deserves incineration. Suddenly, the alarm sounds, and they rush off to answer the call, only to find that the alarm is at Montag’s own house. Mildred gets into a cab with her suitcase, and Montag realizes that his own wife has betrayed him.
Beatty forces Montag to burn the house himself; when he is done, Beatty places him under arrest. When Beatty continues to berate Montag, Montag turns the flamethrower on his superior and proceeds to burn him to ashes. Montag knocks the other firemen unconscious and runs. The Mechanical Hound, a monstrous machine that Beatty has set to attack Montag, pounces and injects Montag’s leg with a large dose of anesthetic. Montag manages to destroy it with his flamethrower; then he walks off the numbness in his leg and escapes with some books that were hidden in his backyard. He hides these in another fireman’s house and calls in an alarm from a pay phone.
Montag goes to Faber’s house, where he learns that a new Hound has been put on his trail, along with several helicopters and a television crew. Faber tells Montag that he is leaving for St. Louis to see a retired printer who may be able to help them. Montag gives Faber some money and tells him how to remove Montag’s scent from his house so the Hound will not enter it. Montag then takes some of Faber’s old clothes and runs off toward the river. The whole city watches as the chase unfolds on TV, but Montag manages to escape in the river and change into Faber’s clothes to disguise his scent. He drifts downstream into the country and follows a set of abandoned railroad tracks until he finds a group of renegade intellectuals (“the Book People”), led by a man named Granger, who welcome him. They are a part of a nationwide network of book lovers who have memorized many great works of literature and philosophy. They hope that they may be of some help to mankind in the aftermath of the war that has just been declared. Montag’s role is to memorize the Book of Ecclesiastes. Enemy jets appear in the sky and completely obliterate the city with bombs. Montag and his new friends move on to search for survivors and rebuild civilization."
California,"Two migrant workers, George and Lennie, have been let off a bus miles away from the California farm where they are due to start work. George is a small, dark man with “sharp, strong features.” Lennie, his companion, is his opposite, a giant of a man with a “shapeless” face. Overcome with thirst, the two stop in a clearing by a pool and decide to camp for the night. As the two converse, it becomes clear that Lennie has an intellectual disability, and is deeply devoted to George and dependent upon him for protection and guidance. George finds that Lennie, who loves petting soft things but often accidentally kills them, has been carrying and stroking a dead mouse. George angrily throws it away, fearing that Lennie might catch a disease from the dead animal. George complains loudly that his life would be easier without having to care for Lennie, but the reader senses that their friendship and devotion is mutual. He and Lennie share a dream of buying their own piece of land, farming it, and, much to Lennie’s delight, keeping rabbits. George ends the night by treating Lennie to the story he often tells him about what life will be like in such an idyllic place.
The next day, the men report to the nearby ranch. George, fearing how the boss will react to Lennie, insists that he’ll do all the talking. He lies, explaining that they travel together because they are cousins and that a horse kicked Lennie in the head when he was a child. They are hired. They meet Candy, an old “swamper,” or handyman, with a missing hand and an ancient dog, and Curley, the boss’s mean-spirited son. Curley is newly married, possessive of his flirtatious wife, and full of jealous suspicion. Once George and Lennie are alone in the bunkhouse, Curley’s wife appears and flirts with them. Lennie thinks she is “purty,” but George, sensing the trouble that could come from tangling with this woman and her husband, warns Lennie to stay away from her. Soon, the ranch-hands return from the fields for lunch, and George and Lennie meet Slim, the skilled mule driver who wields great authority on the ranch. Slim comments on the rarity of friendship like that between George and Lennie. Carlson, another ranch-hand, suggests that since Slim’s dog has just given birth, they should offer a puppy to Candy and shoot Candy’s old, good-for-nothing dog.
The next day, George confides in Slim that he and Lennie are not cousins, but have been friends since childhood. He tells how Lennie has often gotten them into trouble. For instance, they were forced to flee their last job because Lennie tried to touch a woman’s dress and was accused of rape. Slim agrees to give Lennie one of his puppies, and Carlson continues to badger Candy to kill his old dog. When Slim agrees with Carlson, saying that death would be a welcome relief to the suffering animal, Candy gives in. Carlson, before leading the dog outside, promises to do the job painlessly.
Slim goes to the barn to do some work, and Curley, who is maniacally searching for his wife, heads to the barn to accost Slim. Candy overhears George and Lennie discussing their plans to buy land, and offers his life’s savings if they will let him live there too. The three make a pact to let no one else know of their plan. Slim returns to the bunkhouse, berating Curley for his suspicions. Curley, searching for an easy target for his anger, finds Lennie and picks a fight with him. Lennie crushes Curley’s hand in the altercation. Slim warns Curley that if he tries to get George and Lennie fired, he will be the laughingstock of the farm.
The next night, most of the men go to the local brothel. Lennie is left with Crooks, the lonely, Black stable-hand, and Candy. Curley’s wife flirts with them, refusing to leave until the other men come home. She notices the cuts on Lennie’s face and suspects that he, and not a piece of machinery as Curley claimed, is responsible for hurting her husband. This thought amuses her. The next day, Lennie accidentally kills his puppy in the barn. Curley’s wife enters and consoles him. She admits that life with Curley is a disappointment, and wishes that she had followed her dream of becoming a movie star. Lennie tells her that he loves petting soft things, and she offers to let him feel her hair. When he grabs too tightly, she cries out. In his attempt to silence her, he accidentally breaks her neck.
Lennie flees back to a pool of the Salinas River that George had designated as a meeting place should either of them get into trouble. As the men back at the ranch discover what has happened and gather together a lynch party, George joins Lennie. Much to Lennie’s surprise, George is not mad at him for doing “a bad thing.” George begins to tell Lennie the story of the farm they will have together. As he describes the rabbits that Lennie will tend, the sound of the approaching lynch party grows louder. George shoots his friend in the back of the head.
When the other men arrive, George lets them believe that Lennie had the gun, and George wrestled it away from him and shot him. Only Slim understands what has really happened, that George has killed his friend out of mercy. Slim consolingly leads him away, and the other men, completely puzzled, watch them leave."
Once,"In Book I, “The Sword and the Stone,” we are introduced to the Wart, a young boy who eventually becomes King Arthur. The Wart grows up in the castle of Sir Ector, his foster father. The Wart spends his days in the company of Kay, Sir Ector’s son and the heir to his title, amusing himself as best he can while Kay is instructed in the proper ways of knighthood. One night while lost in the forest, the Wart encounters the magician Merlyn, a befuddled but powerful old man who announces that he will be the Wart’s tutor. During the next six years, Merlyn tries to instill some of his wisdom in the Wart, teaching him about virtue and the world by turning the Wart into various animals. Finally, Kay is knighted, and the Wart becomes his squire, a kind of servant who assists and attends to his master as the knight travels in search of adventure. When the king of England, Uther Pendragon, dies, he leaves no heir, and it is proclaimed that the next rightful king will be whoever can pull out a mysterious sword that has been driven into a rock. The Wart and Kay travel to London, where a tournament is being held so that the finest knights will have the opportunity to try to remove the sword. While running an errand for Kay, the Wart removes the sword from the stone, and he is declared the next king of England.
Book II, “The Queen of Air and Darkness,” finds the young King Arthur, as the Wart is now called, trying to hold on to his power. Of the men rebelling against Arthur, his most notable enemy is King Lot of Orkney. As the war rages on in England, Lot’s sons, Gawaine, Gaheris, Gareth, and Agravaine, compete for the affections of their mother, the beautiful but cruel Morgause. By a twist of fate, Morgause is also Arthur’s half-sister, though he does not know it. Three knights from Arthur’s court arrive at Orkney, and unaware that their king is at war with Lot, they proceed to bumble around the countryside. Although Gawaine, Gaheris, and Gareth are all decent at heart, they and their brother, Agravaine, are happiest when they are listening to stories about their proud heritage and dreaming about wars and bloody revenge.
In England, Arthur begins to plan how he will rule when the battles are finally over. With Merlyn’s guidance, he decides to use his own power and that of his fellow knights to fight for people who cannot defend themselves. Arthur creates an order of knights to fight for good, called the Knights of the Round Table. Then, with the help of two French kings, Bors and Ban, Arthur defeats Lot’s army at the battle of Bedegraine. With her four children, Morgause travels to Arthur’s court, supposedly to reconcile Arthur with Lot. While at the court, she uses magic to seduce Arthur. Arthur is not aware that Morgause is his half-sister, but the incest is still a great sin, and by sleeping with her, Arthur ultimately brings about his own destruction.
Book III, “The Ill-Made Knight,” focuses on the great knight Lancelot and his moral conflicts. Lancelot is just a boy when King Arthur takes the throne, but he eventually becomes Arthur’s greatest knight and best friend. Trying to escape his growing feelings for Queen Guenever, Lancelot embarks on a series of quests that establish his reputation. In the last of these, he is tricked into sleeping with a young girl named Elaine. Guenever grows increasingly jealous of Elaine, and her jealousy eventually drives Lancelot insane. He roams England for several years as a wild man, unrecognized and ill-treated by everyone he meets. Finally, Elaine discovers Lancelot and nurses him back to health. Although Lancelot does not want to feel obligated to Elaine, he does, and on two occasions he leaves Camelot to spend time with her and their son, Galahad. Meanwhile, Arthur’s kingdom begins to unravel, and he tries to keep his knights occupied by sending them to find the Holy Grail. Only three knights, Sir Bors, Sir Percival, and Sir Galahad, are pure enough to find the holy vessel. Lancelot returns a humbled and deeply religious man. For a while, his love for God makes him stay away from Guenever, but after he rescues her from a kidnapper, they begin their affair again.
In Book IV, “The Candle in the Wind,” the destruction of Camelot becomes inevitable. Mordred, Arthur’s son by his incestuous union with Morgause, plots revenge against his father. Mordred and Agravaine trap Arthur into acknowledging the affair between Lancelot and Guenever, which forces Arthur to prosecute his queen and his best friend. Lancelot rescues Guenever from being burned at the stake, but in doing so, he kills two of Gawaine’s brothers, Gareth and Gaheris. Arthur and his armies lay siege to Lancelot’s castle. The pope sends an emissary to broker a truce, and Guenever returns to Arthur’s castle at Camelot. Arthur and Gawaine, however, still want to avenge the deaths of Gareth and Gaheris, and they continue to besiege Lancelot. While they are away, Mordred usurps the throne. Arthur rushes back to reclaim his kingdom. The night before his final stand against Mordred, Arthur reflects on all he has learned since his youth and wakes up confident that although this day will be his last, his legacy will live on."
Arrive,"Bri Jackson, the narrator of the novel, is a 16-year-old girl from Garden Heights, a predominantly Black inner-city neighborhood. Bri has her sights set on rap stardom, hoping to follow in the footsteps of her late father, the underground rap star Lawless. As the novel opens, Bri is nervously awaiting the phone call that could be her big break: an invitation to perform in the Ring, a local club where up-and-coming rappers face off in “battles.” But first, she must endure her ACT prep class at Midtown School of the Arts so she can get her confiscated phone back from her teacher. Bri’s two best friends from Garden Heights, Sonny and Malik, are in the class with her. Like many of the other students of color at Midtown Academy, they are bused in from less affluent neighborhoods. 
By the time Bri finally gets the call to battle at the Ring, both her teacher and her mother, Jay, have reminded her that school, not rap, is the key to her future. But Bri remains fixated on rap stardom as the solution to her family’s financial problems, especially after she learns that Jay, a recovering drug addict, has lost her job. Bri’s Aunt Pooh, a gang member and a drug dealer, escorts Bri to the battle at the Ring, where she squares off with Milez, another teen rapper. In the first round of the battle, Milez raps about Lawless’s murder, shocking Bri and causing her to freeze up when it is her turn to rap. But she soon recovers and outperforms Milez in the next two rounds, winning the battle decisively. By the following morning, a video of the battle is on YouTube and all Bri’s classmates are praising her for her skills.  
Bri’s celebration is short-lived, however. Tate and Long, two school security guards who have a reputation for targeting Black and Latinx students, single Bri out to have her bag searched. When Bri objects, they violently throw her to the ground and cuff her. Bri is suspended for having candy—which her principal refers to as ""contraband—in her backpack. The security guards are suspended too, pending an investigation, but rumors circulate around the school that Bri is a drug dealer.   
Angry about the assault and people’s racist assumptions about her, Bri writes and records a defiant song called “On the Come Up.” In the song, Bri rails against racist police and other authority figures. She also boasts about having a gun and being ready to use it—because that’s what people expect anyway—even though she barely knows anything about guns. Bri shares the recording with Supreme, her father’s old manager, who promises to make her famous. Supreme releases “On the Come Up” online, where it gets picked up by a Black gossip blog and goes viral. Many of Bri’s friends love the song, but Aunt Pooh, Malik, and Trey all chastise Bri for misrepresenting herself and rapping about gang violence that she has never taken part in.  
Real violence breaks out when Tate and Long are reinstated as the school security guards. Students of color protest outside the school while chanting some of the violent lyrics from “On the Come Up.” When Tate and Long warn them to stop, some students attack the security guards, and a riot ensues. A local news station reports that Bri’s song incited the violence. Jay sees the newscast, learns about Bri’s song for the first time, and insists that Bri stop rapping, lay low, and focus on school. Instead, Bri takes to Instagram and is interviewed by a local radio show, defiantly claiming on both platforms that she won’t be silenced. During the radio interview, Bri has to be restrained after DJ Hype insults her with sexist taunts. Bri begins to feel as though she’s becoming the violent person that others assume she is.  
Meanwhile, Bri’s family continues to struggle, falling behind on bills and rent. The electric company shuts off the power and the landlord threatens eviction. Jay quits school, setting aside her dreams so she can become eligible for food stamps. To make matters worse, the Crowns, a rival gang, rob Bri and Malik at gunpoint, taking her father’s gold chain. Aunt Pooh vows to get revenge on the Crowns and disappears for ten days. When she returns, Aunt Pooh is arrested in a drug bust and taken to jail while Bri looks on.  
With her family’s struggles in mind, Bri goes to a recording studio again, this time with Supreme. Supreme encourages Bri to embrace the persona of a “hoodlum” in her music because that is what people expect of Black rappers. He has another rapper write a song for Bri to record. Even though Bri does not agree with the lyrics, she reluctantly agrees to record the song, hoping to impress a white record executive.  
Bri returns to the Ring once more, where she is supposed to perform the song she recorded. Instead, Bri freestyles her own lyrics about refusing to be what people think she should be. The record executive angrily walks out, but the crowd goes wild. Later, an unnamed celebrity retweets the video of Bri’s freestyle and calls her the future of hip-hop. Bri decides that she will pursue a rap career, but only if she can do it on her own terms."
Night,"NOTE: Although Night is not necessarily a memoir, this SparkNotes guide often refers to it as one, since the work’s mixture of testimony, deposition, and emotional truth-telling renders it similar to works in the memoir genre. It is clear that Eliezer is meant to serve, to a great extent, as author Elie Wiesel’s stand-in and representative. Minor details have been altered, but what happens to Eliezer is what happened to Wiesel himself during the Holocaust. It is important to remember, however, that there is a difference between the persona of narrator of Night, Eliezer, and that of its author, Elie Wiesel.
Night is narrated by Eliezer, a Jewish teenager who, when the memoir begins, lives in his hometown of Sighet, in Hungarian Transylvania. Eliezer studies the Torah (the first five books of the Old Testament) and the Kabbalah (a doctrine of Jewish mysticism). His instruction is cut short, however, when his teacher, Moishe the Beadle, is deported. In a few months, Moishe returns, telling a horrifying tale: the Gestapo (the German secret police force) took charge of his train, led everyone into the woods, and systematically butchered them. Nobody believes Moishe, who is taken for a lunatic.
In the spring of 1944, the Nazis occupy Hungary. Not long afterward, a series of increasingly repressive measures are passed, and the Jews of Eliezer’s town are forced into small ghettos within Sighet. Soon they are herded onto cattle cars, and a nightmarish journey ensues. After days and nights crammed into the car, exhausted and near starvation, the passengers arrive at Birkenau, the gateway to Auschwitz.
Upon his arrival in Birkenau, Eliezer and his father are separated from his mother and sisters, whom they never see again. In the first of many “selections” that Eliezer describes in the memoir, the Jews are evaluated to determine whether they should be killed immediately or put to work. Eliezer and his father seem to pass the evaluation, but before they are brought to the prisoners’ barracks, they stumble upon the open-pit furnaces where the Nazis are burning babies by the truckload.
The Jewish arrivals are stripped, shaved, disinfected, and treated with almost unimaginable cruelty. Eventually, their captors march them from Birkenau to the main camp, Auschwitz. They eventually arrive in Buna, a work camp, where Eliezer is put to work in an electrical-fittings factory. Under slave-labor conditions, severely malnourished and decimated by the frequent “selections,” the Jews take solace in caring for each other, in religion, and in Zionism, a movement favoring the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine, considered the holy land. In the camp, the Jews are subject to beatings and repeated humiliations. A vicious foreman forces Eliezer to give him his gold tooth, which is pried out of his mouth with a rusty spoon.
The prisoners are forced to watch the hanging of fellow prisoners in the camp courtyard. On one occasion, the Gestapo even hang a small child who had been associated with some rebels within Buna. Because of the horrific conditions in the camps and the ever-present danger of death, many of the prisoners themselves begin to slide into cruelty, concerned only with personal survival. Sons begin to abandon and abuse their fathers. Eliezer himself begins to lose his humanity and his faith, both in God and in the people around him.
After months in the camp, Eliezer undergoes an operation for a foot injury. While he is in the infirmary, however, the Nazis decide to evacuate the camp because the Russians are advancing and are on the verge of liberating Buna. In the middle of a snowstorm, the prisoners begin a death march: they are forced to run for more than fifty miles to the Gleiwitz concentration camp. Many die of exposure to the harsh weather and exhaustion. At Gleiwitz, the prisoners are herded into cattle cars once again. They begin another deadly journey: one hundred Jews board the car, but only twelve remain alive when the train reaches the concentration camp Buchenwald. Throughout the ordeal, Eliezer and his father help each other to survive by means of mutual support and concern. In Buchenwald, however, Eliezer’s father dies of dysentery and physical abuse. Eliezer survives, an empty shell of a man until April 11, 1945, the day that the American army liberates the camp."
Prisoner,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban opens on the night before Harry's thirteenth birthday, when he receives gifts by Owl Post from his friends at school. The next morning at breakfast, Harry sees on television that a man named Black is on the loose from prison. At this time, Aunt Marge comes to stay with the Dursleys, and she insults Harry's parents numerous times. Harry accidentally causes her to inflate. Harry leaves the Dursley's house and is picked up by the Knight Bus, but only after an alarming sighting of a large, black dog. The Knight Bus drops Harry off at Diagon Alley, where he is greeted by Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic. He rents a room and awaits the start of school. In Diagon Alley, Harry finishes his schoolwork, admires a Firebolt broomstick in the window of a shop, and after some time, finds his friends Ron and Hermione. At a pet shop, Hermione buys a cat named Crookshanks, who chases Scabbers, Ron's aging pet rat. Ron is most displeased. The night before they all head off to Hogwarts, Harry overhears Ron's parents discussing the fact that Sirius Black is after Harry.
The students board the Hogwarts Express train and are stopped once by an entity called a Dementor. Harry faints and is revived by Professor Lupin, the new defense against the dark arts teacher. Soon afterward, the students arrive at Hogwarts and classes begin. In divination class, Professor Trelawney foresees Harry's death by reading tealeaves and finding the representation of a Grim, a large black dog symbolizing death. In the care of magical creatures class, Hagrid introduces the students to Hippogriffs, large, deeply dignified crosses between horses and eagles. Malfoy insults one of these beasts, Buckbeak, and is attacked. Malfoy drags out the injury in an attempt to have Hagrid fired and Buckbeak put to sleep. In Defense Against the Dark Arts, Professor Lupin leads the class in a defeat of a Boggart, which changes shape to appear as the viewer's greatest fear. For Lupin, it turns into an orb, for Ron, a spider. Harry doesn't have a chance to fight it.
During a Hogwarts visit to Hogsmeade, a wizard village which Harry is unable to visit because he has no permission slip, Harry has tea with Professor Lupin. Harry discovers that the reason he wasn't allowed to fight the Boggart was that Lupin had worried that it would take the shape of Voldemort. This concern catches Harry by surprise, because Harry had been thinking even more fearfully about the awful Dementors. Snape brings Lupin a steaming potion, which Lupin drinks, much to Harry's alarm. Later that night, Sirius Black breaks into Hogwarts and destroys the Fat Lady portrait that guards Gryffindor Tower. The students spend the night sleeping in the Great Hall while the teachers search the castle. Soon afterwards, Quidditch moves into full swing, and Gryffindor House plays against Hufflepuff. During the game, Harry spies the large black dog, and seconds later he sees a hoard of Dementors. He loses consciousness and falls off his broomstick. Harry wakes to find that his trusty broomstick had flown into the Whomping Willow and been smashed in his fall, and the game itself had lost. Later, Harry learns from Lupin that the Dementors affect Harry so much because Harry's past is so horrible.
During the next Hogsmeade visit, from which Harry is forbidden, Fred and George Weasley give Harry the Marauder's map, written by the mysterious quartet of Moony, Prongs, Wormtail and Padfoot. This map leads him through a secret passageway into Hogsmeade, where he rejoins Ron and Hermione. Inside the Hogsmeade tavern, Harry overhears Cornelius Fudge discussing Sirius Black's responsibility for Harry's parents' deaths, as well as for the death of another Hogwarts student, Peter Pettigrew, who was blown to bits, leaving only a finger. Back at Hogwarts, Harry learns that Hagrid received a notice saying that Buckbeak, the hippogriff who attacked Malfoy, is going to be put on trial, and Hagrid is inconsolable. The winter holidays roll around. For Christmas, Harry receives a Firebolt, the most impressive racing broomstick in the world. Much to his and Ron's dismay, Hermione reports the broomstick to Professor McGonagall, who takes it away out of fear that it may have been sent (and cursed) by Sirius Black.
After the holidays, Harry begins working with Professor Lupin to fight Dementors with the Patronus charm; he is moderately successful, but still not entirely confident in his ability to ward them off. Soon before the game against Ravenclaw, Harry's broomstick is returned to him, and as Ron takes it up to the dormitory, he discovers evidence that Scabbers has been eaten by Crookshanks. Ron is furious at Hermione. Soon afterwards, Gryffindor plays Ravenclaw in Quidditch. Harry, on his Firebolt, triumphs, winning the game. Once all the students have gone to bed, Sirius Black breaks into Harry's dormitory and slashes the curtain around Ron's bed. Several days later, Hagrid invites Harry and Ron over for tea and scolds them for shunning Hermione on account of Scabbers and the Firebolt. They feel slightly guilty, but not terrible. Soon Harry, under his invisibility cloak, meets Ron during a Hogsmeade trip; when he returns, Snape catches him and confiscates his Marauder's Map. Lupin saves Harry from Snape's rage, but afterwards he reprimands him severely for risking his safety for ""a bag of magic tricks."" As Harry leaves Lupin's office, he runs into Hermione, who informs him that Buckbeak's execution date has been set. Ron, Hermione, and Harry are reconciled in their efforts to help Hagrid. Around this time, Hermione is exceptionally stressed by all of her work, and in a day she slaps Malfoy for picking on Hagrid and she quits Divination, concluding that Professor Trelawney is a great fraud. Days later, Gryffindor beats Slytherin in a dirty game of Quidditch, winning the Cup.
Exams roll around, and during Harry's pointless Divination exam, Professor Trelawney predicts the return of Voldemort's servant before midnight. Ron, Hermione, and Harry shield themselves in Harry's invisibility cloak and head off to comfort Hagrid before the execution. While at his cabin, Hermione discovers Scabbers in Hagrid's milk jug. They leave, and Buckbeak is executed. As Ron, Harry, Harry and Hermione are leaving Hagrid's house and reeling from the sound of the axe, the large black dog approaches them, pounces on Ron, and drags him under the Whomping Willow. Harry and Hermione and Crookshanks dash down after them; oddly, Crookshanks knows the secret knob to press to still the flailing tree. They move through an underground tunnel and arrive at the Shrieking Shack. They find that the black dog has turned into Sirius Black and is in a room with Ron. Harry, Ron, and Hermione manage to disarm Black, and before Harry can kill Black, avenging his parents' deaths, Professor Lupin enters the room and disarms him. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are aghast as Lupin and Black exchange a series of nods and embrace.
Once the three students calm down enough to listen, Lupin and Black explain everything. Lupin is a werewolf who remains tame through a special steaming potion made for him by Snape. While Lupin was a student at Hogwarts, his best friends, James Potter, Sirius Black, and Peter Pettigrew, became animagi (humans able to take on animal forms) so that they could romp the grounds with Lupin at the full moon. They explain how Snape once followed Lupin toward his transformation site in a practical joke set up by Sirius, and was rescued narrowly by James Potter. At this moment, Snape reveals himself from underneath Harry's dropped invisibility cloak, but Harry, Ron, and Hermione disarm him, rendering him unconscious. Lupin and Black then explain that the real murderer of Harry's parents is not Black, but Peter Pettigrew, who has been presumed dead but really hidden all these years disguised as Scabbers. Lupin transforms Scabbers into Pettigrew, who squeals and hedges but ultimately confesses, revealing himself to be Voldemort's servant, and Black to be innocent. They all travel back to Hogwarts, but at the sight of the full moon, Lupin, who has forgotten to take his controlling tonic (the steaming liquid), turns into a werewolf. Sirius Black responds by turning into the large black dog in order to protect Harry, Ron, and Hermione from Lupin. As Black returns from driving the werewolf into the woods, a swarm of Dementors approaches, and Black is paralyzed with fear. One of the Dementors prepares to suck the soul out of Harry, whose patronus charm is simply not strong enough. Out of somewhere comes a patronus that drives the Dementors away. Harry faints.
Harry awakens in the hospital wing to hear Snape and Cornelius Fudge discussing the fact that Sirius Black is about to be given the fatal Dementor's Kiss. Harry and Hermione protest, claiming Black's innocence, but to no avail; then Dumbledore enters the room, shoos out the others, and mysteriously suggests that Harry and Hermione travel back through Hermione's time-turning device, and save both Black and Buckbeak. Hermione turns her hour-glass necklace back three turns, and Harry and Hermione are thrust into the past, where they rescue Buckbeak shortly before his execution. From a hiding place in the forest, Harry watches the Dementor sequence and discovers that he had been the one who conjured the patronus, and he is touched and confused to note that his patronus had taken the shape of a stag that he recognizes instantly as Prongs, his father's animagi form. After saving his past self from the Dementors, Harry and Hermione fly to the tower where Black is imprisoned, and they rescue Black, sending him away to freedom on Buckbeak's back. The next day, Harry is saddened to learn that Professor Lupin is leaving Hogwarts because of the previous night's scare. Dumbledore meets with Harry and gives him wise fatherly advice on the events that have happened. On the train ride home, Harry receives an owl- post letter from Sirius that contains a Hogsmeade permission letter, words of confirmation that he is safe in hiding with Buckbeak and that he was, in fact, the sender of the Firebolt, and a small pet owl for Ron. Harry feels slightly uplifted as he returns to spend his summer with the Dursleys."
Finally,"When the novel opens, Lily Bloom sits on the roof of a building in Boston, looking out at the city and the stars, thinking about death. She’s just come from her father’s funeral. She’s reflecting on how much she resents her father for abusing her mother when a man joins her on the roof and starts angrily kicking a patio chair. The man, Ryle Kincaid, is a neurosurgeon, and the two begin to flirt and tell each other increasingly intimate “naked truths.” Ryle reveals that he lost a child patient because the child’s brother shot him accidentally. Lily tells Ryle that she gave the eulogy at her abusive father’s funeral and couldn’t think of anything nice to say, so she stood there for two minutes in purposeful silence. Lily also tells Ryle she lost her virginity to a homeless boy named Atlas. Ryle tells Lily he wants to sleep with her, but he only has one-night stands and never wants to get married or have children. Though Lily is interested in Ryle, she can’t imagine having sex without it leading to a relationship. 
Six months later, Lily uses her inheritance to buy a storefront to convert into a flower shop. A woman named Allysa offers to work for Lily, and the two become fast friends. Lily and Allysa are cleaning up the storefront when Lily falls and hurts her ankle. Allysa calls her husband Marshall and her brother for help. When Allysa’s brother arrives, Lily sees that it’s Ryle. They pretend not to know each other for Allysa’s sake, but Ryle tells Lily that he still wants to sleep with her. They decide they need to stay away from each other because they want different things. As Lily recovers from her sprained ankle for a week, she reads her teenage journals, which were written as letters addressed to Ellen DeGeneres. They tell the story of Atlas and Lily. 
As a teenager, Lily notices a boy is living in an abandoned house behind hers. She feels for Atlas and begins to leave him food, lend him her father’s clothes, and let him shower at her house. The two become closer and begin to fall in love, and Atlas becomes a confidant and protector for Lily when her father hurts her and her mother. The two watch Ellen and Finding Nemo together and tell each other to “just keep swimming” when times get tough, quoting a line from the movie. Atlas learns a family member can take him in in Boston, and though Lily dreads it, Atlas moves away to find more stability. She’s heartbroken, but he returns on her 16th birthday. He gives her a magnet that says that everything is better in Boston. They make love for the first time. Atlas promises to come for Lily when he feels that his life is good enough for her. Then Lily’s father walks in on them. He savagely beats Atlas with a baseball bat. Atlas is taken away in an ambulance. This is the last time Lily sees Atlas, and throughout her life, she wonders why Atlas never came back for her.
Back in the present, Ryle pursues Lily, and after trying to get her to have sex with him, he admits he has feelings for her. Lily insists they not have sex and try dating, since she doesn’t trust him to have a relationship with her. They quickly start falling for each other. After they have been dating for a bit, Ryle invites himself to dinner with Lily and her mom. At dinner, Lily sees Atlas working at the restaurant. She’s shocked. During a brief conversation, Atlas tells Lily he has a girlfriend but that he wishes they had run into each other a year ago. Lily doesn’t tell Ryle that she ran into Atlas and tries to avoid going back to the restaurant again. One night, when Ryle and Lily are hanging out, Ryle burns himself on a casserole dish he tries to take out of the oven without a mitt. When Lily laughs, Ryle pushes her, and she hits her head. She’s bleeding, and she feels horrified and heartbroken, immediately worrying she’s turned into her mother. He’s quickly apologetic and eventually she forgives him, saying that if anything violent happens again, she’ll leave him.
They go to dinner with Allysa and Marshall at the same restaurant where Atlas works to celebrate that Allysa and Marshall are going to have a baby. Atlas comes to the table and the waiter introduces him as the chef. Atlas notices that both Lily and Ryle are injured and intuits that Ryle hurt her. When they are alone, Atlas tells Lily to leave Ryle. When she refuses, he says she’s like her mother. Ryle sees them together, and he learns that the chef is Atlas, the boy from Lily’s past. It comes to blows and Atlas throws Ryle out of his restaurant. Lily assures Ryle that nothing is going on between her and Atlas. They enjoy a period of peace and decide to get married in Vegas. But Ryle’s jealousy continues to simmer. When Ryle discovers that Atlas has given Lily his phone number, he flies into a jealous rage and pushes Lily down the stairs. She’s badly injured. When Allysa finds out what happened, she insists Ryle tell Lily about his past. He confesses that, just like the young patient he lost the night they met, his brother died of a gunshot wound because Ryle accidentally shot him. He marks this as the origin of his rage. Lily forgives him, and they try to be together again.
Allysa and Marshall have a baby and name her after Ryle. The night Rylee is born, Lily comes home to find Ryle in a strange mood. He makes her read an article in the newspaper in which Atlas mentions a woman who is special to him and says that the name of his restaurant (Bib’s) means “Better in Boston.” Ryle has the magnet in his hand and has read all of Lily’s teenage journals. He attempts to rape Lily and headbutts her so hard she blacks out. She calls Atlas to come get her, and he takes her to the hospital, where she discovers she’s pregnant. She takes her time figuring out what she wants for her life, confused by her emotions for Atlas and by all her conflicting feelings of rage and love and hurt for Ryle. She gradually lets Ryle back into her life in a platonic way, telling him about the baby, though she’s unsure what she wants from him. 
When the baby is born, Lily and Ryle name her Emerson, after Ryle’s brother. Lily says she wants a divorce because she would never want her daughter to endure what she and her mother did. Ryle agrees, though he is heartbroken about it. They share custody of Emerson. One day, Lily runs into Atlas. He says his life is good enough for Lily now, so if she’s ever ready to fall in love again, he’s there for her. She says she’s ready, and they embrace. He says she can stop swimming."
Markers,"In 1951, an African American woman named Henrietta Lacks discovered what she called a “knot” on her cervix that turned out to be a particularly virulent form of cervical cancer. The head of gynecology at Johns Hopkins Hospital, who was studying cervical cancer at the time, had asked the head of tissue culture, George Gey, to develop a culture of both healthy and cancerous surgical cell tissue. As a result, Gey asked for tissue samples from all cervical cancer patients, including Henrietta Lacks. At the time, no human cells had ever survived long in a laboratory, but Henrietta’s cancer cells, which Gey labeled as HeLa, survived. Meanwhile, Henrietta underwent treatment for her cervical cancer but succumbed to the disease, leaving behind her five children and husband. The Lacks family had no idea that doctors had taken her cells or that some of her cells were still alive. When the doctors at Hopkins requested an autopsy, Henrietta’s husband Day hesitated, but relented at his cousin’s insistence when a doctor suggested that the information gleaned from the autopsy could someday help his children. It wasn’t until 1973, when a family friend who was a researcher mentioned that he did work on HeLa cells, that the family learned a part of Henrietta was still alive.
Gey’s culture of HeLa cells not only survived, but allowed scientists to conduct unprecedented research on disease and genetics, as well as develop new medical treatments and vaccines. At no charge, Gey gave samples of HeLa cells to any researcher who requested them. Over time, for-profit cell culture labs sprung up, mass-producing HeLa cells and other cell lines in order to more efficiently supply research labs. However, because HeLa cells were so hearty and grew so quickly, they had the potential to contaminate other cell cultures. In 1973, geneticists realized that if they could identify distinct genetic markers within HeLa cells, they could more easily identify which cultures had been contaminated. To that end, a geneticist at Hopkins asked Henrietta’s children to have blood samples taken. The doctors didn’t make sure that the Lacks children understood why they needed to have blood drawn, and Deborah, Henrietta’s daughter, believed that they were giving her a cancer screening.
 Meanwhile, because HeLa cells and cell culturing promised so many advances in medicine, the media spread the story of the “immortal” cell culture and the mysterious woman behind the cells. Although a colleague of Gey’s published Henrietta’s real name in a small niche journal, most mainstream news outlets mistakenly gave her name as Helen Lane. In 1975, a journalist from Rolling Stone named Michael Rogers discovered Henrietta’s true name and contacted the Lacks family for an article about HeLa cells. The Lacks family was horrified to learn that other people were profiting from Henrietta’s cells. The experience reminded them of the terrible history of white doctors in the US conducting unethical research on black patients. Journalists continued to approach the family, including a BBC documentary team in 1996. Deborah hoped the documentary would bring Henrietta’s story to light and help Deborah learn more about her mother. Unfortunately, the documentary also attracted Sir Lord Cofield, a conman, to the family. Posing as a lawyer, Cofield claimed he could help the family sue Hopkins Hospital. When the family discovered his scam, he threatened legal action against the family, terrifying them. The stress from the ordeal gave Deborah a stroke.
		
In 1999, Rebecca Skloot, the author of this book, attempted to make contact with the Lacks family as she began her research. Because of the history of white journalists contacting the family for stories without offering transparency or proper compensation, in addition to the very recent ordeal with Cofield, the family initially didn’t want to speak with her. However, Skloot kept trying to make contact and spoke with several cousins in the Lacks family. Because she knew that Deborah wanted to know more about who her mother was as a person, Skloot left messages on Deborah’s phone sharing what she learned about Henrietta’s childhood. Finally, Sonny and Deborah Lacks agreed to speak with her. Deborah made Skloot promise to share all of her research and help her understand what happened to her mother. She also wanted to find out what happened to her sister, Elsie, who had been placed in a mental institution before Deborah was born. Skloot agreed, and Deborah regularly accompanied Skloot on her research trips.
In 2001, a researcher at Johns Hopkins invited the Lacks family to his lab. Accompanied by Skloot, Deborah and Deborah’s brother, Zakariyya, finally got to see where Hopkins kept their mother’s cells, and even watched HeLa cells divide under a microscope in real time. Later that week, Skloot and Deborah went to the hospital where Elsie had been institutionalized, and discovered that she’d been subjected to horrific abuse. Deborah’s blood pressure spiked from the stress of everything she had learned that weekend, and she began to behave erratically. Her cousin, Gary, performed a religious soul cleansing ceremony on her in which he lifted the burden of the cells from Deborah’s shoulders. To Skloot’s surprise, Gary proclaimed that from now on Skloot would help carry the burden for Deborah. Deborah decided that she wanted to learn more about science in order to better understand what happened to her mother, but didn’t have the money to pursue adult education. Instead, she focused her efforts on her grandchildren and her siblings’ grandchildren, and encouraged them to go to school. Skloot remained in contact with Deborah as she wrote the book and promised to share the final manuscript before it went to press. Sadly, Deborah died in 2009, right as Skloot made final touches on the book before publication."
Old,"The Old Man and the Sea is the story of an epic struggle between an old, seasoned fisherman and the greatest catch of his life. For eighty-four days, Santiago, an aged Cuban fisherman, has set out to sea and returned empty-handed. So conspicuously unlucky is he that the parents of his young, devoted apprentice and friend, Manolin, have forced the boy to leave the old man in order to fish in a more prosperous boat. Nevertheless, the boy continues to care for the old man upon his return each night. He helps the old man tote his gear to his ramshackle hut, secures food for him, and discusses the latest developments in American baseball, especially the trials of the old man’s hero, Joe DiMaggio. Santiago is confident that his unproductive streak will soon come to an end, and he resolves to sail out farther than usual the following day.
On the eighty-fifth day of his unlucky streak, Santiago does as promised, sailing his skiff far beyond the island’s shallow coastal waters and venturing into the Gulf Stream. He prepares his lines and drops them. At noon, a big fish, which he knows is a marlin, takes the bait that Santiago has placed one hundred fathoms deep in the waters. The old man expertly hooks the fish, but he cannot pull it in. Instead, the fish begins to pull the boat.
Unable to tie the line fast to the boat for fear the fish would snap a taut line, the old man bears the strain of the line with his shoulders, back, and hands, ready to give slack should the marlin make a run. The fish pulls the boat all through the day, through the night, through another day, and through another night. It swims steadily northwest until at last it tires and swims east with the current. The entire time, Santiago endures constant pain from the fishing line. Whenever the fish lunges, leaps, or makes a dash for freedom, the cord cuts Santiago badly. Although wounded and weary, the old man feels a deep empathy and admiration for the marlin, his brother in suffering, strength, and resolve.
On the third day the fish tires, and Santiago, sleep-deprived, aching, and nearly delirious, manages to pull the marlin in close enough to kill it with a harpoon thrust. Dead beside the skiff, the marlin is the largest Santiago has ever seen. He lashes it to his boat, raises the small mast, and sets sail for home. While Santiago is excited by the price that the marlin will bring at market, he is more concerned that the people who will eat the fish are unworthy of its greatness.
As Santiago sails on with the fish, the marlin’s blood leaves a trail in the water and attracts sharks. The first to attack is a great mako shark, which Santiago manages to slay with the harpoon. In the struggle, the old man loses the harpoon and lengths of valuable rope, which leaves him vulnerable to other shark attacks. The old man fights off the successive vicious predators as best he can, stabbing at them with a crude spear he makes by lashing a knife to an oar, and even clubbing them with the boat’s tiller. Although he kills several sharks, more and more appear, and by the time night falls, Santiago’s continued fight against the scavengers is useless. They devour the marlin’s precious meat, leaving only skeleton, head, and tail. Santiago chastises himself for going “out too far,” and for sacrificing his great and worthy opponent. He arrives home before daybreak, stumbles back to his shack, and sleeps very deeply.
The next morning, a crowd of amazed fishermen gathers around the skeletal carcass of the fish, which is still lashed to the boat. Knowing nothing of the old man’s struggle, tourists at a nearby café observe the remains of the giant marlin and mistake it for a shark. Manolin, who has been worried sick over the old man’s absence, is moved to tears when he finds Santiago safe in his bed. The boy fetches the old man some coffee and the daily papers with the baseball scores, and watches him sleep. When the old man wakes, the two agree to fish as partners once more. The old man returns to sleep and dreams his usual dream of lions at play on the beaches of Africa."
Regretted,"Nora Seed, a 36-year-old music store clerk, is struggling to cope with overwhelming regret about the state of her life. In a period of just over a day, Nora’s cat dies, she loses her job at the music store, she has a confrontational run-in with her former bandmate, and she loses her lone piano student. Her brother Joe is avoiding her, her best friend Izzy isn’t responding to her text messages, and even her next-door neighbor, old Mr. Banerjee, says he doesn’t need Nora to help him with his medications anymore. Her parents have passed away, her father when she was a teenager, and her mother just a few years ago. After her mother’s death, Nora left her ex-fiancé, Dan, just two days before they were supposed to be married. Nora surveys her life and sees only pain, grief, and regret. She decides that she has nothing left to live for. She leaves a note, makes a final post on social media, and attempts to kill herself.
When Nora awakes from her attempt, she finds herself in front of a strange building. When she enters, all she can see in every direction is books. She encounters Mrs. Elm, her beloved high-school librarian who comforted her when Nora’s father passed away. Mrs. Elm explains that Nora is in a place in between life and death called the Midnight Library. She tells Nora that time doesn’t move here, and when Nora examines her watch, she sees that it is frozen at midnight. Mrs. Elm introduces Nora to The Book of Regrets, which articulates everything Nora has regretted in her life. The other books contain infinite variations of Nora’s life. Any book she chooses will allow her to see how her life would have turned out if she had made different choices. As soon as Nora feels disappointed in a life she visits, she will return to the Midnight Library. Nora still wants to die and is uninterested in the library, but Mrs. Elm encourages her to pick a book anyway. The first life Nora visits is the one in which she married Dan, and they own a pub together in the English countryside.
In her life with Dan, Nora is impressed to see that they have accomplished Dan’s dream of owning a pub in the English countryside. She quickly learns, however, that Dan cheated on her, and in the course of their interactions, Nora remembers how difficult her relationship with Dan often was. She wonders if they’ve outgrown each other, and she returns to the Midnight Library, where she is still filled with despair. Mrs. Elm coaches her to think of another life she might want to visit, and Nora chooses one in which she has kept her cat Volts inside, hoping he would live longer. In that life, she immediately finds that Volts is dead beneath her bed. She returns to the Midnight Library angry with Mrs. Elm. Mrs. Elm explains that Volts would have died in any life because he had a heart condition. Nora learns that she was a good cat owner to Volts, and her regret about not taking good enough care of him disappears from The Book of Regrets.
Nora continues to visit many iterations of her life. She sees that if she had gone to Australia with her best friend then Izzy would have died in a car wreck on the way to Nora’s birthday party. If she became an Olympic swimmer as her father had wanted, her father would have lived much longer, but her mother would have died much sooner. In that life, Nora has all the trappings of power and is poised to give a talk about success to a room full of thousands of people. But she recognizes that this successful life is lonely, and in many ways, she’s still suffering there. 
Next, Nora sees the life she would have had if she had become a glaciologist, a dream she had when she was very young. There, she has a near-death encounter with a polar bear, and facing death makes her realize that she truly wants to live. She also encounters another person who is sliding between lives, Hugo, who shares his observations about the nature of reality. She leaves that life to experience what it would be like if her band with her brother, The Labyrinths, had made it big. She’s a wildly successful rock star with millions of Instagram followers. She briefly enjoys the trappings of fame before learning that she’s embroiled in a complicated series of scandals and tragedies. When she learns that Joe died of a drug overdose two years prior, she is transported back to the Midnight Library.
Nora slides into alternate lives many times, and she begins to enjoy the process of learning more and more about herself and the world. However, after a while, she begins to lose herself and feels as though she wants to find a life that she can settle into. She slides into a beautiful life, with her loving husband Ash and daughter Molly, work she enjoys, and a nice home. It’s a life filled with love and ease, and she reminds herself again and again that it is a good life. As she visits the neighborhood from her root life, Nora sees the positive impacts her small actions have had on others. Nora realizes that no matter how good her life with Ash and Molly is, she didn’t earn it. Though she badly wants to stay and feels deep love for her family, Nora can’t stop herself from sliding back to the library.
Distraught, Nora begs Mrs. Elm to return her to the good life, but the Midnight Library is falling apart. The books are all catching on fire. Nora’s watch starts keeping time again, and Mrs. Elm says it’s possible that Nora is dying in her root life. But Nora deeply wants to live. She races to the book of her root life and writes “I AM ALIVE” on one of its blank pages. With that, the Midnight Library disappears, and Nora finds herself on the brink of death in her root life. She seeks out help from her neighbor and ends up in the hospital. Nora reconciles with her brother, who begs her not to leave him again, and with Izzy, who wants to catch up. Nora is filled with gratitude. She visits Mrs. Elm, and they play a game of chess, reflecting that one never knows how the game, or life, will end."
Floridas,"In the midst of a raging war, a plane evacuating a group of schoolboys from Britain is shot down over a deserted tropical island. Two of the boys, Ralph and Piggy, discover a conch shell on the beach, and Piggy realizes it could be used as a horn to summon the other boys. Once assembled, the boys set about electing a leader and devising a way to be rescued. They choose Ralph as their leader, and Ralph appoints another boy, Jack, to be in charge of the boys who will hunt food for the entire group.
Ralph, Jack, and another boy, Simon, set off on an expedition to explore the island. When they return, Ralph declares that they must light a signal fire to attract the attention of passing ships. The boys succeed in igniting some dead wood by focusing sunlight through the lenses of Piggy’s eyeglasses. However, the boys pay more attention to playing than to monitoring the fire, and the flames quickly engulf the forest. A large swath of dead wood burns out of control, and one of the youngest boys in the group disappears, presumably having burned to death.
At first, the boys enjoy their life without grown-ups and spend much of their time splashing in the water and playing games. Ralph, however, complains that they should be maintaining the signal fire and building huts for shelter. The hunters fail in their attempt to catch a wild pig, but their leader, Jack, becomes increasingly preoccupied with the act of hunting.
When a ship passes by on the horizon one day, Ralph and Piggy notice, to their horror, that the signal fire—which had been the hunters’ responsibility to maintain—has burned out. Furious, Ralph accosts Jack, but the hunter has just returned with his first kill, and all the hunters seem gripped with a strange frenzy, reenacting the chase in a kind of wild dance. Piggy criticizes Jack, who hits Piggy across the face. Ralph blows the conch shell and reprimands the boys in a speech intended to restore order. At the meeting, it quickly becomes clear that some of the boys have started to become afraid. The littlest boys, known as “littluns,” have been troubled by nightmares from the beginning, and more and more boys now believe that there is some sort of beast or monster lurking on the island. The older boys try to convince the others at the meeting to think rationally, asking where such a monster could possibly hide during the daytime. One of the littluns suggests that it hides in the sea—a proposition that terrifies the entire group.
Not long after the meeting, some military planes engage in a battle high above the island. The boys, asleep below, do not notice the flashing lights and explosions in the clouds. A parachutist drifts to earth on the signal-fire mountain, dead. Sam and Eric, the twins responsible for watching the fire at night, are asleep and do not see the parachutist land. When the twins wake up, they see the enormous silhouette of his parachute and hear the strange flapping noises it makes. Thinking the island beast is at hand, they rush back to the camp in terror and report that the beast has attacked them.
The boys organize a hunting expedition to search for the monster. Jack and Ralph, who are increasingly at odds, travel up the mountain. They see the silhouette of the parachute from a distance and think that it looks like a huge, deformed ape. The group holds a meeting at which Jack and Ralph tell the others of the sighting. Jack says that Ralph is a coward and that he should be removed from office, but the other boys refuse to vote Ralph out of power. Jack angrily runs away down the beach, calling all the hunters to join him. Ralph rallies the remaining boys to build a new signal fire, this time on the beach rather than on the mountain. They obey, but before they have finished the task, most of them have slipped away to join Jack.
Jack declares himself the leader of the new tribe of hunters and organizes a hunt and a violent, ritual slaughter of a sow to solemnize the occasion. The hunters then decapitate the sow and place its head on a sharpened stake in the jungle as an offering to the beast. Later, encountering the bloody, fly-covered head, Simon has a terrible vision, during which it seems to him that the head is speaking. The voice, which he imagines as belonging to the Lord of the Flies, says that Simon will never escape him, for he exists within all men. Simon faints. When he wakes up, he goes to the mountain, where he sees the dead parachutist. Understanding then that the beast does not exist externally but rather within each individual boy, Simon travels to the beach to tell the others what he has seen. But the others are in the midst of a chaotic revelry—even Ralph and Piggy have joined Jack’s feast—and when they see Simon’s shadowy figure emerge from the jungle, they fall upon him and kill him with their bare hands and teeth.
The following morning, Ralph and Piggy discuss what they have done. Jack’s hunters attack them and their few followers and steal Piggy’s glasses in the process. Ralph’s group travels to Jack’s stronghold in an attempt to make Jack see reason, but Jack orders Sam and Eric tied up and fights with Ralph. In the ensuing battle, one boy, Roger, rolls a boulder down the mountain, killing Piggy and shattering the conch shell. Ralph barely manages to escape a torrent of spears.
Ralph hides for the rest of the night and the following day, while the others hunt him like an animal. Jack has the other boys ignite the forest in order to smoke Ralph out of his hiding place. Ralph stays in the forest, where he discovers and destroys the sow’s head, but eventually, he is forced out onto the beach, where he knows the other boys will soon arrive to kill him. Ralph collapses in exhaustion, but when he looks up, he sees a British naval officer standing over him. The officer’s ship noticed the fire raging in the jungle. The other boys reach the beach and stop in their tracks at the sight of the officer. Amazed at the spectacle of this group of bloodthirsty, savage children, the officer asks Ralph to explain. Ralph is overwhelmed by the knowledge that he is safe but, thinking about what has happened on the island, he begins to weep. The other boys begin to sob as well. The officer turns his back so that the boys may regain their composure."
Annexed,"Anne’s diary begins on her thirteenth birthday, June 12, 1942, and ends shortly after her fifteenth. At the start of her diary, Anne describes fairly typical girlhood experiences, writing about her friendships with other girls, her crushes on boys, and her academic performance at school. Because anti-Semitic laws forced Jews into separate schools, Anne and her older sister, Margot, attended the Jewish Lyceum in Amsterdam.
	The Franks had moved to the Netherlands in the years leading up to World War II to escape persecution in Germany. After the Germans invaded the Netherlands in 1940, the Franks were forced into hiding. With another family, the van Daans, and an acquaintance, Mr. Dussel, they moved into a small secret annex above Otto Frank’s office where they had stockpiled food and supplies. The employees from Otto’s firm helped hide the Franks and kept them supplied with food, medicine, and information about the outside world.
	The residents of the annex pay close attention to every development of the war by listening to the radio. Some bits of news catch Anne’s attention and make their way into her diary, providing a vivid historical context for her personal thoughts. The adults make optimistic bets about when the war will end, and their mood is severely affected by Allied setbacks or German advances. Amsterdam is devastated by the war during the two years the Franks are in hiding. All of the city’s residents suffer, since food becomes scarce and robberies more frequent.
	Anne often writes about her feelings of isolation and loneliness. She has a tumultuous relationship with the adults in the annex, particularly her mother, whom she considers lacking in love and affection. She adores her father, but she is frequently scolded and criticized by Mr. and Mrs. van Daan and Mr. Dussel. Anne thinks that her sister, Margot, is smart, pretty, and agreeable, but she does not feel close to her and does not write much about her. Anne eventually develops a close friendship with Peter van Daan, the teenage boy in the annex. Mr. Frank does not approve, however, and the intensity of Anne’s infatuation begins to lessen.
	Anne matures considerably throughout the course of her diary entries, moving from detailed accounts of basic activities to deeper, more profound thoughts about humanity and her own personal nature. She finds it difficult to understand why the Jews are being singled out and persecuted. Anne also confronts her own identity. Though she considers herself to be German, her German citizenship has been revoked, and though she calls Holland her home, many of the Dutch have turned against the Jews. Anne feels a tremendous solidarity with her aggrieved people, and yet at the same time she wants to be seen as an individual rather than a member of a persecuted group.
During the two years recorded in her diary, Anne deals with confinement and deprivation, as well as the complicated and difficult issues of growing up in the brutal circumstances of the Holocaust. Her diary describes a struggle to define herself within this climate of oppression. Anne’s diary ends without comment on August 1, 1944, the end of a seemingly normal day that leaves us with the expectation of seeing another entry on the next page. However, the Frank family is betrayed to the Nazis and arrested on August 4, 1944. Anne’s diary, the observations of an imaginative, friendly, sometimes petty, and rather normal teenage girl, comes to an abrupt and silent end. 
Otto Frank is the family’s sole survivor, and he recovers Anne’s diary from Miep. He decides to fulfill Anne’s wishes by publishing the diary. Anne’s diary becomes a condemnation of the unimaginable horror of the Holocaust, and one of the few accounts that describe it from a young person’s perspective.
	Since Anne’s diary is a true personal account of a life in hiding, it is inappropriate to analyze it as a novel or other work of fiction. Parts of the diary were intended for public view, but others clearly were not. To appreciate and interpret the diary, it is necessary to consider its horrible context, World War II and the Holocaust, before any discussion of plot development or thematic content."
Individuals,"Ordinary People is set in Lake Forest, Illinois, during the 1970s. The action focuses on the Jarrett family--Calvin and Beth and their son Conrad. Before the action of the book begins, there was a second Jarrett son--Buck--who was killed in a boating accident over a year before the novel begins. After the death of Buck, Conrad became deeply troubled, blaming himself. He tried to commit suicide by slashing his wrists; his attempt failed when Calvin found him, before he died, in the bathtub. After the attempt, Conrad was hospitalized. He went through therapy and befriended Karen, a girl his age who had also tried to kill herself.
The action of the book begins a month after Conrad is released from the hospital. While he is physically cured, he is by no means emotionally cured, and at the request of his father, he begins to see a psychiatrist, Dr. Berger. He tells Berger that he doesn't think highly of psychiatry, but he wants Berger to help him gain more control over others so that he can make his father stop worrying about him. Conrad goes back to school, where he has experienced a severe academic downturn ever since Buck's death. He is a junior, and he is a member of the swimming team. However, he feels he is becoming alienated from even some of his best friends, such as Joe Lazenby, and ends up becoming more and more isolated. He decides to quit the swimming team, although he does not tell his parents about the decision until a month later. He spends his time instead in the library after school. He even goes out for a Coke with his old friend Karen at one point, and he sees that she is doing much better. As the year progresses, he becomes interested in a girl at school named Jeannine Pratt, who is new to Lake Forest. They go out a couple of times before they start to date seriously towards the end of the year. Meanwhile, Conrad continues to see Berger, although it is unclear whether he is making much progress. The novel focuses on his family life, and we see that Conrad is becoming increasingly alienated from his mother, who is not interested in pampering him or dwelling on the past. His relationship with his father is somewhat strained as well.
During the winter, Conrad goes to see a swim meet on a whim, and afterwards he gets into a fist fight with an old friend who has begun to treat him cruelly. In some ways, it is unclear whether Conrad is really getting better. His father grows increasingly concerned about him. That spring, he goes to stay with his grandparents while his parents go on vacation to Houston. There, he spends lots of time with Jeannine. One night, however, he reads in the newspaper that his friend Karen has committed suicide. He is suddenly thrown into shock, and he spends the whole night in a dream-like trance thinking about his time with Karen, his own suicide attempt, and the death of his brother. He goes out walking at 2 am to think some more, and he is stopped by a police officer and told to return home. He falls back into a dream at home and then wakes up at dawn. He immediately calls Berger and requests to meet with him. In Berger's office, Conrad has a breakdown and admits that he blames himself for the death of Buck. Berger tells him to stop blaming himself and to stop trying to fill Buck's shoes; Conrad needs to allow himself to feel more even when he feels bad, and he needs to be himself for a change. After this breakdown and release of emotion, Conrad begins to heal substantially, enjoying a great relationship with Jeannine. At the end of the novel, he has moved to Evanston with his family, and in the Epilogue we see him rebuilding his old friendship with Lazenby.
The story of Conrad is told opposite the story of his father, Calvin, who spends most of his time in the novel worrying about Conrad. Calvin is a tax attorney who runs a small firm with his partner, Ray Hanley. Most of the chapters devoted to Calvin depict him by himself, thinking about the past and his son and wife. It is clear from the beginning that Calvin and Beth have serious communication problems. Essentially, Calvin wants to talk through the past with his family; he believes that talking is the way to heal. Beth, however, abhors Calvin's philosophy: she only wants to move on and leave the past behind. She also constantly criticizes her husband for pampering Conrad. She thinks Conrad ought to be left to grow up on his own without parents breathing down his neck all the time. Indeed, Beth thinks that she managed to heal her own hurts on her own, and she does not understand why everyone else can't do the same. Calvin and Beth attend parties together and spend lots of time with their own friends, and we see them in numerous situations. As the novel progresses, however, the communication rift between Beth and Calvin only widens. They fight more and more about how to treat Conrad. They also fight about vacations. Beth feels that the family must get away from Illinois for Christmas, but Calvin makes them stay in Lake Forest in hopes that they can talk through their problems as a family. In the spring, they take a golfing trip to Houston together; however, things blow up when Beth again rails on Calvin for his obsession with Conrad. When they return to Illinois, they hardly speak to one another until Beth announces to Calvin that she is leaving for Europe. While they do not talk about divorce, their differences seem irrevocable by the end of the novel. After Beth leaves, however, Conrad and Calvin really come together for the first time in the novel, saying that they love each other and showing an interest in developing a better relationship. Calvin and Conrad move to Evanston."
Completion,"Never Let Me Go takes place in a dystopian version of late 1990s England, where the lives of ordinary citizens are prolonged through a state-sanctioned program of human cloning. The clones, referred to as students, grow up in special institutions away from the outside world. As young adults, they begin to donate their vital organs. All “donors” receive care from designated “carers,” clones who have not yet begun the donation process. The clones continue to donate organs until they “complete,” which is a euphemism for death after the donation of three or four organs. However, this premise is not immediately apparent to the reader. At the start of the novel, narrator Kathy H. merely introduces herself as a thirty-one-year-old carer. She has been a carer for nearly twelve years, but will leave her role in a few months. Kathy explains that she wants to revisit her memories of Tommy and Ruth, two friends who grew up with her at the Hailsham school. Kathy does not explain the donation program, or mention that Hailsham students are clones.
Although Kathy’s narration is often nonlinear, the novel’s three parts roughly align with three stages in her life. In Part One, Kathy remembers her childhood at Hailsham. She describes her friendship with Ruth, whose temperamental personality contrasts with her own quiet demeanor. At Hailsham, Ruth often annoys Kathy by pretending to have special knowledge and privileges. Kathy also describes Tommy, a student known for throwing violent temper tantrums. Tommy is initially an outcast among his peers because he lacks artistic ability, which the Hailsham staff (part teacher, part parent figures known as “guardians”), and its students value highly. Kathy sympathizes with Tommy, and tries to calm him down during one of his tantrums. Tommy later learns to control his temper after a guardian named Miss Lucy assures him that it is not necessary for him to be creative.
Although the students learn vaguely about the donation program, their guardians shield them from a full understanding of their future. Miss Lucy disagrees with this indirect approach, and often exhibits strange behavior in front of the students as a result, in one instance telling them explicitly about their futures. After Miss Lucy speaks with Tommy about his artwork, he and Kathy theorize that creativity may be connected to donations. They speculate about Madame, a woman who visits Hailsham to collect the best student artwork. Madame is rumored to keep this art in a personal gallery. Kathy later encounters Madame in the girls’ dormitory, while Kathy dances to the song “Never Let Me Go.” The song is Kathy’s favorite track on Songs After Dark, a Judy Bridgewater album that is one of her most prized possessions. When the song ends, Kathy sees Madame crying in the doorway. Shortly afterwards, Kathy loses her tape. Tommy’s temper returns during their last summer at Hailsham. Kathy thinks he is upset about his recent breakup with Ruth, whom he has dated for six months. But Tommy is upset about Miss Lucy, who recently told him that she was wrong to dismiss the importance of creativity. Miss Lucy departs Hailsham abruptly, and Tommy mends his relationship with Ruth.
In Part Two, Kathy moves with Ruth and Tommy to a transitional housing facility known as the Cottages. They adjust to their new lives, becoming acquainted with the “veteran” students living there already. Ruth often ignores Tommy and Kathy in her efforts to blend in with the veterans, who are not from Hailsham. Kathy notices that the veterans regard the Hailsham students with awe. One couple, Chrissie and Rodney, are especially interested in Hailsham. They convince Ruth to go with them to Norfolk, where Rodney claims to have seen Ruth’s “possible” in an open-plan office (a “possible” is a human that resembles a specific clone and from whom that clone's DNA may have been copied). Kathy is skeptical of Rodney’s story, especially since it features Ruth’s “dream future” of working in an open-plan office. In the end, Kathy, Tommy, Ruth, Rodney, and Chrissie all drive to Norfolk.
In Norfolk, Chrissie and Rodney ask about a rumored exception allowing Hailsham couples in love to defer their donations. Ruth pretends to know something about deferrals, which surprises Kathy and Tommy. The students eventually find the open-plan office. Rodney points to a woman in the window, and they all agree that she could be Ruth’s legitimate possible. They follow her to an art gallery, where they realize that the woman does not actually resemble Ruth. In her disappointment, Ruth says that the students are modeled only on “trash.” Ruth goes off with Chrissie and Rodney. Meanwhile, Tommy and Kathy find a copy of Kathy’s lost tape in a secondhand store. Tommy tells Kathy that he has begun drawing pictures of imaginary animals. He thinks Madame uses the students’ artwork to determine if couples applying for deferrals are truly in love. After Norfolk, Ruth stops talking about her dream future. Tommy shows his drawings to Kathy, who finds them puzzling but captivating. Meanwhile, Kathy’s friendship with Ruth grows increasingly tense. Ruth reveals that she knows Kathy likes Tommy, but says that Tommy will never return Kathy’s feelings. Shortly afterwards, Kathy submits her application for carer training and departs.
Part Three focuses on Kathy’s time as carer. While Kathy is good at her job, the work is both difficult and lonely. She unexpectedly runs into a Hailsham friend named Laura, who is also a carer. They talk about Ruth, who had a bad first donation. They also talk about Hailsham, which has closed. Kathy becomes Ruth’s carer, but their relationship is strained and guarded. One day, Ruth expresses a desire to visit a beached fishing boat near Tommy’s recovery center. They pick up Tommy on the way to the boat, which they find bleached and crumbling in a marsh. The marsh reminds both Tommy and Ruth of Hailsham. They also discuss Chrissie, who completed on her second donation. On the return trip, Ruth apologizes for keeping Tommy and Kathy apart. She encourages them to pursue a deferral, revealing that she has discovered Madame’s home address. In the weeks that follow, Kathy and Ruth reminisce peacefully about Hailsham and the Cottages. Ruth also encourages Kathy to become Tommy’s carer.
Ruth completes after her second donation. Tommy gives his third donation, and Kathy becomes his carer. They spend their days reading and talking at his recovery center. Eventually, they also begin to have sex. Hoping to pursue a deferral, they go to visit Madame at the address Ruth provided. Madame invites them inside and listens to their request, after which Miss Emily appears from the next room. Miss Emily says that deferrals do not exist. She explains that Hailsham was part of a progressive movement committed to raising clones more humanely. Madame used to exhibit the students’ artwork to show the outside world that clones had souls. Although the movement once had many supporters, changing public opinion eventually forced Hailsham to close. On the drive back to his recovery center, Tommy asks Kathy to pull over. He walks into the woods and begins screaming. Kathy goes to Tommy and holds him. Soon after, Tommy gives his fourth donation and completes. Kathy drives to a field in Norfolk, where she allows herself to imagine Tommy on the horizon. Then she drives away."
Human,"Lawyer Bryan Stevenson gives a first-person account of his decades helping marginalized Americans who have been unfairly and harshly punished by the U.S. criminal justice system, which disproportionately targets people of color and poor people. At the heart of Just Mercy is the story of Walter McMillian, a Black man who was framed for the murder of a girl named Ronda Morrison, convicted, and sent to death row. 
Stevenson alternates chapters about Walter with his personal reflections on our country’s history with racial disparity and issues around incarceration. Stevenson highlights other groups of vulnerable people who have been victimized by the criminal justice system and shares the stories of the prisoners he has helped over the years. The book also follows the growth of Stevenson’s nonprofit law project, the Alabama-based Equal Justice Initiative (EJI), through its expansion from focusing on death row prisoners to helping people sentenced to life without parole. Stevenson chronicles how EJI becomes a significant force in criminal justice reform.
In 1983 as a law student, Stevenson discovers his life’s passion when he interns with the Georgia-based Southern Prisoners Defense Committee and meets his first death row prisoner. After graduation Stevenson accepts a job with the organization to represent poor prisoners, including those in Alabama who lack any public defender. He meets Walter McMillian on Alabama’s death row. Walter owns a successful business but also transgresses racial boundaries when he has an affair with a white woman. Soon after the affair becomes public, the woman’s friend, Ralph Myers, accuses Walter of committing the unsolved murder of Ronda Morrison, which has outraged the community. Law enforcement, including a racist sheriff and the district attorney, eagerly pounces on this accusation, overlooking Walter’s alibi and a lack of evidence. Instead, they actively force Ralph to stick with his story even when he tries to recant. They coerce other false witness testimonies, and—as revealed years later—actively suppress evidence.
After Stevenson and the team at EJI unsuccessfully appeal Walter’s conviction, they launch their own investigation of the crime and uncover new evidence. They find witnesses who can prove the witnesses against Walter lied as well as financial records that indicate that one of these witnesses was paid to give false testimony. Stevenson and his team also petition for and receive all records from Walter’s trial. However, their big break comes when they receive a phone call from Ralph, who now wants to make amends. Ralph admits to lying about Walter and says he was threatened by law enforcement. Stevenson wins a hearing for Walter where he can present his new evidence: Ralph’s testimony, which is confirmed by health care workers and other inmates, as well as recordings of the law enforcement team threatening Ralph if he doesn’t frame Walter. 
While the judge refuses to grant Walter relief, Stevenson continues the appeal process through the Alabama courts. The district attorney asks outside agents to investigate the murder for which Walter was convicted, and the investigators determine that Walter had nothing to do with the crime. Six weeks later, the court invalidates Walter’s conviction. Stevenson and the State file a joint motion to dismiss the charges, and Walter is set free.
Throughout the process, Stevenson and Walter become close friends, and Stevenson helps Walter upon his release, including filing a civil suit on his behalf and offering him a place to stay. Walter works with Stevenson to share his story, giving interviews and speaking at legal conferences, and Walter is even featured in a documentary. Unfortunately, Walter is diagnosed with advancing dementia and is forced to rely on family and eventually a nursing facility for his care. He dies in 2013. Stevenson gives a eulogy at his funeral and shares all he learned from Walter, particularly that we must extend mercy to everyone, even those who have not earned it.
Interspersed with chapters chronicling Walter’s narrative are stories of Stevenson’s other clients and work. His closeness with these prisoners and their horrifying circumstances makes Stevenson more determined to help and causes him to reflect on abstract issues that nevertheless imbue the criminal justice system, like humanity and mercy. Stevenson focuses on several categories of vulnerable people who become trapped in the system, including mentally ill prisoners, disabled prisoners, and poor women who give birth to stillborn babies. 
Stevenson and his team at EJI also become increasingly focused on juvenile offenders who are sometimes tried as adults despite their young age. These offenders may be given de facto death sentences by being sentenced to life without parole and face perilous circumstances when they are housed in adult prisons. Stevenson illustrates how these prisoners retain their own humanity while being forced to live under inhumane conditions. He also discusses some of the qualities common among these types of prisoners: They are generally poor and disproportionately people of color, and most of them lack adequate legal counsel. The juveniles have horrific backgrounds of abuse and neglect.
Stevenson and his team at EJI also work to change the legal system to offer more protection to marginalized people. Several of his cases end up before the U.S. Supreme Court, and he succeeds in winning rulings that ban as unconstitutional the conviction of children to life without parole and the execution of people deemed incompetent from dementia or neurological disease. EJI works to raise public awareness of issues surrounding unfair incarceration, produces groundbreaking reports on racial issues, and sets up programs to help formerly incarcerated people adjust to life on the outside.
Stevenson also reflects on the issues that surround the criminal justice system. His time spent with prisoners awaiting their execution makes him realize how inhumane it is to prepare another human to die. After decades of work, when Stevenson fails to prevent the execution of a man who suffers from an intellectual disability, he momentarily feels unable to continue his work. However, he realizes that he cannot help but be broken by his experiences and comes to understand that it is his own brokenness that allows him to more fully understand the need for mercy and to bring compassion to others. The book ends with Stevenson’s renewed commitment to helping others."
Good,"Nick Carraway, a young man from Minnesota, moves to New York in the summer of 1922 to learn about the bond business. He rents a house in the West Egg district of Long Island, a wealthy but unfashionable area populated by the new rich, a group who have made their fortunes too recently to have established social connections and who are prone to garish displays of wealth. Nick’s next-door neighbor in West Egg is a mysterious man named Jay Gatsby, who lives in a gigantic Gothic mansion and throws extravagant parties every Saturday night.
Nick is unlike the other inhabitants of West Egg—he was educated at Yale and has social connections in East Egg, a fashionable area of Long Island home to the established upper class. Nick drives out to East Egg one evening for dinner with his cousin, Daisy Buchanan, and her husband, Tom, an erstwhile classmate of Nick’s at Yale. Daisy and Tom introduce Nick to Jordan Baker, a beautiful, cynical young woman with whom Nick begins a romantic relationship. Nick also learns a bit about Daisy and Tom’s marriage: Jordan tells him that Tom has a lover, Myrtle Wilson, who lives in the valley of ashes, a gray industrial dumping ground between West Egg and New York City. Not long after this revelation, Nick travels to New York City with Tom and Myrtle. At a vulgar, gaudy party in the apartment that Tom keeps for the affair, Myrtle begins to taunt Tom about Daisy, and Tom responds by breaking her nose.
As the summer progresses, Nick eventually garners an invitation to one of Gatsby’s legendary parties. He encounters Jordan Baker at the party, and they meet Gatsby himself, a surprisingly young man who affects an English accent, has a remarkable smile, and calls everyone “old sport.” Gatsby asks to speak to Jordan alone, and, through Jordan, Nick later learns more about his mysterious neighbor. Gatsby tells Jordan that he knew Daisy in Louisville in 1917 and is deeply in love with her. He spends many nights staring at the green light at the end of her dock, across the bay from his mansion. Gatsby’s extravagant lifestyle and wild parties are simply an attempt to impress Daisy. Gatsby now wants Nick to arrange a reunion between himself and Daisy, but he is afraid that Daisy will refuse to see him if she knows that he still loves her. Nick invites Daisy to have tea at his house, without telling her that Gatsby will also be there. After an initially awkward reunion, Gatsby and Daisy reestablish their connection. Their love rekindled, they begin an affair.
After a short time, Tom grows increasingly suspicious of his wife’s relationship with Gatsby. At a luncheon at the Buchanans’ house, Gatsby stares at Daisy with such undisguised passion that Tom realizes Gatsby is in love with her. Though Tom is himself involved in an extramarital affair, he is deeply outraged by the thought that his wife could be unfaithful to him. He forces the group to drive into New York City, where he confronts Gatsby in a suite at the Plaza Hotel. Tom asserts that he and Daisy have a history that Gatsby could never understand, and he announces to his wife that Gatsby is a criminal—his fortune comes from bootlegging alcohol and other illegal activities. Daisy realizes that her allegiance is to Tom, and Tom contemptuously sends her back to East Egg with Gatsby, attempting to prove that Gatsby cannot hurt him.
When Nick, Jordan, and Tom drive through the valley of ashes, however, they discover that Gatsby’s car has struck and killed Myrtle, Tom’s lover. They rush back to Long Island, where Nick learns from Gatsby that Daisy was driving the car when it struck Myrtle, but that Gatsby intends to take the blame. The next day, Tom tells Myrtle’s husband, George, that Gatsby was the driver of the car. George, who has leapt to the conclusion that the driver of the car that killed Myrtle must have been her lover, finds Gatsby in the pool at his mansion and shoots him dead. He then fatally shoots himself.
Nick stages a small funeral for Gatsby, ends his relationship with Jordan, and moves back to the Midwest to escape the disgust he feels for the people surrounding Gatsby’s life and for the emptiness and moral decay of life among the wealthy on the East Coast. Nick reflects that just as Gatsby’s dream of Daisy was corrupted by money and dishonesty, the American dream of happiness and individualism has disintegrated into the mere pursuit of wealth. Though Gatsby’s power to transform his dreams into reality is what makes him “great,” Nick reflects that the era of dreaming—both Gatsby’s dream and the American dream—is over."
Rigorous,"In Outliers: The Story of Success, Malcolm Gladwell considers the circumstances that lead to success. The first half of the book looks closely at how opportunities matter more in the lives of successful people than hard work or raw talent. The second half of the book focuses on cultural legacies: behavioral tendencies rooted in their ancestral past.
Part One examines the role of opportunity in the lives of extremely successful people. Gladwell’s first example is the Canadian Hockey League, the world’s most competitive youth hockey league. Since the cutoff date for the Canadian leagues that serve the youngest players is January 1, those born in the first part of the calendar year are much larger and more coordinated than their peers. The larger and more coordinated kids are given more playing time and better coaching, and thus become better players by the time they reach the top league. An overwhelming majority of Canadian professional hockey players have birthdays in January, February or March.
Gladwell proposes that 10,000 hours of practice is needed to master a skill, even for prodigies like Mozart. Bill Joy, Bill Gates, and the Beatles all worked hard to achieve success but benefited from opportunities they did not create. Joy, one of the founders of Sun Microsystems, happened to attend one of the first colleges in the world with a time-sharing terminal. In graduate school, he had a terminal in his room, where he spent all of his free time programming. Gates happened to attend a private high school with a time-sharing terminal connected to a mainframe in Seattle. He also was able to spend all of his free time programming. Early on, the Beatles were hired to play long shows day after day in Hamburg, Germany. 
Birth year or era is another form of opportunity. Gates and Joy (as well as other early programmers) all reached the end of their teen years just as personal computers became available to the public. In another example, fourteen of the top seventy-five richest people in the history of the world happened to be alive at the same time, in the same country: the United States in the mid-1800s.
Opportunity matters more than an individual’s IQ. Using a study conducted by Lewis Terman, the creator of the Stanford-Binet IQ test, Gladwell shows that “practical intelligence” is as important as “analytical intelligence.” He also contrasts Chris Langan, one of the world’s smartest living people, with Robert Oppenheimer. While both had difficulties in college, only Oppenheimer had a successful life, due to his practical intelligence.
The last portion of Part One looks at Joe Flom, a successful lawyer from New York City. While he was born into a poor family to Jewish immigrants (in a time when Jewish immigrants were not treated well), many of the disadvantages in his life were actually benefits and directly contributed to his success.
Part Two investigates cultural legacies. Using flight recorder transcripts from several plane crashes from the last few decades, Gladwell shows that cultural expectations and habits can be a severe hindrance to pilots. Copilots from countries that have a high “Power Distance Index” (those that show the most deference to authority) will often avoid telling pilots that they are making mistakes, even when the mistakes are potentially fatal. After recognizing the dangers of such cultural expectations, commercial aviation has instituted programs to change the way flight crews talk with one another. 
Gladwell next analyzes the disparity in public school math test scores between Eastern and Western countries. He suggests that the cultures in which rice paddy farming is historically important have a stronger work ethic. Using various examples, Gladwell shows that hard work has a greater impact on success in learning mathematics than intelligence. 
The final example is an examination of the KIPP school in the South Bronx and the “achievement gap” between socioeconomic groups. American students from middle-class and affluent households retain more information over summer vacation and are more likely to make additional gains than students from low-income households. The KIPP school uses longer school days and summer programming to eliminate the achievement gap for low-income children. While the work schedule is very rigorous, the school’s students go on to great academic success.
Gladwell demonstrates that if more opportunities were available, there would be far more successful people and the world would be richer for it."
Dread,"The Princess Bride begins with William Goldman's discussion of his life, his family, the book itself (written, he assures us, by S. Morgenstern), and its relation to his own childhood and adulthood. He proclaims that it is his favorite book and that he has edited out the ""good parts,"" the action stories that his father read to him when he was ten and in bed with pneumonia.
The story proper begins with Buttercup, one of the world's twenty most beautiful women, and her tomboyish life on a farm with her parents, her horse, and Westley, their farm-boy. One afternoon a band of Florinese royalty appear on the farm, and while Buttercup watches a well-dressed Countess watch Westley, she falls suddenly, madly, jealously in love with this man she has known all her life. She professes her love to him, and he leaves immediately to America to seek his fortune, and soon is reported to have been murdered by the Dread Pirate Roberts. Buttercup is broken, and vows never to love again.
The next three chapters are short and deal primarily with the wedding preparations of Prince Humperdinck. We learn that he loves to hunt, is quite good at it, and spends the majority of time in his Zoo of Death (the original ""Pit of Despair"") hunting the vile and dangerous animals he has collected there. His father, King Lotharon, is old and dying, and Prince Humperdinck must marry to take his place as Florin's king. After an unfortunate occurrence with the princess of Guilder, he is led to Buttercup by his confidante, Count Rugen, and he demands her hand in marriage.
In Chapter Five, Buttercup is kidnapped by a criminal band consisting of Vizzini, Fezzik, and Inigo. Followed closely by a mysterious black boat, they sail with her to the cliffs on the coast of Guilder. On the coast, each of the men is defeated in his strength by their pursuer, the man in black, and while Inigo and Fezzik, after a sword-fight and wrestling match, respectively, are left unconscious but alive, Vizzini is killed in a battle of wits. The man in black runs with Buttercup along the Guilder terrain, and soon is revealed to be the long-lost Westley. The lovers reunite and, in an attempt to avoid capture by Prince Humperdinck and his men, Buttercup and Westley travel through the Fireswamp, an eerie and dangerous place. We find out here that Westley is the pirate that everybody had assumed had killed Westley. Upon exiting the swamp, they encounter Humperdinck anyway, and Buttercup agrees to return with the prince to Florin as long as he promises to return Westley safely to his ship. The lovers are separated again.
Chapter Six follows each of the main characters in their plans leading up to the wedding between Buttercup and Humperdinck. Inigo and Fezzik reunite in the Florin Thieves Quarters and set out to find the man in black. The man in black (Westley) is currently being tortured in the Zoo of Death by Humperdinck and Count Rugen. Buttercup is having nightmares and pining away for Westley, who in turn is still pining away for her. Humperdinck is planning to murder Buttercup on their wedding night in order to frame Guilder and begin a war. Everybody is harried and busy as the wedding approaches. Humperdinck reassures Buttercup that he has sent out his four fastest ships to find Westley, Buttercup realizes that he is lying and calls him a weakling, and Humperdinck us terribly offended by this and rages off to the Zoo of Death to kill Westley on the torture machine. Inigo and Fezzik hear Westley's scream and follow it to the Zoo of Death.
Chapter Seven plots Inigo and Fezzik inside the false entrance to the Zoo of Death, where they must pass many ghastly creatures before descending to the fifth level and finding Westley. The highlights of this underground journey are a ravenous snake and King bats, and Fezzik and Inigo respectively save each other's life. On the bottom level, they finally find Westley's corpse, and they drag him to Miracle Max's house in hope of reviving him. Miracle Max and his wife Valerie are feisty and difficult and reluctant to help, but they are very experienced in miracles, so once they set out to revive Westley, they create a successful miracle pill which does the trick. Inigo and Fezzik administer it to Westley on the top of the castle wall, and Westley comes back to life instantly and concocts a plan for them to enter the castle proper. This plan involves Fezzik being lit on fire and wheeled toward the guards, and it works without a hitch.
Chapter Eight follows the final acts of the main characters, first tracing Inigo as he challenges, chases, is wounded by and ultimately kills Count Rugen. Buttercup is married to Humperdinck, left in his chamber where she plans to kill herself when she sees Westley, alive on the prince's bed. Westley frightens Humperdinck with talk about how he would leave him alive but maimed if they were to duel, and the prince allows himself to be tied to a chair by Buttercup. Meanwhile, Fezzik, who has gotten lost on the grounds, appears with the prince's four white horses, and he, Inigo, Westley and Buttercup ride away. S. Morganstern ends the book with a series of ominous crises, but William Goldman cuts in and says that he believes that they do escape and live happily, though not perfectly, ever after."
Furtherance,"In the late nineteenth century, a man named Samuel Hamilton settles in the Salinas Valley in northern California. He brings his strict but loving wife, Liza, with him from Ireland. Although Samuel is well respected in the community, he never becomes a wealthy man. The Hamiltons go on to have nine children and become a prominent family in the valley.
Adam Trask, meanwhile, settles in the valley with his pregnant wife Cathy where he eventually becomes friends with Samuel Hamilton. Before moving to California, Adam lives on a farm in Connecticut with his half-brother, Charles. The dark and moody Charles resents the fact that his and Adam’s father, Cyrus, has always favored the good-natured Adam. Upon his death, Cyrus leaves his sons a large and unexpected fortune, probably stolen during his days as an administrator in the U.S. Army. Despite their newfound wealth, Adam and Charles remain unable to get along. Charles is disgusted at his brother’s marriage to Cathy, who, unbeknownst to Adam or Charles, is a former prostitute who murdered her parents and stole their money. Although Charles despises Cathy, he takes her into his bed after she drugs Adam on their wedding night.
Adam and Cathy move to California, as Adam proves unable to live peacefully with Charles in Connecticut. In Salinas, Cathy learns she is pregnant and attempts to abort her baby in order to prevent any furtherance of ties to her husband. She is desperate to escape Adam despite the fact that he loves her and provides for her. The abortion is unsuccessful, and Cathy eventually gives birth to twins, Aron and Caleb (Cal). It is clear from the start, however, that Cathy does not care about the infants and wants to leave the household as soon as possible. One day, Cathy shoots Adam, flees the house, and moves to Salinas proper to resume her life as a prostitute. Adam decides to cover for Cathy by lying to the local sheriff and saying that his gunshot wound was an accident.
Cathy wins the trust of Faye, the madam of a local brothel, then poisons her and fools the doctors and other prostitutes into thinking that Faye died naturally. Cathy assumes control of the brothel and starts to blackmail powerful men in Salinas with photographs of them performing sadomasochistic sex acts with her and her prostitutes. To protect the dazed Adam and his twin boys, neither Samuel Hamilton nor Lee, Adam’s housekeeper, tells Adam or the boys that Cathy works at a brothel.
As the twins grow older, Aron manifests his father’s good heart, whereas Cal exhibits his mother’s ruthlessness and tendency to manipulate. By the time they reach early adolescence, however, Cal actively struggles against his dark side and prays to God to make him more like Aron. Adam, meanwhile, remains melancholy and listless for years after Cathy’s departure. In order to jolt Adam out of his despondency, Samuel finally tells him the truth about Cathy. Samuel dies soon afterward.
After Samuel’s funeral, Adam visits Cathy at the brothel. Her deteriorating body and cynical, vulgar talk make Adam realize that he can now move on and forget her, as she is a repugnant creature who has become irrelevant to his life. Cathy, however, is desperate to retain power over Adam. She even offers to have sex with him to keep him in the brothel and prove that he is no better than she. Adam refuses and leaves with a serene smile.
After his triumph over Cathy, Adam becomes a livelier and more committed father to his boys. Adam decides to move the family off the ranch and into the town of Salinas so that Aron and Cal can attend school. The twins are assigned to the seventh grade, and Aron begins a relationship with Abra, the goodhearted daughter of a corrupt county supervisor. Cal continues to struggle with his dark side, and when he finally happens to discover the truth about his mother, he believes that her evil has been passed down to him. But Adam’s housekeeper, Lee, who has extensively researched the biblical story of Cain and Abel, advises Cal that God intends each individual to choose his own moral destiny rather than be constrained by the legacy of his parents. This idea, encapsulated by the Hebrew word timshel (meaning “thou mayest”), counters Cal’s fatalistic idea that he has inherited his mother’s evil and sin.
Aron gradually withdraws into religious fervor in order to shield himself from the corruption of the world—an approach that Abra and Lee consider cowardly. Adam, meanwhile, squanders the family fortune on a poorly executed business venture involving refrigerated shipping of vegetables. Aron graduates from high school early and leaves for Stanford University. Adam misses Aron terribly, thinking him smarter and more ambitious than Cal.
However, Cal, in collaboration with Will Hamilton, one of Samuel’s sons, works secretly to earn back the fortune his father lost on the failed refrigeration business. Cal also hopes to make enough money to pay for Aron’s tuition at Stanford. In the strained economy of World War I, Will and Cal buy beans from local farmers at an unfairly low price and sell the beans, in turn, to desperate British buyers at an unfairly high price. The venture nets Cal thousands of dollars, which he plans to give to his father as a gift at Thanksgiving.
Aron, who is miserable at Stanford, comes home for Thanksgiving. Adam is thrilled to see Aron but appalled by Cal’s gift of money. Adam considers the money to be earned dishonestly and tells Cal to give it back to the farmers from whom he stole it. Enraged and jealous of Adam’s obvious preference for Aron, Cal loses control of his anger and rashly tells Aron the truth about their mother, Cathy. When Cal takes Aron to the brothel to show him that Cathy is still alive, the revelation crushes the fragile Aron, who screams incoherently and runs away. The next day, the shattered Aron joins the Army, while Cathy, horrified by her son’s reaction to her, commits suicide by overdosing on morphine. She leaves her entire fortune—part of it inherited from Charles, part of it earned through blackmail and prostitution—to Aron.
When Adam discovers that Aron has joined the Army, he lapses into a state of shock. Lee talks to Cal about the idea of timshel and urges Cal to remember that, despite his guilt, he is a normal, flawed human being—not an aberrant embodiment of evil. This discussion makes Cal feel somewhat better, and he is able to begin a relationship with Abra, who is no longer in love with Aron.
A telegram arrives informing the family that Aron has been killed in World War I. Adam has a severe stroke upon hearing the news, and Lee brings Abra and Cal to see Adam on his deathbed. Lee informs Adam that the guilt-stricken Cal told Aron about their mother only because Cal was convinced that their father loved Aron more than him. Lee asks Adam to offer his blessing to Cal before he dies. At this, Adam raises his hand and whispers the single word timshel."
Provide,"Starr Carter, a sixteen-year-old black girl, attends a party in her neighborhood, Garden Heights. Starr goes with Kenya, a friend with whom she shares an older half-brother, Seven. Ever since attending Williamson Prep, a primarily white school, Starr feels out of place in the Garden Heights social scene. When Kenya goes off with other friends, Starr runs into her childhood best friend, Khalil Harris, whom she hasn’t seen in a long time. Gunshots from a gang fight interrupt the party, and Khalil offers to take Starr home. While Khalil drives, he explains rapper Tupac Shakur’s idea that “Thug Life” stands for “The Hate U Give Little Infants F---- Everybody.” Soon after, a white police officer with the badge number one-fifteen pulls them over. Khalil questions the motivation for the stop, and One-Fifteen orders him out of the car and searches him. One-Fifteen commands Khalil not to move, and returns to his car. Khalil opens the door to check on Starr. One-Fifteen fatally shoots Khalil.
Starr has nightmares about the death of another childhood friend, Natasha, who died in the crossfire of a gang shooting. At school on Monday, Starr feels tense around Hailey and Chris, her white friend and boyfriend, as memories of Khalil’s death interrupt her thoughts and she realizes they don’t understand. At the urging of her uncle Carlos, a police officer, Starr goes into the police station after school with her mother, Lisa, to testify about Khalil’s shooting. Starr realizes that the officers are asking more questions about whether Khalil was a troublemaker than about the night of the shooting. She worries that justice for Khalil will not be served. At Khalil’s funeral, a lawyer and activist named April Ofrah confirms Starr’s fears when she announces that the police will not pursue legal action against One-Fifteen and invites the attendees to a rally in Khalil’s honor. Starr blames herself for the police’s inaction. King, the head of a local gang called the King Lords, also interrupts the funeral and places a gray bandana on Khalil’s casket, signifying Khalil’s membership in the King Lords. April Ofrah tells Starr to call her if she needs legal representation.
The news that the police won’t prosecute One-Fifteen leads to days of protests in Garden Heights. During this time, Maverick, Starr’s father, explains to her his interpretation of Tupac’s phrase “Thug Life.” He believes that Thug Life describes a system designed against black communities. Only by speaking out can black communities begin to break the cycle. At the Carter family’s grocery store, a teenage member of the King Lords named DeVante begs Maverick, a former King Lord, to help him leave the gang. Maverick agrees. Starr sees DeVante’s request as a chance to help someone in a similar situation as Khalil. A few days later, Maverick gets into an argument with the neighborhood barber, Mr. Lewis. Although the argument is peaceful, two police officers intervene, and when they see Maverick is Starr’s father, they push him to the ground and search him. Between this scary event and pressure from Kenya, Starr decides that she will no longer be silent.
The District Attorney calls Lisa to announce that a grand jury will hear the case against One-Fifteen and asks if Starr will testify. Starr agrees, and April Ofrah decides to represent Starr pro bono, and also find a way to get Starr a television interview. Meanwhile, DeVante tells Starr that Khalil had never been a member of the King Lords and only sold drugs for King to protect his mother, who had stolen money from King. During Starr’s television interview, she decides, against Ms. Ofrah’s advice, to talk about the truth behind Khalil’s drug dealing. Starr’s implication of King enrages him. The night before her grand jury testimony, someone throws a brick and fires a gun into the Carter household. Unsure if the culprits are the King Lords or the police, Starr almost backs out of testifying. However, she ultimately decides that Khalil needs her truth. She testifies before the grand jury.
Almost two months later, the grand jury announces their decision not to indict One-Fifteen. Starr and some of her friends get caught up in the resulting riots. As she tries to avoid the chaos, Starr stumbles upon a protest led by Ms. Ofrah. She offers Starr the megaphone, and Starr leads a chant in front of the protest. The police try to break up the protest with tear gas. Starr and her friends head to the Carter family store to get milk to help heal their eyes. A Molotov cocktail lands in the store, setting it ablaze and trapping them. Maverick arrives just in time to unlock the back door. King arrives to taunt them, proud about getting his revenge. The police arrive, and King, confident that no one will testify against him, claims ignorance. However, the neighbors rally around the Carter family and tell the police that they saw King throw the Molotov cocktail. The police arrest King. Although the grocery store is in ruins, Starr knows that the family will rebuild. She vows to continue fighting for justice on behalf of Khalil and all other black people killed at the hands of police."
Statute,"Lawyer Bryan Stevenson gives a first-person account of his decades helping marginalized Americans who have been unfairly and harshly punished by the U.S. criminal justice system, which disproportionately targets people of color and poor people. At the heart of Just Mercy is the story of Walter McMillian, a Black man who was framed for the murder of a girl named Ronda Morrison, convicted, and sent to death row. 
Stevenson alternates chapters about Walter with his personal reflections on our country’s history with racial disparity and issues around incarceration. Stevenson highlights other groups of vulnerable people who have been victimized by the criminal justice system and shares the stories of the prisoners he has helped over the years. The book also follows the growth of Stevenson’s nonprofit law project, the Alabama-based Equal Justice Initiative (EJI), through its expansion from focusing on death row prisoners to helping people sentenced to life without parole. Stevenson chronicles how EJI becomes a significant force in criminal justice reform.
In 1983 as a law student, Stevenson discovers his life’s passion when he interns with the Georgia-based Southern Prisoners Defense Committee and meets his first death row prisoner. After graduation Stevenson accepts a job with the organization to represent poor prisoners, including those in Alabama who lack any public defender. He meets Walter McMillian on Alabama’s death row. Walter owns a successful business but also transgresses racial boundaries when he has an affair with a white woman. Soon after the affair becomes public, the woman’s friend, Ralph Myers, accuses Walter of committing the unsolved murder of Ronda Morrison, which has outraged the community. Law enforcement, including a racist sheriff and the district attorney, eagerly pounces on this accusation, overlooking Walter’s alibi and a lack of evidence. Instead, they actively force Ralph to stick with his story even when he tries to recant. They coerce other false witness testimonies, and—as revealed years later—actively suppress evidence.
After Stevenson and the team at EJI unsuccessfully appeal Walter’s conviction, they launch their own investigation of the crime and uncover new evidence. They find witnesses who can prove the witnesses against Walter lied as well as financial records that indicate that one of these witnesses was paid to give false testimony. Stevenson and his team also petition for and receive all records from Walter’s trial. However, their big break comes when they receive a phone call from Ralph, who now wants to make amends. Ralph admits to lying about Walter and says he was threatened by law enforcement. Stevenson wins a hearing for Walter where he can present his new evidence: Ralph’s testimony, which is confirmed by health care workers and other inmates, as well as recordings of the law enforcement team threatening Ralph if he doesn’t frame Walter. 
While the judge refuses to grant Walter relief, Stevenson continues the appeal process through the Alabama courts. The district attorney asks outside agents to investigate the murder for which Walter was convicted, and the investigators determine that Walter had nothing to do with the crime. Six weeks later, the court invalidates Walter’s conviction. Stevenson and the State file a joint motion to dismiss the charges, and Walter is set free.
Throughout the process, Stevenson and Walter become close friends, and Stevenson helps Walter upon his release, including filing a civil suit on his behalf and offering him a place to stay. Walter works with Stevenson to share his story, giving interviews and speaking at legal conferences, and Walter is even featured in a documentary. Unfortunately, Walter is diagnosed with advancing dementia and is forced to rely on family and eventually a nursing facility for his care. He dies in 2013. Stevenson gives a eulogy at his funeral and shares all he learned from Walter, particularly that we must extend mercy to everyone, even those who have not earned it.
Interspersed with chapters chronicling Walter’s narrative are stories of Stevenson’s other clients and work. His closeness with these prisoners and their horrifying circumstances makes Stevenson more determined to help and causes him to reflect on abstract issues that nevertheless imbue the criminal justice system, like humanity and mercy. Stevenson focuses on several categories of vulnerable people who become trapped in the system, including mentally ill prisoners, disabled prisoners, and poor women who give birth to stillborn babies. 
Stevenson and his team at EJI also become increasingly focused on juvenile offenders who are sometimes tried as adults despite their young age. These offenders may be given de facto death sentences by being sentenced to life without parole and face perilous circumstances when they are housed in adult prisons. Stevenson illustrates how these prisoners retain their own humanity while being forced to live under inhumane conditions. He also discusses some of the qualities common among these types of prisoners: They are generally poor and disproportionately people of color, and most of them lack adequate legal counsel. The juveniles have horrific backgrounds of abuse and neglect.
Stevenson and his team at EJI also work to change the legal system to offer more protection to marginalized people. Several of his cases end up before the U.S. Supreme Court, and he succeeds in winning rulings that ban as unconstitutional the conviction of children to life without parole and the execution of people deemed incompetent from dementia or neurological disease. EJI works to raise public awareness of issues surrounding unfair incarceration, produces groundbreaking reports on racial issues, and sets up programs to help formerly incarcerated people adjust to life on the outside.
Stevenson also reflects on the issues that surround the criminal justice system. His time spent with prisoners awaiting their execution makes him realize how inhumane it is to prepare another human to die. After decades of work, when Stevenson fails to prevent the execution of a man who suffers from an intellectual disability, he momentarily feels unable to continue his work. However, he realizes that he cannot help but be broken by his experiences and comes to understand that it is his own brokenness that allows him to more fully understand the need for mercy and to bring compassion to others. The book ends with Stevenson’s renewed commitment to helping others."
Polls,"Alex Claremont-Diaz is the 21-year-old son of Ellen Claremont, the first female president of the United States. Alex is highly ambitious, with his sights set on a career in politics like his mother and his father, who is a US senator. Alex is finishing his last year of college and living in the White House with his family, including his older sister June. As the novel opens, June and Alex discuss the British royal wedding, which they are about to attend, and Alex talks about how much he hates the groom’s younger brother, Prince Henry. When Alex was 12, he used to look repeatedly at a photo of Henry from one of June’s teen magazines. But when he met Henry in person, Henry was rude to him, and he’s disliked Henry ever since. At the wedding, Alex is focused on Prince Henry and is irritated by everything he does, especially when he asks June to dance for a photo opportunity. Drunk, Alex confronts Henry for acting superior, and the two end up in a physical altercation that topples the $75,000 royal wedding cake. The international incident is a scandal, and Alex is forced to pretend to be Henry’s close friend to squash rumors of a shaky relationship between the United States and Britain. 
Alex has no choice but to go along with the plan. As Alex and Henry spend more time together, however, Alex is continually surprised by Henry and finds that Henry is not at all what he expected. He’s especially moved when he sees Henry speaking warmly and openly to a young girl with cancer. Before Alex can talk to Henry about it, there’s a loud noise like gunshots, and the two are rushed into a supply closet by security. In the closet, Henry ends up apologizing for mistreating Alex in the past and says he was cold to Alex because his father had just died. Alex and Henry exchange phone numbers and start texting and talking on the phone. The Claremont-Diaz clan has a family dinner, and Ellen offers both Alex and June positions in her reelection campaign. Alex is thrilled, but June, who wants to be a journalist, declines the offer. 
Alex, June, and their best friend Nora, who is the granddaughter of the Vice President, throw their annual New Year’s Eve party. Henry attends with his best friend Pez, who is enamored of June. Everyone is having fun together, but when Henry sees Alex and Nora kiss at midnight, he gets jealous and leaves the party. Alex finds him in the garden, and Henry kisses him for the first time. This spurs a crisis of sexual identity in Alex, who can’t stop thinking about the kiss. Though Alex has had a sexual relationship with his high school friend Liam and been attracted to men, he’s never considered himself bisexual. He talks to Nora about his confusion, and she says that Henry is gay, and that Alex seems to have feelings for Henry. When Henry flies in for a dinner, Alex kisses him while a security guard keeps watch. That night, they have sex for the first time, and Alex says they are friends with benefits. Henry and Alex continue to meet up to have sex when they can get away. They also begin to write flirtatious emails to each other and have heart-to-hearts on the phone. After a night on the town with June, Nora, Henry, Pez, and Henry’s sister Bea, Alex begins to develop feelings for Henry. 
Since Alex's mother is running for reelection and because Henry is a royal, it’s crucial that Henry and Alex’s relationship remain a secret. Alex often turns to his mentor and family friend, Senator Rafael Luna, for advice to help his mother with her campaign. It’s a blow to the whole family when Luna comes out as the running mate for Ellen’s opponent, Jeffrey Richards. Alex is devastated, and Henry comes to visit Alex at the Democratic National Convention to comfort him. The next morning, Zahra, Ellen’s chief of staff and family friend, catches Henry and Alex together and agrees to keep it a secret until after the convention. Alex comes out to his mother, who creates a PowerPoint presentation as a means of talking about the dangers of his relationship with Henry. She tells him she’ll support him, but he needs to be sure the relationship is forever. He goes to his family’s lake house with Henry, June, Nora, and his father Oscar. Alex comes out to his father, too, and he realizes that he is in love with Henry. Just as he’s about to tell Henry how he feels, Henry suddenly becomes formal and fake and leaves the conversation. The next morning Henry leaves the lake house without saying goodbye, leaving only a note. 
When Henry stops responding to Alex’s texts, Alex is distraught. He flies to London to confront Henry. Henry says he can’t be in a relationship with Alex because of the royal family. They have sex, and neither of them is sure whether it is a goodbye or the beginning of their relationship. Henry gives Alex his signet ring and says he wants to be with Alex. They are happy to be together, and they send each other passionate emails when they are apart.
Suspicions about their relationship start coming out in the press, so Alex and Henry pretend to go on dates with Nora and June. It’s painful for Henry to pretend to be someone he isn’t. Then, Akex and Henry's relationship is leaked to the press, with photos of them together and their entire email history. They are both forced to go on a communication blackout, and Ellen’s team attempts to triage the situation. Alex is miserable and worried about Henry. Eventually, he flies to London. Alex and Bea help Henry confront his family, including his grandmother, the Queen. As the Queen argues that the world will never accept them, a group of people gathers outside the palace to express support for Alex and Henry’s love.  
Nora, who has been missing since the news of Alex and Henry’s relationship broke, emerges and reveals that it was the Richards campaign that leaked their photographs and emails. Alex figures out that it was Luna who tipped them off. Alex talks to Luna, and Luna reveals that Richards sexually assaulted him when he was his intern. Luna joined the campaign to expose Richards as a sexual predator. Election night is tense, and in the end, whoever wins Texas, Ellen’s home state, will win the election. Ellen wins, and Henry joins Alex onstage for her victory lap. The two leave the party and go to Alex’s house. Alex shows Henry where he grew up, letting them in with the key he always wears around his neck."
Domiciled,"Beloved begins in 1873 in Cincinnati, Ohio, where Sethe, a former slave, has been living with her eighteen-year-old daughter Denver. Sethe’s mother-in-law, Baby Suggs, lived with them until her death eight years earlier. Just before Baby Suggs’s death, Sethe’s two sons, Howard and Buglar, ran away. Sethe believes they fled because of the malevolent presence of an abusive ghost that has haunted their house at 124 Bluestone Road for years. Denver, however, likes the ghost, which everyone believes to be the spirit of her dead sister.
On the day the novel begins, Paul D, whom Sethe has not seen since they worked together on Mr. Garner’s Sweet Home plantation in Kentucky approximately twenty years earlier, stops by Sethe’s house. His presence resurrects memories that have lain buried in Sethe’s mind for almost two decades. From this point on, the story will unfold on two temporal planes. The present in Cincinnati constitutes one plane, while a series of events that took place around twenty years earlier, mostly in Kentucky, constitutes the other. This latter plane is accessed and described through the fragmented flashbacks of the major characters. Accordingly, we frequently read these flashbacks several times, sometimes from varying perspectives, with each successive narration of an event adding a little more information to the previous ones.
From these fragmented memories, the following story begins to emerge: Sethe, the protagonist, was born in the South to an African mother she never knew. When she is thirteen, she is sold to the Garners, who own Sweet Home and practice a comparatively benevolent kind of slavery. There, the other slaves, who are all men, lust after her but never touch her. Their names are Sixo, Paul D, Paul A, Paul F, and Halle. Sethe chooses to marry Halle, apparently in part because he has proven generous enough to buy his mother’s freedom by hiring himself out on the weekends. Together, Sethe and Halle have two sons, Howard and Buglar, as well as a baby daughter whose name we never learn. When she leaves Sweet Home, Sethe is also pregnant with a fourth child. After the eventual death of the proprietor, Mr. Garner, the widowed Mrs. Garner asks her sadistic, vehemently racist brother-in-law to help her run the farm. He is known to the slaves as schoolteacher, and his oppressive presence makes life on the plantation even more unbearable than it had been before. The slaves decide to run.
Schoolteacher and his nephews anticipate the slaves’ escape, however, and capture Paul D and Sixo. Schoolteacher kills Sixo and brings Paul D back to Sweet Home, where Paul D sees Sethe for what he believes will be the last time. She is still intent on running, having already sent her children ahead to her mother-in-law Baby Suggs’s house in Cincinnati. Invigorated by the recent capture, schoolteacher’s nephews seize Sethe in the barn and violate her, stealing the milk her body is storing for her infant daughter. Unbeknownst to Sethe, Halle is watching the event from a loft above her, where he lies frozen with horror. Afterward, Halle goes mad: Paul D sees him sitting by a churn with butter slathered all over his face. Paul D, meanwhile, is forced to suffer the indignity of wearing an iron bit in his mouth.
When schoolteacher finds out that Sethe has reported his and his nephews’ misdeeds to Mrs. Garner, he has her whipped severely, despite the fact that she is pregnant. Swollen and scarred, Sethe nevertheless runs away, but along the way she collapses from exhaustion in a forest. A white girl, Amy Denver, finds her and nurses her back to health. When Amy later helps Sethe deliver her baby in a boat, Sethe names this second daughter Denver after the girl who helped her. Sethe receives further help from Stamp Paid, who rows her across the Ohio River to Baby Suggs’s house. Baby Suggs cleans Sethe up before allowing her to see her three older children.
Sethe spends twenty-eight wonderful days in Cincinnati, where Baby Suggs serves as an unofficial preacher to the black community. On the last day, however, schoolteacher comes for Sethe to take her and her children back to Sweet Home. Rather than surrender her children to a life of dehumanizing slavery, she flees with them to the woodshed and tries to kill them. Only the third child, her older daughter, dies, her throat having been cut with a handsaw by Sethe. Sethe later arranges for the baby’s headstone to be carved with the word “Beloved.” The sheriff takes Sethe and Denver to jail, but a group of white abolitionists, led by the Bodwins, fights for her release. Sethe returns to the house at 124, where Baby Suggs has sunk into a deep depression. The community shuns the house, and the family continues to live in isolation.
Meanwhile, Paul D has endured torturous experiences in a chain gang in Georgia, where he was sent after trying to kill Brandywine, a slave owner to whom he was sold by schoolteacher. His traumatic experiences have caused him to lock away his memories, emotions, and ability to love in the “tin tobacco box” of his heart. One day, a fortuitous rainstorm allows Paul D and the other chain gang members to escape. He travels northward by following the blossoming spring flowers. Years later, he ends up on Sethe’s porch in Cincinnati.
Paul D’s arrival at 124 commences the series of events taking place in the present time frame. Prior to moving in, Paul D chases the house’s resident ghost away, which makes the already lonely Denver resent him from the start. Sethe and Paul D look forward to a promising future together, until one day, on their way home from a carnival, they encounter a strange young woman sleeping near the steps of 124. Most of the characters believe that the woman—who calls herself Beloved—is the embodied spirit of Sethe’s dead daughter, and the novel provides a wealth of evidence supporting this interpretation. Denver develops an obsessive attachment to Beloved, and Beloved’s attachment to Sethe is equally if not more intense. Paul D and Beloved hate each other, and Beloved controls Paul D by moving him around the house like a rag doll and by seducing him against his will.
When Paul D learns the story of Sethe’s “rough choice”—her infanticide—he leaves 124 and begins sleeping in the basement of the local church. In his absence, Sethe and Beloved’s relationship becomes more intense and exclusive. Beloved grows increasingly abusive, manipulative, and parasitic, and Sethe is obsessed with satisfying Beloved’s demands and making her understand why she murdered her. Worried by the way her mother is wasting away, Denver leaves the premises of 124 for the first time in twelve years in order to seek help from Lady Jones, her former teacher. The community provides the family with food and eventually organizes under the leadership of Ella, a woman who had worked on the Underground Railroad and helped with Sethe’s escape, in order to exorcise Beloved from 124. When they arrive at Sethe’s house, they see Sethe on the porch with Beloved, who stands smiling at them, naked and pregnant. Mr. Bodwin, who has come to 124 to take Denver to her new job, arrives at the house. Mistaking him for schoolteacher, Sethe runs at Mr. Bodwin with an ice pick. She is restrained, but in the confusion Beloved disappears, never to return.
Afterward, Paul D comes back to Sethe, who has retreated to Baby Suggs’s bed to die. Mourning Beloved, Sethe laments, “She was my best thing.” But Paul D replies, “You your best thing, Sethe.” The novel then ends with a warning that “[t]his is not a story to pass on.” The town, and even the residents of 124, have forgotten Beloved “[l]ike an unpleasant dream during a troubling sleep.”"
Limb,"Mary Maloney is a homemaker sitting alone and working on her sewing in her quiet, orderly house as she waits for her husband Patrick, a police detective, to come home from work. Mary is six months pregnant. It is Thursday evening, the night of the couple typically goes out to eat, and Mary has the set-up for pre-dinner cocktails already prepared.
When her husband arrives, Mary greets him warmly. But her repeated offers of affectionate attention are all rebuked by clipped and dispassionate responses from Patrick. She prepares a weak cocktail for herself and a stronger one for Patrick who, uncharacteristically, downs the drink quickly, then pours and consumes a more potent second drink. Quietly alarmed, Mary suggests that Patrick eat some crackers and cheese, which he refuses. Mary then offers to forego their date night and prepare a home-cooked supper, suggesting, perhaps, some lamb chops or pork from the freezer downstairs. Patrick ignores the offer and orders Mary to sit down; he has something to tell her. At this point, her alarm turns to fear.
Patrick attempts to prepare Mary for some shocking news, claiming he has thought about it a lot and that he thinks it best to simply blurt it all out. Though his confession is not specified in the narrative, it becomes clear that Patrick intends to leave Mary. Patrick admits he knows his confession comes at a bad time, presumably, though he doesn’t say so directly, because Mary is pregnant. He tells her he will continue to provide her with financial support, and that he hopes everything will be handled discreetly because otherwise it would be bad for his job.
At first, Mary is stunned and uncertain. She decides that if she behaves as if nothing has happened, she can perhaps undo the damage. Without any direct verbal response to what he has said, she tells Patrick that she is going downstairs to get the meat for dinner, and he does not deter her. Hollowed and stupefied, Mary descends the steps to the cellar, retrieves a leg of lamb from the freezer, and carries it upstairs to prepare a meal. She sees Patrick standing near the window with his back to her. Without turning around, Patrick tells Mary that it is ludicrous to make dinner for him because he is going out.
Upon hearing these words, Mary walks up behind Patrick and brings the frozen leg of lamb down on his head in one unmitigated blow. His body undulates as if in slow motion, then drops dead to the floor, overturning a small table.
In the minutes after the killing, Mary gradually returns to full lucidity. She contemplates with neither concern nor regret, only resignation, that she may be executed for what she has done. It occurs to her to wonder what may happen to the unborn child of a pregnant murderer, and she immediately resolves to be proactive about her situation. She carries the meat into the kitchen, turns on the oven, and places the leg of lamb inside. Mary then practices her smile and tone of voice. It becomes clear that she is rehearsing to purchase potatoes and peas from a grocer named Sam.
Mary hurries out onto the street and goes to the grocery store where she addresses Sam, using the exact dialogue she rehearsed earlier. Sam is clearly familiar with Mr. and Mrs. Maloney, so Mary refers to her husband by his first name and tells Sam that Patrick has decided he is too tired to go out to eat tonight. Sam is attentive, and the two confirm that Mary has already started cooking a frozen leg of lamb.
As she returns home, Mary mentally prepares herself for the cover-up she must create in order to deflect suspicion and make Patrick’s death appear to be the result of an encounter with an unknown murderer. She goes so far as to call out to Patrick as if he could answer her, and the “discovery” of his body causes Mary to experience real, cathartic emotion that plays naturally into her overall charade.
Mary then proceeds to phone the police station where Patrick works, reporting in a heightened state of urgency that she thinks her husband is dead. The police officers who quickly arrive at her house are Sergeant Jack Noonan, whom Mary knows well, and another named O’Malley. Noonan is kind and chivalrous to Mary, as are all the investigators who show up including a doctor, two detectives, a police photographer, a fingerprint expert, and a few others. They sweep through and around the house, asking Mary questions and inspecting the crime scene. Two attendants arrive and remove the corpse. As the minutes pass, Mary picks up on every subtlety of the procedures. She takes in snatches of hushed conversation regarding the investigation, including notations from a brief interview with Sam, the grocer.
Eventually, Noonan suggests Mary find a place to stay and offers to let Mary stay in his own home with him and his wife. Mary rejects the offer, saying that she is too emotionally spent to move from her chair. The number of investigators begins to dwindle, but the process continues around her as Noonan explains that the focus is now on finding the murder weapon. The police believe it must be a large, heavy metal object that is likely still somewhere on the premises.
Mary suggests that a few sips of whiskey might have restorative powers for her. As Noonan accommodates her request, she proposes that perhaps he and the few remaining investigators might also be restored by a small drink. Hesitantly, each of the men accepts. Noonan points out that the leg of lamb is still cooking and offers to turn off the oven. Grateful, Mary expresses to Noonan that the investigative team must be hungry by now, and that the departed Patrick would want her to be hospitable to his colleagues. They would be doing her a great favor if they would dine on the now fully cooked lamb, which she can no longer bring herself to eat.
Though reluctant to accept at first, the team is genuinely hungry and they ultimately acquiesce. While seated around the kitchen table, they engage in a hearty discussion about how the doctor’s report on the deathblow indicates that the murder weapon must have been heavy, too awkward to be easily removed, and is probably somewhere nearby. Oblivious, they eat the leg of lamb while they talk, unaware that the murder weapon is indeed right under their noses.
Mary, still seated in the living room, listens and giggles quietly to herself."
Court,"An ambitious, worldly young bank official named Joseph K. is arrested by two warders ""one fine morning,"" although he has done nothing wrong. K. is indignant and outraged. The morning happens to be that of his thirtieth birthday. One year later, on the morning of his thirty-first birthday, two warders again come for K. They take him to a quarry outside of town and kill him in the name of the Law. K. lets them.

The Trial is the chronicle of that intervening year of K.'s case, his struggles and encounters with the invisible Law and the untouchable Court. It is an account, ultimately, of state-induced self-destruction. Yet, as in all of Kafka's best writing, the ""meaning"" is far from clear. Just as the parable related by the chaplain in Chapter Nine (called ""The Doorkeeper"" or ""Before the Law"") elicits endless commentary from students of the Law, so has The Trial been a touchstone of twentieth-century critical interpretation. As some commentators have noted, it has, in parts, the quality of revealed truth; as such it is ultimately unresolvable--a mirror for any sectarian reading.
How to summarize this kind of text? It was written during 1914-1915, while Kafka was an official in the Workmen's Accident Insurance Institute for the Kingdom of Bohemia. On one level we can see in The Trial a satirical pillorying of the Austro-Hungarian bureaucracy of Kafka's day. Yet to many readers it is eerily prescient of the psychological weaponry used by the much more insidious totalitarian regimes to come, of the legally-sanctioned death machines Kafka never lived to see. It is also an unfinished novel, and this is apparent in the final chapters. It is at times as suffocating to read as the airless rooms of the Court that it describes. The German title, Der Prozess, connotes both a ""trial"" and a ""process,"" and it is perhaps this maddening feeling of inevitability that leaves a lasting visceral impression: the machinery has been set in motion, and the process will grind toward conclusion despite our most desperate exhortations."
Progress,"The narrator defends the story he is about to tell, which is framed as a dream. He explains that he fell asleep in the wilderness and dreamed of a man named Christian, who was tormented by spiritual anguish. A spiritual guide named Evangelist visits Christian and urges him to leave the City of Destruction. Evangelist claims that salvation can only be found in the Celestial City, known as Mount Zion.
Christian begs his family to accompany him, unsuccessfully. On his way, Christian falls into a bog called the Slough of Despond, but he is saved. He meets Worldly Wiseman, who urges him to lead a practical, happy existence without religion. Refusing, Christian is sheltered in Goodwill’s house. Goodwill tells Christian to stop by the Interpreter’s home, where Christian learns many lessons about faith.
Walking along the wall of Salvation, Christian sees Christ’s tomb and cross. At this vision, his burden falls to the ground. One of the three Shining Ones, celestial creatures, hands him a rolled certificate for entry to the Celestial City. Christian falls asleep and loses his certificate. Since the certificate is his ticket into the Celestial City, Christian reproaches himself for losing it. After retracing his tracks, he eventually finds the certificate. Walking on, Christian meets the four mistresses of the Palace Beautiful, who provide him shelter. They also feed him and arm him. After descending the Valley of Humiliation, Christian meets the monster Apollyon, who tries to kill him. Christian is armed, and he strikes Apollyon with a sword and then proceeds through the desert-like Valley of the Shadow of Death toward the Celestial City.
Christian meets Faithful, a traveler from his hometown. Faithful and Christian are joined by a third pilgrim, Talkative, whom Christian spurns. Evangelist arrives and warns Faithful and Christian about the wicked town of Vanity, which they will soon enter. Evangelist foretells that either Christian or Faithful will die in Vanity.
The two enter Vanity and visit its famous fair. They resist temptation and are mocked by the townspeople. Eventually the citizens of Vanity imprison Christian and Faithful for mocking their local religion. Faithful defends himself at his trial and is executed, rising to heaven after death. Christian is remanded to prison but later escapes and continues his journey.
Another fellow pilgrim named Hopeful befriends Christian on his way. On their journey, a pilgrim who uses religion as a means to get ahead in the world, named By-ends, crosses their path. Christian rejects his company. The two enter the plain of Ease, where a smooth talker named Demas tempts them with silver. Christian and Hopeful pass him by.
Taking shelter for the night on the grounds of Doubting Castle, they awake to the threats of the castle’s owner, the Giant Despair, who, with the encouragement of his wife, imprisons and tortures them. Christian and Hopeful escape when they remember they possess the key of Promise, which unlocks any door in Despair’s domain.
Proceeding onward, Christian and Hopeful approach the Delectable Mountains near the Celestial City. They encounter wise shepherds who warn them of the treacherous mountains Error and Caution, where previous pilgrims have died. The shepherds point out travelers who wander among tombs nearby, having been blinded by the Giant Despair. They warn the travelers to beware of shortcuts, which may be paths to hell.
The two pilgrims meet Ignorance, a sprightly teenager who believes that living a good life is sufficient to prove one’s religious faith. Christian refutes him, and Ignorance decides to avoid their company. The travelers also meet Flatterer, who snares them in a net, and Atheist, who denies that the Celestial City exists. Crossing the sleep-inducing Enchanted Ground, they try to stay awake by discussing Hopeful’s sinful past and religious doctrine.
Christian and Hopeful gleefully approach the land of Beulah, where the Celestial City is located. The landscape teems with flowers and fruit, and the travelers are refreshed. To reach the gate into the city, they must first cross a river without a bridge. Christian nearly drowns, but Hopeful reminds him of Christ’s love, and Christian emerges safely from the water. The residents of the Celestial City joyously welcome the two pilgrims. In his conclusion to Part I, the narrator expresses hope that his dream be interpreted properly.
In the Introduction to Part II, Bunyan addresses the book as “Christiana,” which is the name of Christian’s wife. This part of The Pilgrim’s Progress tells the story of Christiana and her children’s journey to the Celestial City. The narrator recounts having met an old man, Sagacity, who tells the beginning of Christiana’s story. She decides to pack up and follow Christian to the Celestial City, taking her four sons and a fellow townswoman named Mercy along as a servant. On the way, they cross the Slough of Despond but are blocked at the gate by an angry dog. The gatekeeper lets them through. Continuing on, the sons steal fruit from the devil’s garden, and two ruffians threaten to rape the women, but they escape.
The pilgrims are lodged in the Interpreter’s house. The Interpreter orders his manservant Great-heart to accompany them to the House Beautiful. Mr. Brisk pays court to Mercy but soon stops courting her because of her involvement in charity work. As a result of eating the devil’s fruit, Matthew falls ill but is cured by Dr. Skill. The pilgrims descend into the Valley of Humiliation and cross the Valley of the Shadow of Death. They encounter the giant Maul and slay him. After meeting the old pilgrim Honest, they take shelter with Gaius. The pilgrims continue on their journey and kill the Giant Good-slay then rescue the pilgrims Feeble-mind and Ready-to-Halt. They lodge with Mnason. Crossing the river of life, they kill the Giant Despair and greet the kind shepherds who welcome them into the Delectable Mountains.
Christiana meets the great fighter Valiant-for-truth, who accompanies them. They cross the Enchanted Ground and meet the pilgrim Standfast, who has just spurned Madam Bubble, a beautiful temptress. The pilgrims are welcomed in the Celestial City. Christiana goes to meet her maker, the Master. The other pilgrims soon follow."
Taxing,"The epic’s prelude offers a general introduction to Gilgamesh, king of Uruk, who was two-thirds god and one-third man. He built magnificent ziggurats, or temple towers, surrounded his city with high walls, and laid out its orchards and fields. He was physically beautiful, immensely strong, and very wise. Although Gilgamesh was godlike in body and mind, he began his kingship as a cruel despot. He lorded over his subjects, raping any woman who struck his fancy, whether she was the wife of one of his warriors or the daughter of a nobleman. He accomplished his building projects with forced labor, and his exhausted subjects groaned under his oppression. The gods heard his subjects’ pleas and decided to keep Gilgamesh in check by creating a wild man named Enkidu, who was as magnificent as Gilgamesh. Enkidu became Gilgamesh’s great friend, and Gilgamesh’s heart was shattered when Enkidu died of an illness inflicted by the gods. Gilgamesh then traveled to the edge of the world and learned about the days before the deluge and other secrets of the gods, and he recorded them on stone tablets.
The epic begins with Enkidu. He lives with the animals, suckling at their breasts, grazing in the meadows, and drinking at their watering places. A hunter discovers him and sends a temple prostitute into the wilderness to tame him. In that time, people considered women and sex calming forces that could domesticate wild men like Enkidu and bring them into the civilized world. When Enkidu sleeps with the woman, the animals reject him since he is no longer one of them. Now, he is part of the human world. Then the harlot teaches him everything he needs to know to be a man. Enkidu is outraged by what he hears about Gilgamesh’s excesses, so he travels to Uruk to challenge him. When he arrives, Gilgamesh is about to force his way into a bride’s wedding chamber. Enkidu steps into the doorway and blocks his passage. The two men wrestle fiercely for a long time, and Gilgamesh finally prevails. After that, they become friends and set about looking for an adventure to share. 
Gilgamesh and Enkidu decide to steal trees from a distant cedar forest forbidden to mortals. A terrifying demon named Humbaba, the devoted servant of Enlil, the god of earth, wind, and air, guards it. The two heroes make the perilous journey to the forest, and, standing side by side, fight with the monster. With assistance from Shamash the sun god, they kill him. Then they cut down the forbidden trees, fashion the tallest into an enormous gate, make the rest into a raft, and float on it back to Uruk. Upon their return, Ishtar, the goddess of love, is overcome with lust for Gilgamesh. Gilgamesh spurns her. Enraged, the goddess asks her father, Anu, the god of the sky, to send the Bull of Heaven to punish him. The bull comes down from the sky, bringing with him seven years of famine. Gilgamesh and Enkidu wrestle with the bull and kill it. The gods meet in council and agree that one of the two friends must be punished for their transgression, and they decide Enkidu is going to die. He takes ill, suffers immensely, and shares his visions of the underworld with Gilgamesh. When he finally dies, Gilgamesh is heartbroken.
Gilgamesh can’t stop grieving for Enkidu, and he can’t stop brooding about the prospect of his own death. Exchanging his kingly garments for animal skins as a way of mourning Enkidu, he sets off into the wilderness, determined to find Utnapishtim, the Mesopotamian Noah. After the flood, the gods had granted Utnapishtim eternal life, and Gilgamesh hopes that Utnapishtim can tell him how he might avoid death too. Gilgamesh’s journey takes him to the twin-peaked mountain called Mashu, where the sun sets into one side of the mountain at night and rises out of the other side in the morning. Utnapishtim lives beyond the mountain, but the two scorpion monsters that guard its entrance refuse to allow Gilgamesh into the tunnel that passes through it. Gilgamesh pleads with them, and they relent. 
After a harrowing passage through total darkness, Gilgamesh emerges into a beautiful garden by the sea. There he meets Siduri, a veiled tavern keeper, and tells her about his quest. She warns him that seeking immortality is futile and that he should be satisfied with the pleasures of this world. However, when she can’t turn him away from his purpose, she directs him to Urshanabi, the ferryman. Urshanabi takes Gilgamesh on the boat journey across the sea and through the Waters of Death to Utnapishtim. Utnapishtim tells Gilgamesh the story of the flood—how the gods met in council and decided to destroy humankind. Ea, the god of wisdom, warned Utnapishtim about the gods’ plans and told him how to fashion a gigantic boat in which his family and the seed of every living creature might escape. When the waters finally receded, the gods regretted what they’d done and agreed that they would never try to destroy humankind again. Utnapishtim was rewarded with eternal life. Men would die, but humankind would continue. 
When Gilgamesh insists that he be allowed to live forever, Utnapishtim gives him a test. If you think you can stay alive for eternity, he says, surely you can stay awake for a week. Gilgamesh tries and immediately fails. So Utnapishtim orders him to clean himself up, put on his royal garments again, and return to Uruk where he belongs. Just as Gilgamesh is departing, however, Utnapishtim’s wife convinces him to tell Gilgamesh about a miraculous plant that restores youth. Gilgamesh finds the plant and takes it with him, planning to share it with the elders of Uruk. But a snake steals the plant one night while they are camping. As the serpent slithers away, it sheds its skin and becomes young again. 
When Gilgamesh returns to Uruk, he is empty-handed but reconciled at last to his mortality. He knows that he can’t live forever but that humankind will. Now he sees that the city he had repudiated in his grief and terror is a magnificent, enduring achievement—the closest thing to immortality to which a mortal can aspire."
Mixed,"In Born a Crime: Stories from a South African Childhood, comedian and television personality Trevor Noah gives a heartfelt and funny recounting of his experiences growing up in South Africa as an oppressed person. Stories of Noah’s life are interspersed with insights into South Africa’s culture, systems, and history. Noah was born in 1984 to a single mother, Patricia, during the time of racial segregation known as apartheid. Patricia was a strong, driven woman who paid little heed to the racist laws that oppressed her. Noah’s father, Robert, agreed to give Patricia a child during a time when sexual relationships between black and white South Africans were illegal. Robert, a Swiss immigrant, never supported segregation and did what he could to undermine apartheid. Because it was dangerous for Patricia and Robert to be seen with their mixed-race child, Noah recalls sometimes being momentarily abandoned by his parents in public settings.
Dutch colonizers came to South Africa in the 1600s and used slave labor to run their farms on stolen land. The white South Africans called Afrikaners are descended from these colonizers. Black South Africans, from tribes including the Zulu, Xhosa, and Sotho tribes, were subjugated under apartheid law until the mid-1990s. A third racial group emerged from the intermingling of the Black and white South Africans: mixed-race or “colored.” Both during apartheid and after its dissolution, mixed-race South Africans were the most marginalized and disenfranchised people. Noah often felt defined by what he wasn’t: not light enough to be labeled as white and not dark enough to be fully accepted into Black culture.
Apartheid ended in 1994, but Noah’s struggles as a mixed-race child in South Africa continued. It was often hard for Noah to determine which groups would accept him. Patricia had always encouraged her son to read and think independently; she valued education and made sure that her son spoke multiple languages. Of the eleven official languages in South Africa, Noah could speak Zulu, Tsonga, English, and Afrikaans. This skill allowed him to move among different racial and cultural groups at school. Though Noah felt out of place in many social settings, his ability to talk and empathize with many different types of people served him well throughout his life. Even at a young age, Noah understood that the bullying he experienced from his mixed-race peers was likely a result of the self-hatred all mixed-race South Africans had been taught. Noah was a mischievous child, but Patricia believed in tempering her punishments with assurances to her son that she held him accountable because she loved him. Patricia knew that the world would not always be kind and generous to Noah, and she wanted to prepare him well.
During his high school years, Noah acquired a small bootleg CD business from a friend. Noah soon found that he could make more money working with his friend Sizwe, who was from the poorer, crowded Johannesburg township called Alexandra—known to most residents as Alex. After graduation Noah moved to Alex to expand his profits, with Sizwe’s help. Sizwe recognized that Noah had talent as a live DJ, and the pair formed a performance group. Noah and his group sold bootleg and mixed CDs, dealt in stolen goods, performed at parties and concerts, and did their best to avoid confrontations with local law enforcement. Noah was already familiar with the South African police. Patricia received no help from the local police when she tried to file charges against her abusive husband. Noah was arrested for shoplifting, on suspicion of carrying a weapon, and for driving an unregistered vehicle. One arrest kept Noah in jail for several days, and Patricia had to pay for his lawyer. Despite his dealings with law enforcement, Noah could see his own privilege in comparison to many of his peers. Patricia had worked hard to make sure her son had the ability to make a life for himself.
The men in Noah’s life taught him little about how to interact with women. Robert was a distant but generally pleasant presence. Patricia’s father, Temperance Noah, was an unpredictable figure. Later, Noah would learn that his grandfather had bipolar disorder and would often beat his wife, Frances. Patricia experienced abuse in her marriage as well. Noah’s stepfather, Abel, became acquainted with Patricia and her young son during their many visits to the automotive shop where Abel worked on their run-down car. After Abel and Patricia married, he bought the shop. Patricia was forced to sell her home to keep the business running, and the family spent a stressful year living in the shop warehouse. Abel often came home drunk, and he began beating his wife. Once Abel had sons of his own, Noah’s half-brothers Andrew and Isaac, Abel’s hostility toward Patricia’s oldest son grew. When Patricia learned that her violent husband had bought a gun, she helped Noah move out on his own. 
One day, Noah received a phone call from Andrew with news that Abel, now estranged from his family, had come to Patricia’s new house and shot her in the head as she was shielding Andrew and Isaac. Miraculously, Patricia survived. Noah was able to cover her medical bills, and Patricia thanked God for protecting her and giving her a son who could afford to help her."
Renders,"NOTE: Although Night is not necessarily a memoir, this SparkNotes guide often refers to it as one, since the work’s mixture of testimony, deposition, and emotional truth-telling renders it similar to works in the memoir genre. It is clear that Eliezer is meant to serve, to a great extent, as author Elie Wiesel’s stand-in and representative. Minor details have been altered, but what happens to Eliezer is what happened to Wiesel himself during the Holocaust. It is important to remember, however, that there is a difference between the persona of narrator of Night, Eliezer, and that of its author, Elie Wiesel.
Night is narrated by Eliezer, a Jewish teenager who, when the memoir begins, lives in his hometown of Sighet, in Hungarian Transylvania. Eliezer studies the Torah (the first five books of the Old Testament) and the Kabbalah (a doctrine of Jewish mysticism). His instruction is cut short, however, when his teacher, Moishe the Beadle, is deported. In a few months, Moishe returns, telling a horrifying tale: the Gestapo (the German secret police force) took charge of his train, led everyone into the woods, and systematically butchered them. Nobody believes Moishe, who is taken for a lunatic.
In the spring of 1944, the Nazis occupy Hungary. Not long afterward, a series of increasingly repressive measures are passed, and the Jews of Eliezer’s town are forced into small ghettos within Sighet. Soon they are herded onto cattle cars, and a nightmarish journey ensues. After days and nights crammed into the car, exhausted and near starvation, the passengers arrive at Birkenau, the gateway to Auschwitz.
Upon his arrival in Birkenau, Eliezer and his father are separated from his mother and sisters, whom they never see again. In the first of many “selections” that Eliezer describes in the memoir, the Jews are evaluated to determine whether they should be killed immediately or put to work. Eliezer and his father seem to pass the evaluation, but before they are brought to the prisoners’ barracks, they stumble upon the open-pit furnaces where the Nazis are burning babies by the truckload.
The Jewish arrivals are stripped, shaved, disinfected, and treated with almost unimaginable cruelty. Eventually, their captors march them from Birkenau to the main camp, Auschwitz. They eventually arrive in Buna, a work camp, where Eliezer is put to work in an electrical-fittings factory. Under slave-labor conditions, severely malnourished and decimated by the frequent “selections,” the Jews take solace in caring for each other, in religion, and in Zionism, a movement favoring the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine, considered the holy land. In the camp, the Jews are subject to beatings and repeated humiliations. A vicious foreman forces Eliezer to give him his gold tooth, which is pried out of his mouth with a rusty spoon.
The prisoners are forced to watch the hanging of fellow prisoners in the camp courtyard. On one occasion, the Gestapo even hang a small child who had been associated with some rebels within Buna. Because of the horrific conditions in the camps and the ever-present danger of death, many of the prisoners themselves begin to slide into cruelty, concerned only with personal survival. Sons begin to abandon and abuse their fathers. Eliezer himself begins to lose his humanity and his faith, both in God and in the people around him.
After months in the camp, Eliezer undergoes an operation for a foot injury. While he is in the infirmary, however, the Nazis decide to evacuate the camp because the Russians are advancing and are on the verge of liberating Buna. In the middle of a snowstorm, the prisoners begin a death march: they are forced to run for more than fifty miles to the Gleiwitz concentration camp. Many die of exposure to the harsh weather and exhaustion. At Gleiwitz, the prisoners are herded into cattle cars once again. They begin another deadly journey: one hundred Jews board the car, but only twelve remain alive when the train reaches the concentration camp Buchenwald. Throughout the ordeal, Eliezer and his father help each other to survive by means of mutual support and concern. In Buchenwald, however, Eliezer’s father dies of dysentery and physical abuse. Eliezer survives, an empty shell of a man until April 11, 1945, the day that the American army liberates the camp."

Covenants,"The Old Testament is a collection of thirty-nine books about the history and religion of the people of Israel. The authors of these books are unknown, and each book possesses a unique tone, style, and message. Individually, they include stories, laws, and sayings that are intended to function as models of religious and ethical conduct. Together—through hundreds of characters and detailed events—they represent a unified narrative about God and his attempt to relate to humankind by relating to a specific group of people.
The Old Testament contains four main sections: the Pentateuch, the Former Prophets (or Historical Books), the Writings, and the Latter Prophets. This study guide covers books from the first three sections.
The Pentateuch
The Pentateuch comprises the first five books of the Old Testament. It depicts a series of beginnings—the beginning of the world, of humankind, and of God’s promise to the Israelites.
Genesis, the first book, opens with God’s creation of the world. The perfect world falls into evil when humans disobey God, and the human population divides into separate nations and languages. After many generations, God speaks to a man named Abraham. God makes a promise, or covenant, with Abraham to make his descendants into a great nation and to give them a great land. Abraham shows strong faith in God, and God seals his promise with a number of signs and tests. This special covenant with God passes on to Abraham’s son, Isaac, and to his grandson, Jacob. Together, they represent the patriarchs, or fathers, of the Israelite people. Jacob’s twelve sons move to Egypt after the youngest brother, Joseph, miraculously becomes a high official in Egypt.
In the Book of Exodus, the descendants of Jacob’s children have become a vast people, but the Pharaoh of Egypt holds them in slavery. God chooses one man, Moses, to rescue the Israelites. God sends ten plagues to Egypt, and, with miraculous signs and wonders, Moses leads the people out of Egypt and across the Red Sea. They go to Mount Sinai, where God appears in a cloud of thunder over the mountain and affirms to the Israelites the promise he made to Abraham. God commands them to worship only himself, and he gives them various ethical and religious laws.
The books of Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy continue the explanation of God’s religious laws and his promises to the people. The people must keep these laws to enter and enjoy the promised land, toward which they are heading. Despite God’s presence, the Israelites complain and disobey incessantly, inciting God’s wrath. They wander the wilderness for forty years in search of the promised land. These books continue the period of Moses’s legendary leadership and miracles, until his death at the end of Deuteronomy.
The Former Prophets
The Former Prophets, or the Historical Books, cover the history of the Israelites from Moses’s death to the fall of the nation in 587 b.c. In the books of Joshua and Judges, the Israelites successfully conquer the land promised to them by God, but they disobey God by worshipping the deities of the surrounding peoples. Neighboring nations invade and oppress the Israelites. God saves the people of Israel by designating judges, or rulers, to lead the people in warding off their enemies.
The two books of Samuel (First Samuel and Second Samuel) cover the rise of the united kingdom of Israel. Israel’s religious leader, Samuel, appoints a king named Saul. Saul disobeys God, however, and God chooses another man, David, to be Israel’s king. King Saul attempts to kill the young David, but fails. Saul’s death closes the first book. In the second book, David establishes the great kingdom of Israel. He conquers Israel’s surrounding enemies and establishes Jerusalem as the religious and political center of Israel.
The books of Kings (called 1 Kings and 2 Kings) trace the decline of Israel’s success. God blesses David’s son, Solomon, with immense wisdom. As king, Solomon expands Israel into an empire and builds a great temple in Jerusalem. Solomon disobeys God by worshipping other deities, and, at his death, the kingdom splits into a northern kingdom, Israel, and a southern kingdom, Judah. A host of evil kings leads the two kingdoms away from worshipping God. Despite the attempts of the prophets Elijah and Elisha to halt Israel’s wrongdoing, the two kingdoms fall to the Assyrian and Babylonian Empires. Jerusalem is destroyed, and the people are sent into exile.
The Writings
The Writings are placed after the historical books in the Christian Bible. Some of these are narratives covering the time of Israel’s exile in other nations and its eventual return to the homeland. The Book of Esther, for example, tells the story of an unassuming Jewish girl who becomes the queen of Persia and boldly saves the Jewish people from genocide.
Many of the Writings are books of poetry and wisdom, among the most important literature in the Old Testament. The Book of Job is a lengthy dialogue investigating God’s justice and the problem of human suffering. The Psalms are lyrical poems and hymns—many attributed to King David—that express humankind’s longing for God. The books of Proverbs and Ecclesiastes—similarly attributed to the wise King Solomon—offer sayings and instructions about the meaning of life and ethical behavior. Lastly, the Song of Solomon (also attributed to Solomon) is a romantic, lyric dialogue between a young woman and her lover."
Simplify,"The full title of Swift's pamphlet is ""A Modest Proposal for Preventing the Children of Poor People from Being a Burthen to their Parents, or the Country, and for Making them Beneficial to the Publick."" The tract is an ironically conceived attempt to ""find out a fair, cheap, and easy Method"" for converting the starving children of Ireland into ""sound and useful members of the Commonwealth."" Across the country poor children, predominantly Catholics, are living in squalor because their families are too poor to keep them fed and clothed.
The author argues, by hard-edged economic reasoning as well as from a self-righteous moral stance, for a way to turn this problem into its own solution. His proposal, in effect, is to fatten up these undernourished children and feed them to Ireland's rich land-owners. Children of the poor could be sold into a meat market at the age of one, he argues, thus combating overpopulation and unemployment, sparing families the expense of child-bearing while providing them with a little extra income, improving the culinary experience of the wealthy, and contributing to the overall economic well-being of the nation.
The author offers statistical support for his assertions and gives specific data about the number of children to be sold, their weight and price, and the projected consumption patterns. He suggests some recipes for preparing this delicious new meat, and he feels sure that innovative cooks will be quick to generate more. He also anticipates that the practice of selling and eating children will have positive effects on family morality: husbands will treat their wives with more respect, and parents will value their children in ways hitherto unknown. His conclusion is that the implementation of this project will do more to solve Ireland's complex social, political, and economic problems than any other measure that has been proposed."
Work,"Walden opens with a simple announcement that Thoreau spent two years in Walden Pond, near Concord, Massachusetts, living a simple life supported by no one. He says that he now resides among the civilized again; the episode was clearly both experimental and temporary. The first chapter, “Economy,” is a manifesto of social thought and meditations on domestic management, and in it Thoreau sketches out his ideals as he describes his pond project. He devotes attention to the skepticism and wonderment with which townspeople had greeted news of his project, and he defends himself from their views that society is the only place to live. He recounts the circumstances of his move to Walden Pond, along with a detailed account of the steps he took to construct his rustic habitation and the methods by which he supported himself in the course of his wilderness experiment. It is a chapter full of facts, figures, and practical advice, but also offers big ideas about the claims of individualism versus social existence, all interspersed with evidence of scholarship and a propensity for humor.
Thoreau tells us that he completed his cabin in the spring of 1845 and moved in on July 4 of that year. Most of the materials and tools he used to build his home he borrowed or scrounged from previous sites. The land he squats on belongs to his friend Ralph Waldo Emerson; he details a cost-analysis of the entire construction project. In order to make a little money, Thoreau cultivates a modest bean-field, a job that tends to occupy his mornings. He reserves his afternoons and evenings for contemplation, reading, and walking about the countryside. Endorsing the values of austerity, simplicity, and solitude, Thoreau consistently emphasizes the minimalism of his lifestyle and the contentment to be derived from it. He repeatedly contrasts his own freedom with the imprisonment of others who devote their lives to material prosperity.
Despite his isolation, Thoreau feels the presence of society surrounding him. The Fitchburg Railroad rushes past Walden Pond, interrupting his reveries and forcing him to contemplate the power of technology. Thoreau also finds occasion to converse with a wide range of other people, such as the occasional peasant farmer, railroad worker, or the odd visitor to Walden. He describes in some detail his association with a Canadian-born woodcutter, Alex Therien, who is grand and sincere in his character, though modest in intellectual attainments. Thoreau makes frequent trips into Concord to seek the society of his longtime friends and to conduct what scattered business the season demands. On one such trip, Thoreau spends a night in jail for refusing to pay a poll tax because, he says, the government supports slavery. Released the next day, Thoreau returns to Walden.
Thoreau devotes great attention to nature, the passing of the seasons, and the creatures with which he shares the woods. He recounts the habits of a panoply of animals, from woodchucks to partridges. Some he endows with a larger meaning, often spiritual or psychological. The hooting loon that plays hide and seek with Thoreau, for instance, becomes a symbol of the playfulness of nature and its divine laughter at human endeavors. Another example of animal symbolism is the full-fledged ant war that Thoreau stumbles upon, prompting him to meditate on human warfare. Thoreau’s interest in animals is not exactly like the naturalist’s or zoologist’s. He does not observe and describe them neutrally and scientifically, but gives them a moral and philosophical significance, as if each has a distinctive lesson to teach him.
As autumn turns to winter, Thoreau begins preparations for the arrival of the cold. He listens to the squirrel, the rabbit, and the fox as they scuttle about gathering food. He watches the migrating birds, and welcomes the pests that infest his cabin as they escape the coming frosts. He prepares his walls with plaster to shut out the wind. By day he makes a study of the snow and ice, giving special attention to the mystic blue ice of Walden Pond, and by night he sits and listens to the wind as it whips and whistles outside his door. Thoreau occasionally sees ice-fishermen come to cut out huge blocks that are shipped off to cities, and contemplates how most of the ice will melt and flow back to Walden Pond. Occasionally Thoreau receives a visit from a friend like William Ellery Channing or Amos Bronson Alcott, but for the most part he is alone. In one chapter, he conjures up visions of earlier residents of Walden Pond long dead and largely forgotten, including poor tradesmen and former slaves. Thoreau prefers to see himself in their company, rather than amid the cultivated and wealthy classes.
As he becomes acquainted with Walden Pond and neighboring ponds, Thoreau wants to map their layout and measure their depths. Thoreau finds that Walden Pond is no more than a hundred feet deep, thereby refuting common folk wisdom that it is bottomless. He meditates on the pond as a symbol of infinity that people need in their lives. Eventually winter gives way to spring, and with a huge crash and roar the ice of Walden Pond begins to melt and hit the shore. In lyric imagery echoing the onset of Judgment Day, Thoreau describes the coming of spring as a vast transformation of the face of the world, a time when all sins are forgiven.
Thoreau announces that his project at the pond is over, and that he returned to civilized life on September 6, 1847. The revitalization of the landscape suggests the restoration of the full powers of the human soul, and Thoreau’s narrative observations give way, in the last chapter of Walden, to a more direct sermonizing about the untapped potential within humanity. In visionary language, Thoreau exhorts us to “meet” our lives and live fully."
Treading,"In the Puritan New England town of Salem, Massachusetts, a group of girls goes dancing in the forest with a black slave named Tituba. While dancing, they are caught by the local minister, Reverend Parris. One of the girls, Parris’s daughter Betty, falls into a coma-like state. A crowd gathers in the Parris home while rumors of witchcraft fill the town. Having sent for Reverend Hale, an expert on witchcraft, Parris questions Abigail Williams, the girls’ ringleader, about the events that took place in the forest. Abigail, who is Parris’s niece and ward, admits to doing nothing beyond “dancing.”
While Parris tries to calm the crowd that has gathered in his home, Abigail talks to some of the other girls, telling them not to admit to anything. John Proctor, a local farmer, then enters and talks to Abigail alone. Unbeknownst to anyone else in the town, while working in Proctor’s home the previous year she engaged in an affair with him, which led to her being fired by his wife, Elizabeth. Abigail still desires Proctor, but he fends her off and tells her to end her foolishness with the girls.
Betty wakes up and begins screaming. Much of the crowd rushes upstairs and gathers in her bedroom, arguing over whether she is bewitched. A separate argument between Proctor, Parris, the argumentative Giles Corey, and the wealthy Thomas Putnam soon ensues. This dispute centers on money and land deeds, and it suggests that deep fault lines run through the Salem community. As the men argue, Reverend Hale arrives and examines Betty, while Proctor departs. Hale quizzes Abigail about the girls’ activities in the forest, grows suspicious of her behavior, and demands to speak to Tituba. After Parris and Hale interrogate her for a brief time, Tituba confesses to communing with the devil, and she hysterically accuses various townsfolk of consorting with the devil. Suddenly, Abigail joins her, confessing to having seen the devil conspiring and cavorting with other townspeople. Betty joins them in naming witches, and the crowd is thrown into an uproar.
A week later, alone in their farmhouse outside of town, John and Elizabeth Proctor discuss the ongoing trials and the escalating number of townsfolk who have been accused of being witches. Elizabeth urges her husband to denounce Abigail as a fraud; he refuses, and she becomes jealous, accusing him of still harboring feelings for her. Mary Warren, their servant and one of Abigail’s circle, returns from Salem with news that Elizabeth has been accused of witchcraft but the court did not pursue the accusation. Mary is sent up to bed, and John and Elizabeth continue their argument, only to be interrupted by a visit from Reverend Hale. While they discuss matters, Giles Corey and Francis Nurse come to the Proctor home with news that their wives have been arrested. Officers of the court suddenly arrive and arrest Elizabeth. After they have taken her, Proctor browbeats Mary, insisting that she must go to Salem and expose Abigail and the other girls as frauds.
The next day, Proctor brings Mary to court and tells Judge Danforth that she will testify that the girls are lying. Danforth is suspicious of Proctor’s motives and tells Proctor, truthfully, that Elizabeth is pregnant and will be spared for a time. Proctor persists in his charge, convincing Danforth to allow Mary to testify. Mary tells the court that the girls are lying. When the girls are brought in, they turn the tables by accusing Mary of bewitching them. Furious, Proctor confesses his affair with Abigail and accuses her of being motivated by jealousy of his wife. To test Proctor’s claim, Danforth summons Elizabeth and asks her if Proctor has been unfaithful to her. Despite her natural honesty, she lies to protect Proctor’s honor, and Danforth denounces Proctor as a liar. Meanwhile, Abigail and the girls again pretend that Mary is bewitching them, and Mary breaks down and accuses Proctor of being a witch. Proctor rages against her and against the court. He is arrested, and Hale quits the proceedings.
The summer passes and autumn arrives. The witch trials have caused unrest in neighboring towns, and Danforth grows nervous. Abigail has run away, taking all of Parris’s money with her. Hale, who has lost faith in the court, begs the accused witches to confess falsely in order to save their lives, but they refuse. Danforth, however, has an idea: he asks Elizabeth to talk John into confessing, and she agrees. Conflicted, but desiring to live, John agrees to confess, and the officers of the court rejoice. But he refuses to incriminate anyone else, and when the court insists that the confession must be made public, Proctor grows angry, tears it up, and retracts his admission of guilt. Despite Hale’s desperate pleas, Proctor goes to the gallows with the others, and the witch trials reach their awful conclusion."
Brothers,"In his youth, Fyodor Pavlovich Karamazov is a coarse, vulgar man whose main concerns are making money and seducing young women. He marries twice and has three sons: Dmitri, the child of his first wife, and Ivan and Alyosha, children of his second wife. Fyodor Pavlovich never has any interest in his sons, and when their mothers die, he sends them away to be brought up by relatives and friends. At the beginning of the novel, Dmitri Karamazov, who is now a twenty-eight-year-old soldier, has just returned to Fyodor Pavlovich’s town. Fyodor Pavlovich is unhappy to see Dmitri because Dmitri has come to claim an inheritance left to him by his mother. Fyodor Pavlovich plans to keep the inheritance for himself. The two men swiftly fall into conflict over the money, and the coldly intellectual Ivan, who knows neither his father nor his brother well, is eventually called in to help settle their dispute. The kind, faithful Alyosha, who is about twenty, also lives in the town, where he is an acolyte, or apprentice, at the monastery, studying with the renowned elder Zosima. Eventually Dmitri and Fyodor Pavlovich agree that perhaps Zosima could help resolve the Karamazovs’ quarrel, and Alyosha tentatively consents to arrange a meeting.
	At the monastery, Alyosha’s worst fears are realized. After Fyodor Pavlovich makes a fool of himself by mocking the monks and telling vulgar stories, Dmitri arrives late, and Dmitri and Fyodor Pavlovich become embroiled in a shouting match. It turns out that they have more to quarrel about than money: they are both in love with Grushenka, a beautiful young woman in the town. Dmitri has left his fiancée, Katerina, to pursue Grushenka, while Fyodor Pavlovich has promised to give Grushenka 3,000 rubles if she becomes his lover. This sum is significant, as Dmitri recently stole 3,000 rubles from Katerina in order to finance a lavish trip with Grushenka, and he is now desperate to pay the money back. As father and son shout at each other at the monastery, the wise old Zosima unexpectedly kneels and bows his head to the ground at Dmitri’s feet. He later explains to Alyosha that he could see that Dmitri is destined to suffer greatly.
	Many years previously, Fyodor Pavlovich Karamazov fathered a fourth son with a retarded mute girl who lived in town as the village idiot. The girl died as she gave birth to the baby, who was taken in by servants of Fyodor Pavlovich and forced to work as a servant for him as well. Fyodor Pavlovich never treats the child, Smerdyakov, as a son, and Smerdyakov develops a strange and malicious personality. He also suffers from epilepsy. Despite the limitations of his upbringing, however, Smerdyakov is not stupid. He enjoys nothing more than listening to Ivan discuss philosophy, and in his own conversations, he frequently invokes many of Ivan’s ideas—specifically that the soul is not immortal, and that therefore morality does not exist and the categories of good and evil are irrelevant to human experience.
	After the humiliating scene in the monastery, the rest of Alyosha’s day is only slightly less trying. Dmitri sends Alyosha to break off Dmitri’s engagement with Katerina. Alyosha then argues about religion with Ivan in front of the smirking Fyodor Pavlovich. Alyosha also gets caught in the middle of another explosion between Dmitri and Fyodor Pavlovich over Grushenka, in the course of which Dmitri throws Fyodor Pavlovich to the ground and threatens to kill him. But despite the hardships of his day, Alyosha is so gentle and loving that he is concerned only with how he might help his family. After tending his father’s wounds, he returns to the monastery for the night.
	The next day, Alyosha visits Katerina. To his surprise, Ivan is with Katerina, and Alyosha immediately perceives that Ivan and Katerina are in love. Alyosha tries to convince them that they should act on their love for one another, but they are both too proud and cold to listen. Alyosha has dinner with Ivan, and Ivan explains to him the source of his religious doubt: he cannot reconcile the idea of a loving God with the needless suffering of innocent people, particularly children. Any God that would allow such suffering, he says, does not love mankind. He recites a poem he has written called “The Grand Inquisitor,” in which he accuses Christ of placing an intolerable burden upon humanity by guaranteeing that people have free will and the ability to choose whether or not to believe in God.
	That evening, Alyosha again returns to the monastery, where the frail Zosima is now on his deathbed. Alyosha hurries to Zosima’s cell, and arrives just in time to hear his final lesson, which emphasizes the importance of love and forgiveness in all human affairs. Zosima dies stretching his arms out before him, as though to embrace the world.
	Many of the monks are optimistic that Zosima’s death will be accompanied by a miracle, but no miracle takes place. If anything, Zosima’s corpse begins to stink more quickly than might have been expected, which is taken by Zosima’s critics to mean that he was corrupt and unreliable in life. Sickened by the injustice of seeing the wise and loving Zosima humiliated after his death, Alyosha allows his friend Rakitin to take him to see Grushenka. Although Rakitin and Grushenka hope to corrupt Alyosha, just the opposite happens, and a bond of sympathy and understanding springs up between Grushenka and Alyosha. Their friendship renews Alyosha’s faith, and Alyosha helps Grushenka to begin her own spiritual redemption. That night, Alyosha has a dream in which Zosima tells him that he has done a good deed in helping Grushenka. This dream further strengthens Alyosha’s love and resolve, and he goes outside to kiss the ground to show his passion for doing good on Earth.
	Dmitri has spent two days unsuccessfully trying to raise the money to pay Katerina the 3,000 rubles he owes her. No one will lend him the money, and he has nothing to sell. At last he goes to Grushenka’s house, and when she is not there, he is suddenly convinced that she has gone to be with Fyodor Pavlovich. He rushes to Fyodor Pavlovich’s house, but finds that Grushenka is not there. While prowling on the grounds, Dmitri strikes Fyodor Pavlovich’s old servant, Grigory, leaving him bloody and unconscious. Then he flees. He returns to Grushenka’s house, and learns from her maid that Grushenka has gone to rejoin a lover who abandoned her several years ago. Dmitri now decides that his only course of action is to kill himself. But he decides to see Grushenka one last time before he does so.
	A few minutes later, Dmitri strides into a shop, with his shirt bloody and a large wad of cash in his hand. He buys food and wine, and travels out to see Grushenka and her lover. When Grushenka sees the two men together, she realizes that she really loves Dmitri. Dmitri locks the other man in a closet, and Dmitri and Grushenka begin to plan their wedding. But the police suddenly burst in and arrest Dmitri. He is accused of the murder of his father, who has been found dead. Due to the large amount of evidence against Dmitri, including the money suddenly found in his possession, he will be made to stand trial. Dmitri says that the money was what he had left after spending half of the 3,000 rubles he stole from Katerina, but no one believes him. Dmitri is imprisoned.
	Meanwhile, Alyosha befriends some of the local schoolboys. He meets a dying boy named Ilyusha, and arranges for the other boys to come visit him every day. Alyosha helps Ilyusha’s family as the young boy nears death, and he is universally adored by all the schoolboys, who look to him for guidance.
	Ivan talks to Smerdyakov about Fyodor Pavlovich’s death, and Smerdyakov confesses to Ivan that he, and not Dmitri, committed the murder. But he says that Ivan is also implicated in the crime because the philosophical lessons Smerdyakov learned from Ivan, regarding the impossibility of evil in a world without a God, made Smerdyakov capable of committing murder. This statement causes Ivan to become consumed with guilt. After returning home, Ivan suffers a nervous breakdown in which he sees a devil that relentlessly taunts him. The apparition vanishes when Alyosha arrives with the news that Smerdyakov has hung himself.
	At the trial, Dmitri’s case seems to be going well until Ivan is called upon to testify. Ivan madly asserts that he himself is guilty of the murder, throwing the courtroom into confusion. To clear Ivan’s name, Katerina leaps up and shows a letter she received from Dmitri in which he wrote that he was afraid he might one day murder his father. Even after the letter is read, most of the people in the courtroom are convinced of Dmitri’s innocence. But the peasants on the jury find him guilty, and he is taken back to prison to await his exile in Siberia.
	After the trial, Katerina takes Ivan to her house, where she plans to nurse him through his illness. She and Dmitri forgive one another, and she arranges for Dmitri to escape from prison and flee to America with Grushenka. Alyosha’s friend Ilyusha dies, and Alyosha gives a speech to the schoolboys at his funeral. In plain language, he says that they must all remember the love they feel for one another and treasure their memories of one another. The schoolboys, moved, give Alyosha an enthusiastic cheer."
Domain,"The novel’s protagonist and narrator, Salim, grew up in a community of ethnically Indian Muslims on the east African coast. As the novel opens, Salim explains how he came to leave his coastal home and move to an unnamed country in the African interior. Worried that the trend of political independence sweeping the continent would scatter his home community, Salim sought a way out. When a family friend named Nazruddin returned to the coast after several years in the interior, he offered to sell Salim his trading goods shop. Salim took Nazruddin up on his offer and drove to his new home: a former colonial town located at the bend in a major river.
Salim found the town decrepit and scattered with vestiges of empire that local Africans had destroyed in retaliation against their longstanding colonial oppressor. Only a few Europeans remained, and most Africans had returned to their villages in the bush. Not long after Salim’s arrival in the interior, an uprising devastated the Indian community on the coast. News of the persecutions vindicated Salim’s decision to relocate. In the midst of the uprising, Salim’s family sent a half-African former slave named Metty to serve as Salim’s shop assistant.
Salim’s modest shop traded in basic household goods, and his first customer was an African trader named Zabeth, locally renowned as a sorceress. Zabeth wanted her son, Ferdinand, to get a formal education, so she sent him to attend the secondary school in the town and asked Salim to watch over him. A Belgian priest named Father Huismans ran the school. Though Huismans believed in European superiority, African religions fascinated him, and he maintained a collection of wooden masks.
Just as life in the town began to pick up, rebel activity ignited in the bush. The President sent white mercenaries, and they swiftly quashed the rebellion. As peace set in again, Huismans was murdered while on an expedition in the bush. Soon after the murder, which nobody investigated, an American traveler stole the majority of Huismans’s mask collection.
Following the rebellion, the town experienced an economic boom, and it once again became a regional trading center. In the midst of the boom, the President commandeered a section of land near the town that had once been a European suburb but had since reverted to bush. On the large plot, now deemed a “Domain of the State,” the President commissioned the construction of modern-looking buildings that would comprise a new polytechnic university. The people in the town, however, remained largely ignorant of what went on in the Domain, which seemed to them a world apart.
Lecturers and professors came from the capital and from abroad, including a childhood friend of Salim’s named Indar. Indar introduced Salim to the society of the Domain, which was full of European intellectuals and African students discussing “the new Africa.” Though stimulated by his experiences in the Domain, Salim felt conflicted about the place. The lofty discussions of African modernity clashed with the evidently shoddy construction of the buildings and an aborted farm project, already overgrown with unused tractors rusting in the field.
Among the people Salim met in the Domain were a historian named Raymond and his much younger wife, Yvette. Raymond was once the President’s mentor, and he remained loyal to the President despite falling out of the politician’s favor. Though Raymond’s progress on a monumental history of the country had stalled, he worked on editing a collection of the President’s speeches. But the President, evidently displeased with Raymond’s work, published and distributed a radically altered version of the book that only included brief maxims.
Meanwhile, Salim engaged in an affair with Yvette. For Salim, who had only previously slept with prostitutes, his intensely physical liaisons with Yvette proved reinvigorating. But as their relationship progressed, Salim grew uncomfortable with his connection to Yvette and the failures of her husband. Sensing that Yvette saw him as another version of Raymond, Salim attacked her. Their affair fizzled out.
When a prominent business owner suddenly sold off his assets and left town, Salim and others understood the event as marking the end of the town’s boom. Soon after, political unrest began to grow. The President established a Youth Guard to help maintain order, but he disbanded the group when members started abusing their power. Presumably humiliated by the President’s denunciation, former Youth Guard members formed a Liberation Army, which publicly proclaimed its rejection of the President and his vision of a new Africa.
Increasing violence perpetrated by the Liberation Army led Salim to seek a way out of the country. He decided to travel to London to visit Nazruddin. During his visit, Salim learned about Nazruddin’s disastrous business ventures in Canada and his troubles in London. Salim also felt disenchanted to see so many people “like him” struggling to survive. The experience made him realize the need to reject false ideals about home and security and instead live in the world as it was. Before he left London, Salim got engaged to Nazruddin’s daughter, Kareisha.
Upon returning to the town at the bend in the river, Salim learned that the President had ordered the nationalization of all foreign-owned businesses. An inexperienced and increasingly troublesome African named Théotime now owned the shop and kept Salim on as manager and chauffeur. Desperate to get out of the country for good, Salim started trading illegally in gold and ivory. On a tip from Metty, the police discovered Salim’s hidden cache of prohibited goods, and when Salim refused to pay a bribe, they arrested him.
After days in jail, the arresting officer escorted Salim to see the commissioner, who happened to be Zabeth’s son, Ferdinand. Ferdinand informed Salim that the political situation was deteriorating and counseled him to leave town as soon as possible. The next day, on the eve of the President’s arrival in the town, Salim boarded the steamer and left."
Indivisible,"The narrator begins telling his story with the claim that he is an “invisible man.” His invisibility, he says, is not a physical condition—he is not literally invisible—but is rather the result of the refusal of others to see him. He says that because of his invisibility, he has been hiding from the world, living underground and stealing electricity from the Monopolated Light & Power Company. He burns 1,369 light bulbs simultaneously and listens to Louis Armstrong’s “(What Did I Do to Be So) Black and Blue” on a phonograph. He says that he has gone underground in order to write the story of his life and invisibility.
As a young man, in the late 1920s or early 1930s, the narrator lived in the South. Because he is a gifted public speaker, he is invited to give a speech to a group of important white men in his town. The men reward him with a briefcase containing a scholarship to a prestigious Black college, but only after humiliating him by forcing him to fight in a “battle royal” in which he is pitted against other young Black men, all blindfolded, in a boxing ring. After the battle royal, the white men force the youths to scramble over an electrified rug in order to snatch at fake gold coins. The narrator has a dream that night in which he imagines that his scholarship is actually a piece of paper with a crude command to keep him running.
Three years later, the narrator is a student at the college. He is asked to drive a wealthy white trustee of the college, Mr. Norton, around the campus. Norton talks incessantly about his daughter, then shows an undue interest in the narrative of Jim Trueblood, a poor, uneducated Black man who impregnated his own daughter. After hearing this story, Norton needs a drink, and the narrator takes him to the Golden Day, a saloon and brothel that normally serves Black men. A fight breaks out among a group of Black veterans at the bar, and Norton passes out during the chaos. He is tended by one of the veterans, who claims to be a doctor and who taunts both Norton and the narrator for their blindness regarding race relations.
Back at the college, the narrator listens to a long, impassioned sermon by the Reverend Homer A. Barbee on the subject of the college’s Founder, whom the blind Barbee glorifies with poetic language. After the sermon, the narrator is chastised by the college president, Dr. Bledsoe, who has learned of the narrator’s misadventures with Norton at the old slave quarters and the Golden Day. Bledsoe rebukes the narrator, saying that he should have shown the white man an idealized version of Black life. He expels the narrator, giving him seven letters of recommendation addressed to the college’s white trustees in New York City, and sends him there in search of a job.
The narrator travels to the bright lights and bustle of 1930s Harlem, where he looks unsuccessfully for work. The letters of recommendation are of no help. At last, the narrator goes to the office of one of his letters’ addressees, a trustee named Mr. Emerson. There he meets Emerson’s son, who opens the letter and tells the narrator that he has been betrayed: the letters from Bledsoe actually portray the narrator as dishonorable and unreliable. The young Emerson helps the narrator to get a low-paying job at the Liberty Paints plant, whose trademark color is “Optic White.” The narrator briefly serves as an assistant to Lucius Brockway, the Black man who makes this white paint, but Brockway suspects him of joining in union activities and turns on him. The two men fight, neglecting the paint-making; consequently, one of the unattended tanks explodes, and the narrator is knocked unconscious.
The narrator wakes in the paint factory’s hospital, having temporarily lost his memory and ability to speak. The white doctors seize the arrival of their unidentified black patient as an opportunity to conduct electric shock experiments. After the narrator recovers his memory and leaves the hospital, he collapses on the street. Some black community members take him to the home of Mary, a kind woman who lets him live with her for free in Harlem and nurtures his sense of Black heritage. One day, the narrator witnesses the eviction of an elderly Black couple from their Harlem apartment. Standing before the crowd of people gathered before the apartment, he gives an impassioned speech against the eviction. Brother Jack overhears his speech and offers him a position as a spokesman for the Brotherhood, a political organization that allegedly works to help the socially oppressed. After initially rejecting the offer, the narrator takes the job in order to pay Mary back for her hospitality. But the Brotherhood demands that the narrator take a new name, break with his past, and move to a new apartment. The narrator is inducted into the Brotherhood at a party at the Chthonian Hotel and is placed in charge of advancing the group’s goals in Harlem.
After being trained in rhetoric by a white member of the group named Brother Hambro, the narrator goes to his assigned branch in Harlem, where he meets the handsome, intelligent black youth leader Tod Clifton. He also becomes familiar with the Black nationalist leader Ras the Exhorter, who opposes the interracial Brotherhood and believes that Black Americans should fight for their rights over and against all whites. The narrator delivers speeches and becomes a high-profile figure in the Brotherhood, and he enjoys his work. One day, however, he receives an anonymous note warning him to remember his place as a Black man in the Brotherhood. Not long after, the Black Brotherhood member Brother Wrestrum accuses the narrator of trying to use the Brotherhood to advance a selfish desire for personal distinction. While a committee of the Brotherhood investigates the charges, the organization moves the narrator to another post, as an advocate of women’s rights. After giving a speech one evening, he is seduced by one of the white women at the gathering, who attempts to use him to play out her sexual fantasies about Black men.
After a short time, the Brotherhood sends the narrator back to Harlem, where he discovers that Clifton has disappeared. Many other Black members have left the group, as much of the Harlem community feels that the Brotherhood has betrayed their interests. The narrator finds Clifton on the street selling dancing “Sambo” dolls—dolls that invoke the stereotype of the lazy and obsequious slave. Clifton apparently does not have a permit to sell his wares on the street. White policemen accost him and, after a scuffle, shoot him dead as the narrator and others look on. On his own initiative, the narrator holds a funeral for Clifton and gives a speech in which he portrays his dead friend as a hero, galvanizing public sentiment in Clifton’s favor. The Brotherhood is furious with him for staging the funeral without permission, and Jack harshly castigates him. As Jack rants about the Brotherhood’s ideological stance, a glass eye falls from one of his eye sockets. The Brotherhood sends the narrator back to Brother Hambro to learn about the organization’s new strategies in Harlem.
The narrator leaves feeling furious and anxious to gain revenge on Jack and the Brotherhood. He arrives in Harlem to find the neighborhood in ever-increased agitation over race relations. Ras confronts him, deploring the Brotherhood’s failure to draw on the momentum generated by Clifton’s funeral. Ras sends his men to beat up the narrator, and the narrator is forced to disguise himself in dark glasses and a hat. In his dark glasses, many people on the streets mistake him for someone named Rinehart, who seems to be a pimp, bookie, lover, and reverend all at once. At last, the narrator goes to Brother Hambro’s apartment, where Hambro tells him that the Brotherhood has chosen not to emphasize Harlem and the Black movement. He cynically declares that people are merely tools and that the larger interests of the Brotherhood are more important than any individual. Recalling advice given to him by his grandfather, the narrator determines to undermine the Brotherhood by seeming to go along with them completely. He decides to flatter and seduce a woman close to one of the party leaders in order to obtain secret information about the group.
But the woman he chooses, Sybil, knows nothing about the Brotherhood and attempts to use the narrator to fulfill her fantasy of being raped by a Black man. While still with Sybil in his apartment, the narrator receives a call asking him to come to Harlem quickly. The narrator hears the sound of breaking glass, and the line goes dead. He arrives in Harlem to find the neighborhood in the midst of a full-fledged riot, which he learns was incited by Ras. The narrator becomes involved in setting fire to a tenement building. Running from the scene of the crime, he encounters Ras, dressed as an African chieftain. Ras calls for the narrator to be lynched. The narrator flees, only to encounter two policemen, who suspect that his briefcase contains loot from the riots. In his attempt to evade them, the narrator falls down a manhole. The police mock him and draw the cover over the manhole.
The narrator says that he has stayed underground ever since; the end of his story is also the beginning. He states that he finally has realized that he must honor his individual complexity and remain true to his own identity without sacrificing his responsibility to the community. He says that he finally feels ready to emerge from underground."
Registered,"The convict Jean Valjean is released from a French prison after serving nineteen years for stealing a loaf of bread and for subsequent attempts to escape from prison. When Valjean arrives at the town of Digne, no one is willing to give him shelter because he is an ex-convict. Desperate, Valjean knocks on the door of M. Myriel, the kindly bishop of Digne. Myriel treats Valjean with kindness, and Valjean repays the bishop by stealing his silverware. When the police arrest Valjean, Myriel covers for him, claiming that the silverware was a gift. The authorities release Valjean and Myriel makes him promise to become an honest man. Eager to fulfill his promise, Valjean masks his identity and enters the town of Montreuil-sur-mer. Under the assumed name of Madeleine, Valjean invents an ingenious manufacturing process that brings the town prosperity. He eventually becomes the town’s mayor.
Fantine, a young woman from Montreuil, lives in Paris. She falls in love with Tholomyès, a wealthy student who gets her pregnant and then abandons her. Fantine returns to her home village with her daughter, Cosette. On the way to Montreuil, however, Fantine realizes that she will never be able to find work if the townspeople know that she has an illegitimate child. In the town of Montfermeil, she meets the Thénardiers, a family that runs the local inn. The Thénardiers agree to look after Cosette as long as Fantine sends them a monthly allowance.
In Montreuil, Fantine finds work in Madeleine’s factory. Fantine’s coworkers find out about Cosette, however, and Fantine is fired. The Thénardiers demand more money to support Cosette, and Fantine resorts to prostitution to make ends meet. One night, Javert, Montreuil’s police chief, arrests Fantine. She is to be sent to prison, but Madeleine intervenes. Fantine has fallen ill, and when she longs to see Cosette, Madeleine promises to send for her. First, however, he must contend with Javert, who has discovered Madeleine’s criminal past. Javert tells Madeleine that a man has been accused of being Jean Valjean, and Madeleine confesses his true identity. Javert shows up to arrest Valjean while Valjean is at Fantine’s bedside, and Fantine dies from the shock.
After a few years, Valjean escapes from prison and heads to Montfermeil, where he is able to buy Cosette from the Thénardiers. The Thénardiers turn out to be a family of scoundrels who abuse Cosette while spoiling their own two daughters, Eponine and Azelma. Valjean and Cosette move to a run-down part of Paris. Javert discovers their hideout, however, and they are forced to flee. They find refuge in a convent, where Cosette attends school and Valjean works as a gardener.
Marius Pontmercy is a young man who lives with his wealthy grandfather, M. Gillenormand. Because of political differences within the family, Marius has never met his father, Georges Pontmercy. After his father dies, however, Marius learns more about him and comes to admire his father’s democratic politics. Angry with his grandfather, Marius moves out of Gillenormand’s house and lives as a poor young law student. While in law school, Marius associates with a group of radical students, the Friends of the ABC, who are led by the charismatic Enjolras. One day, Marius sees Cosette at a public park. It is love at first sight, but the protective Valjean does his utmost to prevent Cosette and Marius from ever meeting. Their paths cross once again, however, when Valjean makes a charitable visit to Marius’s poor neighbors, the Jondrettes. The Jondrettes are in fact the Thénardiers, who have lost their inn and moved to Paris under an assumed name. After Valjean leaves, Thénardier announces a plan to rob Valjean when he returns. Alarmed, Marius alerts the local police inspector, who turns out to be Javert. The ambush is foiled and the Thénardiers are arrested, but Valjean escapes before Javert can identify him.
Thénardier’s daughter Eponine, who is in love with Marius, helps Marius discover Cosette’s whereabouts. Marius is finally able to make contact with Cosette, and the two declare their love for each other. Valjean, however, soon shatters their happiness. Worried that he will lose Cosette and unnerved by political unrest in the city, Valjean announces that he and Cosette are moving to England. In desperation, Marius runs to his grandfather, M. Gillenormand, to ask for M. Gillenormand’s permission to marry Cosette. Their meeting ends in a bitter argument. When Marius returns to Cosette, she and Valjean have disappeared. Heartbroken, Marius decides to join his radical student friends, who have started a political uprising. Armed with two pistols, Marius heads for the barricades.
The uprising seems doomed, but Marius and his fellow students nonetheless stand their ground and vow to fight for freedom and democracy. The students discover Javert among their ranks, and, realizing that he is a spy, Enjolras ties him up. As the army launches its first attack against the students, Eponine throws herself in front of a rifle to save Marius’s life. As Eponine dies in Marius’s arms, she hands him a letter from Cosette. Marius quickly scribbles a reply and orders a boy, Gavroche, to deliver it to Cosette.
Valjean manages to intercept the note and sets out to save the life of the man his daughter loves. Valjean arrives at the barricade and volunteers to execute Javert. When alone with Javert, however, Valjean instead secretly lets him go free. As the army storms the barricade, Valjean grabs the wounded Marius and flees through the sewers. When Valjean emerges hours later, Javert immediately arrests him. Valjean pleads with Javert to let him take the dying Marius to Marius’s grandfather. Javert agrees. Javert feels tormented, torn between his duty to his profession and the debt he owes Valjean for saving his life. Ultimately, Javert lets Valjean go and throws himself into the river, where he drowns.
Marius makes a full recovery and is reconciled with Gillenormand, who consents to Marius and Cosette’s marriage. Their wedding is a happy one, marred only when Valjean confesses his criminal past to Marius. Alarmed by this revelation and unaware that it was Valjean who saved his life at the barricades, Marius tries to prevent Cosette from having contact with Valjean. Lonely and depressed, Valjean takes to his bed and awaits his death. Marius eventually finds out from Thénardier that Valjean saved Marius’s life. Ashamed that he mistrusted Valjean, Marius tells Cosette everything that has happened. Marius and Cosette rush to Valjean’s side just in time for a final reconciliation. Happy to be reunited with his adopted daughter, Valjean dies in peace."
Order,"Harry Potter is spending another tedious summer with his dreadful Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon when a group of evil spirits called “dementors” stage an unexpected attack on Harry and his cousin Dudley. After using magic to defend himself, Harry is visited by a group of wizards and whisked off to number twelve, Grimmauld Place, London. Number twelve is the home of Harry’s godfather, Sirius Black, and the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix. The Order is a group of wizards, led by Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore, dedicated to fighting evil Lord Voldemort and his followers. The Order is forced to operate in secrecy, outside of the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Magic, which is headed by the dense and corrupt Cornelius Fudge. Fudge refuses to believe that Lord Voldemort has returned.
Harry used magic to fight off the dementors, and since underage wizards are not permitted to use their wands outside of school, he must face a disciplinary hearing at the Ministry. With Dumbledore’s help, Harry is cleared and permitted to return to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. 
Reunited with his best friends, Ron and Hermione, Harry returns to Hogwarts and learns that Dolores Umbridge, an employee of Fudge, will be his new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. The Sorting Hat, which traditionally sorts all new students into one of four houses, cautions the students against becoming too internally divided. Meanwhile, the wizard newspaper, the Daily Prophet, continues printing untrue and unfair stories about Harry. Many of his classmates are whispering about him behind his back, but Harry ignores them and tries to concentrate on his studies, since all fifth-year students at Hogwarts are required to take O.W.L.s, or Ordinary Wizarding Level examinations. 
Umbridge refuses to teach her students how to perform Defense spells, and before long, Fudge appoints her High Inquisitor of Hogwarts, giving her the authority to inspect all faculty members and evaluate their skills. In desperation, Harry, Hermione, and Ron form their own Defense Against the Dark Arts group, also known as the D.A., or Dumbledore’s Army. Twenty-five other students sign up, and they meet as often as possible to learn and practice Defense spells. Harry wishes desperately to contact his godfather Sirius to discuss the situation, but Umbridge is inspecting all Owl Mail and patrolling the fires that students can use to make contact with wizards residing outside of Hogwarts. Umbridge openly dislikes Harry, whom she considers a liar, and eventually bans him from the Gryffindor Quidditch team. Ron’s twin brothers, Fred and George, storm out of Hogwarts in protest, moving to London where they plan to open a joke shop using the money Harry won last year in the Triwizard Tournament.
Harry continues to have upsetting dreams about walking down a corridor at the Department of Mysteries, deep inside the Ministry of Magic. At the end of the corridor, Harry goes through several doors and enters a room full of dusty glass spheres. Harry always wakes up before he finds out what the dream means or what the spheres signify. One night, Harry has a vision where he inhabits the body of a large snake, and attacks Ron’s father. Harry wakes up horrified, and Professor McGonagall takes him to Dumbledore immediately. Dumbledore uses the portraits on the walls of his office to raise an alert, and Mr. Weasley is promptly rescued by two members of the Order. Dumbledore then demands that Harry take Occlumency lessons with Professor Snape, which should help Harry protect his mind against further invasions by Lord Voldemort. 
Harry is unsuccessful at Occlumency because he has such difficulty clearing his mind of all thoughts, making it difficult for him to focus on closing his mind off to all outside influence. Meanwhile, his scar (from the attack in which Voldemort killed Harry’s parents) burns horribly every time Voldemort experiences a powerful emotion. The D.A. continues to meet regularly, and Harry’s peers show great improvement until they are caught by Umbridge. Dumbledore takes full responsibility for the group and resigns as Headmaster. Umbridge takes over his position. The students begin taking their O.W.L. exams, and Harry has another vision, this time about Sirius being held captive and tortured by Voldemort. Horrified, Harry becomes determined to save him. Hermione warns Harry that Voldemort may be deliberately trying to lure Harry to the Department of Mysteries, but Harry is too concerned about Sirius to take any chances. 
Harry sneaks into Umbridge’s office, and, using her fireplace, transports himself to Twelve Grimmauld Place to look for Sirius. Kreacher, the Black house elf, tells Harry that Sirius is at the Ministry of Magic. Harry returns to Hogwarts to find that he and his friends have been caught in Umbridge’s office. Hermione and Harry convince Umbridge to follow them into the forest, where they claim to be hiding a weapon for Dumbledore. Once in the forest, Centaurs carry Umbridge away. Harry and his friends climb aboard flying horses called thestrals and speed off to the Ministry. Once they arrive, Harry cannot find Sirius and realizes that Hermione was right. Harry also sees that one of the glass spheres has his name on it, as well as Voldemort’s. Harry grabs the sphere, and Death Eaters surround to attack, demanding that Harry hand over the prophecy. Employing all of their Defense skills, Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Luna, and Neville have moderate success fighting the Death Eaters, but they are ultimately helped enormously by the arrival of several members of the Order. In the midst of the fight, Harry drops the glass sphere, and it shatters. Meanwhile, Sirius’ own cousin, Death Eater Bellatrix Lestrange, kills Sirius. Harry is devastated.
Dumbledore appears and corrals the Death Eaters. Voldemort and Lestrange escape, just as Fudge shows up. Dumbledore sends Harry back to school, where he explains how the sphere was a prophecy, which stated that Harry has a power that Voldemort does not know about. Dumbledore explains that this power is love. The prophecy goes on to claim that Harry will either destroy Voldemort or be destroyed by him. Dumbledore takes this opportunity to tell Harry why he must spend his summers with the Durselys in Little Whinging. Because Harry’s mother died to save him, he is blessed with her love, a blessing that can be sealed only by blood. Harry’s Aunt Petunia, his mother’s sister, makes that bond complete by taking Harry into her home. As long as he still calls Little Whinging home, Harry is safe. With this news, Harry returns to his Aunt and Uncle’s house for one more miserable summer."
Murder,"The first-person narrator of the story, Dr. James Sheppard, lives with his older unmarried sister Caroline in the country village of King’s Abbot on the outskirts of London. As the local physician with an active practice, Dr. Sheppard becomes emmeshed in a mysterious suicide and murder and the ensuing investigations into them over a nine-day period.
Dr. Sheppard begins his account on the morning of September 17 with the overdose death of his patient Mrs. Ferrars, a wealthy widow whose husband had died the previous year. Dr. Sheppard had attended Mr. Ferrars’s death as well, ruling he died of acute gastritis resulting from alcoholism. Now he must determine Mrs. Ferrars’s cause of death. Caroline has an inexhaustible curiosity about everyone and a keen imagination. She tells Dr. Sheppard that she believes Mrs. Ferrars’s overdose was not accidental but suicide from the remorse for having poisoned Mr. Ferrars.
At the time of her death, Mrs. Ferrars had been seeing another of Dr. Sheppard’s patients, the wealthy widower Roger Ackroyd, and the townspeople expected them to announce plans to marry. Roger had also lost his spouse to alcoholism twenty-one years prior, leaving him to raise her son from a previous marriage, Ralph Paton, whom Roger adopted. Also living with Roger at his Fernly Park estate are his late brother’s widow, Mrs. Cecil Ackroyd, and her daughter, Flora. His main staff includes secretary Geoffrey Raymond, housekeeper Miss Russell, butler Parker, parlormaid Ursula Bourne, and housemaid Elsie Dale.
On the evening of September 17, Roger Ackroyd invites Dr. Sheppard to dinner to consult with him about a matter causing him much distress. After dinner, they retire to Roger’s study to confer privately. Roger tells Dr. Sheppard that he had been engaged to Mrs. Ferrars for three months. The day before her death, she confessed to him that she had poisoned her husband Ashley Ferrars, was being blackmailed, and would reveal the name of the blackmailer in twenty-four hours’ time. At that point, Parker delivers a blue envelope with Mrs. Ferrars’s handwriting, and Roger reads aloud to Dr. Sheppard her suicide note. But Roger abruptly stops reading aloud before Mrs. Ferrars reveals the name of the blackmailer. Dr. Sheppard records in his manuscript, which he started after the murder, that Roger asked to be left alone to absorb the contents of the letter. Dr. Sheppard returns home by 9:15. At 10:15, he receives a phone call and rushes back to Fernly Park, telling Caroline that Parker has informed him that Roger has been murdered.
When Dr. Sheppard arrives at Fernly Park, Parker denies having made the phone call and is unaware of any murder. They break down the door to Roger’s study, which has been locked from inside, to find Roger dead with a dagger in his neck. Mrs. Ferrars’s letter is missing. The police are called to the scene and find footprints leading into and out of the study through an open window. They interview everyone in the house, but no one saw anything unusual. The police can’t find Ralph, last seen earlier in the day at the Three Boars inn where he was staying. They collect a pair of Ralph’s boots to compare with the muddy footprints and find that they match.
The next day, Flora visits Caroline and Dr. Sheppard to ask for their help. Flora explains that their new neighbor is the famous detective Hercule Poirot, and she asks Dr. Sheppard to accompany her to request his involvement in the case to clear Ralph, to whom she is engaged. Although Poirot has retired from active police work, he listens to Flora’s plea. Poirot warns Flora that if he were to take the case, he would not stop until he has the whole truth, and she agrees to his terms.
Poirot immediately asks Dr. Sheppard to visit the scene of the crime with him. Dr. Sheppard presents the background information, and Poirot makes observations. Poirot identifies to Dr. Sheppard key clues: the phone call, the open window, the door locked from the inside, and an out-of-place chair. Throughout Poirot’s investigation, he uncovers truths. He points out those who stood to gain by Roger’s death. The unknown blackmailer was about to be unmasked. Ralph and Ursula were secretly married, which would be grounds for Ralph’s disinheritance. Poirot states unequivocally that everyone involved is hiding something.
Dr. Sheppard records the unfolding investigation in a personal manuscript with mounting mistrust of Poirot’s techniques. Poirot confides in Dr. Sheppard less and less. As Poirot fits together the puzzle pieces using evidence and knowledge of human behavior, a composite of the killer emerges. Poirot paints a psychological portrait of the blackmailer—a once-decent but now-weak man who can’t resist the temptation to extort a rich widow and who pushes her too far. Poirot postulates that as this man faced exposure for his crime, the man became desperate and killed the person who stood to ruin him.
Poirot concludes his investigation and assembles the family and staff, where he challenges everyone in the room that they have until the next day to come forward, at which time he will reveal the murderer to the police. Poirot’s warning, however, is only aimed at Dr. Sheppard. Poirot then privately tells Dr. Sheppard that he has identified him as Mrs. Ferrars’s blackmailer and Roger’s killer. Dr. Sheppard scoffs, and Poirot lays out the entire scenario of motive, means, and opportunity, offering Dr. Sheppard one alternative to arrest and conviction. Dr. Sheppard finishes his manuscript with the details of his crime and his confession. He then overdoses using the same poison that killed Mrs. Ferrars."
Profess,"Irene Redfield is a light-skinned Black woman who, in public places, occasionally passes for white, when she finds it convenient. Irene is a practical, determined person. She was born and raised in Chicago but now lives in Harlem with her husband, Brian, and their two boys. Brian is a successful doctor but dislikes his work. He would have preferred to move the entire family to another, less racist country long ago, but Irene has always insisted that the family belongs in New York.
One day, while back in Chicago for a visit, Irene has a chance meeting with a childhood friend, Clare. Clare is very different from Irene—self-centered, melodramatic, and reckless. Clare is even lighter-skinned than Irene, and in fact she has married a white man, John Bellew, without telling him that she is Black. They have a daughter. The Bellews live mostly in Europe but often spend time in the Unites States, depending on where John Bellew’s work in international banking takes him. Irene finds Clare strangely fascinating but does not like her company. She only reluctantly agrees to visit Clare at the Bellews’ hotel suite. Clare has invited a mutual light-skinned friend of theirs to join them. When John Bellew arrives, Irene is shocked to learn that he is a vehement racist. He openly declares that he hates Black people, not knowing that he is speaking to three of them.
Two years later, the Bellews have relocated to New York. Clare resumes contact with Irene, and Irene is not firm enough to insist that Clare leave her alone, if only to keep Clare’s secret safe. When Clare learns that Irene is planning a charity event at which upper-class Black people and white people will mingle, Clare insists on attending. Soon, she is at the Redfields’ home regularly and has become part of their social circle. In time, Irene suspects that Clare and Brian are having an affair. The Bellews are due to move back to Europe soon, but a chance downtown encounter between John Bellew and Irene, while Irene is with a darker-skinned friend, creates a crisis. If Bellew deduces that Clare, like Irene, is Black, he may divorce Clare and leave her free to pursue Brian.
The threat that Clare poses for Irene’s marriage and family life is unexpectedly removed when Bellew tracks Clare down at an all-Black party hosted by friends of the Redfields in their apartment atop a high residential building. Bellew angrily confronts Clare, but Clare smiles and acts unconcerned. When Irene angrily moves toward Clare and puts her hand on Clare’s arm, Clare tumbles out a nearby open window, to her death. The cause of her fall is unclear—whether she fainted and fell by accident, or fell deliberately. It is also possible that Irene pushed Clare, but no one accuses her."
Lawless,"Bri Jackson, the narrator of the novel, is a 16-year-old girl from Garden Heights, a predominantly Black inner-city neighborhood. Bri has her sights set on rap stardom, hoping to follow in the footsteps of her late father, the underground rap star Lawless. As the novel opens, Bri is nervously awaiting the phone call that could be her big break: an invitation to perform in the Ring, a local club where up-and-coming rappers face off in “battles.” But first, she must endure her ACT prep class at Midtown School of the Arts so she can get her confiscated phone back from her teacher. Bri’s two best friends from Garden Heights, Sonny and Malik, are in the class with her. Like many of the other students of color at Midtown Academy, they are bused in from less affluent neighborhoods. 
By the time Bri finally gets the call to battle at the Ring, both her teacher and her mother, Jay, have reminded her that school, not rap, is the key to her future. But Bri remains fixated on rap stardom as the solution to her family’s financial problems, especially after she learns that Jay, a recovering drug addict, has lost her job. Bri’s Aunt Pooh, a gang member and a drug dealer, escorts Bri to the battle at the Ring, where she squares off with Milez, another teen rapper. In the first round of the battle, Milez raps about Lawless’s murder, shocking Bri and causing her to freeze up when it is her turn to rap. But she soon recovers and outperforms Milez in the next two rounds, winning the battle decisively. By the following morning, a video of the battle is on YouTube and all Bri’s classmates are praising her for her skills.  
Bri’s celebration is short-lived, however. Tate and Long, two school security guards who have a reputation for targeting Black and Latinx students, single Bri out to have her bag searched. When Bri objects, they violently throw her to the ground and cuff her. Bri is suspended for having candy—which her principal refers to as ""contraband—in her backpack. The security guards are suspended too, pending an investigation, but rumors circulate around the school that Bri is a drug dealer.   
Angry about the assault and people’s racist assumptions about her, Bri writes and records a defiant song called “On the Come Up.” In the song, Bri rails against racist police and other authority figures. She also boasts about having a gun and being ready to use it—because that’s what people expect anyway—even though she barely knows anything about guns. Bri shares the recording with Supreme, her father’s old manager, who promises to make her famous. Supreme releases “On the Come Up” online, where it gets picked up by a Black gossip blog and goes viral. Many of Bri’s friends love the song, but Aunt Pooh, Malik, and Trey all chastise Bri for misrepresenting herself and rapping about gang violence that she has never taken part in.  
Real violence breaks out when Tate and Long are reinstated as the school security guards. Students of color protest outside the school while chanting some of the violent lyrics from “On the Come Up.” When Tate and Long warn them to stop, some students attack the security guards, and a riot ensues. A local news station reports that Bri’s song incited the violence. Jay sees the newscast, learns about Bri’s song for the first time, and insists that Bri stop rapping, lay low, and focus on school. Instead, Bri takes to Instagram and is interviewed by a local radio show, defiantly claiming on both platforms that she won’t be silenced. During the radio interview, Bri has to be restrained after DJ Hype insults her with sexist taunts. Bri begins to feel as though she’s becoming the violent person that others assume she is.  
Meanwhile, Bri’s family continues to struggle, falling behind on bills and rent. The electric company shuts off the power and the landlord threatens eviction. Jay quits school, setting aside her dreams so she can become eligible for food stamps. To make matters worse, the Crowns, a rival gang, rob Bri and Malik at gunpoint, taking her father’s gold chain. Aunt Pooh vows to get revenge on the Crowns and disappears for ten days. When she returns, Aunt Pooh is arrested in a drug bust and taken to jail while Bri looks on.  
With her family’s struggles in mind, Bri goes to a recording studio again, this time with Supreme. Supreme encourages Bri to embrace the persona of a “hoodlum” in her music because that is what people expect of Black rappers. He has another rapper write a song for Bri to record. Even though Bri does not agree with the lyrics, she reluctantly agrees to record the song, hoping to impress a white record executive.  
Bri returns to the Ring once more, where she is supposed to perform the song she recorded. Instead, Bri freestyles her own lyrics about refusing to be what people think she should be. The record executive angrily walks out, but the crowd goes wild. Later, an unnamed celebrity retweets the video of Bri’s freestyle and calls her the future of hip-hop. Bri decides that she will pursue a rap career, but only if she can do it on her own terms."
Visible,"Refugee follows the stories of three different children and their families, each attempting to flee their violent homelands, in different regions of the world and during different decades. Josef and his family flee Nazi Germany in 1938; Isabel and her family flee Cuba in 1994; and Mahmoud and his family flee Syria in 2015.
Josef Landau is a twelve-year-old boy living in Berlin. In 1938, his home is raided by Nazi storm troopers, and his father is taken to the Dachau concentration camp. Six months later, his mother receives a telegram that her husband has been released, but the family must leave Germany immediately. Josef, his sister Ruth, and his mother all travel to Hamburg to board a ship that will take them to Cuba. When Josef’s father is reunited with his family, they notice that Dachau has changed him: he is paranoid and very thin. They board the St. Louis, a large German ship, and set out.
Aboard the St. Louis, Josef’s family and the other passengers, all Jewish refugees, are treated well by Captain Schroeder and most of the ship’s crew. A few of the crew, however, openly dislike the Jewish passengers, especially Otto Schiendick, who proudly states his Nazi allegiance. When the St. Louis reaches Havana Harbor in Cuba, the ship is not allowed to dock. Josef’s father’s mental state deteriorates further, and he eventually jumps from the ship, trying to kill himself. Officer Padron, a Cuban policeman assigned to the St. Louis, saves Josef’s father. Josef’s father is taken to Havana to recover. When Officer Padron returns to the St. Louis, he is treated like a hero by the Jewish passengers. 
Eventually, the captain announces that they are not going to be allowed to dock in Havana and that the boat will be leaving. He promises the passengers that he will try to deliver them to a country other than Germany. The refugees aboard the St. Louis are delivered to England, Belgium, the Netherlands, and France. The Nazis invade France just a few months after Josef’s family arrives there. When the family is eventually caught, Josef’s mother is forced to choose which of her children will be freed and which will be sent to a concentration camp.
Isabel Fernandez is an eleven-year-old girl who lives just outside Havana in 1994. After the fall of the Soviet Union, Cuba has become inhospitable for most of its citizens under the regime of Fidel Castro. Isabel’s best friend and neighbor, Iván, is building a small boat with his father so that his family can flee to America. After a riot in Havana, Isabel’s family decides that they should also leave Cuba immediately. Isabel trades her trumpet to a fisherman for gasoline, paying her family’s way onto Iván’s family’s boat. Lito, Isabel’s grandfather, also joins them. 
The two families face many challenges as they try to cross the Caribbean Sea to Florida. A storm sweeps them to the Bahamas, where they are not allowed to disembark; Iván is attacked by sharks and eventually bleeds to death in the boat; and toward the end of the journey, Isabel’s pregnant mother goes into labor. Lito tells the story of the St. Louis and how he had to turn away so many refugees when he was a young policeman. (He is Officer Padron from Josef’s story.) Just when Miami becomes visible on the horizon, a U.S. Coast Guard boat tries to intercept the two families. Lito jumps in the water to distract the Coast Guard, and Isabel’s mother gives birth to a boy, just as they reach the shore. When Isabel is asked to play a song at her new school in America, she plays a Cuban salsa version of “The Star-Spangled Banner.”
Mahmoud Bishara is a twelve-year-old boy who lives in Aleppo, Syria in 2015. For the last few years, there has been a war in his country between the Syrian government, rebels, the Soviets, the United States and several other factions. After Mahmoud’s home is destroyed, his brother Waleed, sister Hana, and his parents drive to the border of Turkey, hoping to escape. Mahmoud’s father tells them that Germany is accepting Syrian refugees and if they can get to Greece, they will be able to travel within the European Union to reach Germany. After a violent conflict between the rebels and the Syrian government, Mahmoud and his family walk to the Turkish border. Mahmoud’s father arranges for a smuggler to take them to the island of Lesbos, in Greece. The smuggler’s raft is destroyed by rocks as they cross the Mediterranean. Mahmoud hands his sister, Hana, to another passing raft of refugees, knowing that his mother cannot hold her and swim. The family is eventually pulled from the water by the Greek Coast Guard. 
Mahmoud and his family travel through Serbia and into Hungary, where they are detained at a refugee camp that is built like a prison. Mahmoud decides that he no longer wants to be ignored and leads the refugees out of the prison, walking twelve hours to Austria. The refugees are welcomed in Austria, and Mahmoud’s family takes a train to Germany. While they travel, they ask if anyone has seen Hana. After a few weeks in Munich, Mahmoud’s family is transferred to a host family in Berlin. An elderly couple, Herr and Frau Rosenberg, welcome them into their home. Frau Rosenberg takes Mahmoud aside and tells him the story of her childhood: she is Ruth, Josef’s sister. The night that they were captured in France, Josef volunteered to be taken by the Nazis; both Josef and their mother were killed in concentration camps. Ruth promises to help Mahmoud find Hana."
Representations,"Lawyer Bryan Stevenson gives a first-person account of his decades helping marginalized Americans who have been unfairly and harshly punished by the U.S. criminal justice system, which disproportionately targets people of color and poor people. At the heart of Just Mercy is the story of Walter McMillian, a Black man who was framed for the murder of a girl named Ronda Morrison, convicted, and sent to death row. 
Stevenson alternates chapters about Walter with his personal reflections on our country’s history with racial disparity and issues around incarceration. Stevenson highlights other groups of vulnerable people who have been victimized by the criminal justice system and shares the stories of the prisoners he has helped over the years. The book also follows the growth of Stevenson’s nonprofit law project, the Alabama-based Equal Justice Initiative (EJI), through its expansion from focusing on death row prisoners to helping people sentenced to life without parole. Stevenson chronicles how EJI becomes a significant force in criminal justice reform.
In 1983 as a law student, Stevenson discovers his life’s passion when he interns with the Georgia-based Southern Prisoners Defense Committee and meets his first death row prisoner. After graduation Stevenson accepts a job with the organization to represent poor prisoners, including those in Alabama who lack any public defender. He meets Walter McMillian on Alabama’s death row. Walter owns a successful business but also transgresses racial boundaries when he has an affair with a white woman. Soon after the affair becomes public, the woman’s friend, Ralph Myers, accuses Walter of committing the unsolved murder of Ronda Morrison, which has outraged the community. Law enforcement, including a racist sheriff and the district attorney, eagerly pounces on this accusation, overlooking Walter’s alibi and a lack of evidence. Instead, they actively force Ralph to stick with his story even when he tries to recant. They coerce other false witness testimonies, and—as revealed years later—actively suppress evidence.
After Stevenson and the team at EJI unsuccessfully appeal Walter’s conviction, they launch their own investigation of the crime and uncover new evidence. They find witnesses who can prove the witnesses against Walter lied as well as financial records that indicate that one of these witnesses was paid to give false testimony. Stevenson and his team also petition for and receive all records from Walter’s trial. However, their big break comes when they receive a phone call from Ralph, who now wants to make amends. Ralph admits to lying about Walter and says he was threatened by law enforcement. Stevenson wins a hearing for Walter where he can present his new evidence: Ralph’s testimony, which is confirmed by health care workers and other inmates, as well as recordings of the law enforcement team threatening Ralph if he doesn’t frame Walter. 
While the judge refuses to grant Walter relief, Stevenson continues the appeal process through the Alabama courts. The district attorney asks outside agents to investigate the murder for which Walter was convicted, and the investigators determine that Walter had nothing to do with the crime. Six weeks later, the court invalidates Walter’s conviction. Stevenson and the State file a joint motion to dismiss the charges, and Walter is set free.
Throughout the process, Stevenson and Walter become close friends, and Stevenson helps Walter upon his release, including filing a civil suit on his behalf and offering him a place to stay. Walter works with Stevenson to share his story, giving interviews and speaking at legal conferences, and Walter is even featured in a documentary. Unfortunately, Walter is diagnosed with advancing dementia and is forced to rely on family and eventually a nursing facility for his care. He dies in 2013. Stevenson gives a eulogy at his funeral and shares all he learned from Walter, particularly that we must extend mercy to everyone, even those who have not earned it.
Interspersed with chapters chronicling Walter’s narrative are stories of Stevenson’s other clients and work. His closeness with these prisoners and their horrifying circumstances makes Stevenson more determined to help and causes him to reflect on abstract issues that nevertheless imbue the criminal justice system, like humanity and mercy. Stevenson focuses on several categories of vulnerable people who become trapped in the system, including mentally ill prisoners, disabled prisoners, and poor women who give birth to stillborn babies. 
Stevenson and his team at EJI also become increasingly focused on juvenile offenders who are sometimes tried as adults despite their young age. These offenders may be given de facto death sentences by being sentenced to life without parole and face perilous circumstances when they are housed in adult prisons. Stevenson illustrates how these prisoners retain their own humanity while being forced to live under inhumane conditions. He also discusses some of the qualities common among these types of prisoners: They are generally poor and disproportionately people of color, and most of them lack adequate legal counsel. The juveniles have horrific backgrounds of abuse and neglect.
Stevenson and his team at EJI also work to change the legal system to offer more protection to marginalized people. Several of his cases end up before the U.S. Supreme Court, and he succeeds in winning rulings that ban as unconstitutional the conviction of children to life without parole and the execution of people deemed incompetent from dementia or neurological disease. EJI works to raise public awareness of issues surrounding unfair incarceration, produces groundbreaking reports on racial issues, and sets up programs to help formerly incarcerated people adjust to life on the outside.
Stevenson also reflects on the issues that surround the criminal justice system. His time spent with prisoners awaiting their execution makes him realize how inhumane it is to prepare another human to die. After decades of work, when Stevenson fails to prevent the execution of a man who suffers from an intellectual disability, he momentarily feels unable to continue his work. However, he realizes that he cannot help but be broken by his experiences and comes to understand that it is his own brokenness that allows him to more fully understand the need for mercy and to bring compassion to others. The book ends with Stevenson’s renewed commitment to helping others."
Slowly,"Meursault, the narrator, is a young man living in Algiers. After receiving a telegram informing him of his mother’s death, he takes a bus to Marengo, where his mother had been living in an old persons’ home. He sleeps for almost the entire trip. When he arrives, he speaks to the director of the home. The director allows Meursault to see his mother, but Meursault finds that her body has already been sealed in the coffin. He declines the caretaker’s offer to open the coffin.
That night, Meursault keeps vigil over his mother’s body. Much to his displeasure, the talkative caretaker stays with him the whole time. Meursault smokes a cigarette, drinks coffee, and dozes off. The next morning, before the funeral, he meets with the director again. The director informs him that Thomas Perez, an old man who had grown very close to Meursault’s mother, will be attending the funeral service. The funeral procession heads for the small local village, but Perez has difficulty keeping up and eventually faints from the heat. Meursault reports that he remembers little of the funeral. That night, he happily arrives back in Algiers.
The next day, Meursault goes to the public beach for a swim. There, he runs into Marie Cardona, his former co-worker. The two make a date to see a comedy at the movie theater that evening. After the movie they spend the night together. When Meursault wakes up, Marie is gone. He stays in bed until noon and then sits on his balcony until evening, watching the people pass on the street.
The following day, Monday, Meursault returns to work. He has lunch with his friend Emmanuel and then works all afternoon. While walking upstairs to his apartment that night, Meursault runs into Salamano, an old man who lives in his building and owns a mangy dog. Meursault also runs into his neighbor, Raymond Sintes, who is widely rumored to be a pimp. Raymond invites Meursault over for dinner. Over the meal, Raymond recounts how he beat up his mistress after he discovered that she had been cheating on him. As a result, he got into a fight with her brother. Raymond now wants to torment his mistress even more, but he needs Meursault to write a letter to lure his mistress back to him. Meursault agrees and writes the letter that night.
The following Saturday, Marie visits Meursault at his apartment. She asks Meursault if he loves her, and he replies that “it didn’t mean anything,” but probably not. The two then hear shouting coming from Raymond’s apartment. They go out into the hall and watch as a policeman arrives. The policeman slaps Raymond and says that he will be summoned to the police station for beating up his mistress. Later, Raymond asks Meursault to testify on his behalf, and Meursault agrees. That night, Raymond runs into Salamano, who laments that his dog has run away.
Marie asks Meursault if he wants to marry her. He replies indifferently but says that they can get married if she wants to, so they become engaged. The following Sunday, Meursault, Marie, and Raymond go to a beach house owned by Masson, one of Raymond’s friends. They swim happily in the ocean and then have lunch. That afternoon, Masson, Raymond, and Meursault run into two Arabs on the beach, one of whom is the brother of Raymond’s mistress. A fight breaks out and Raymond is stabbed. After tending to his wounds, Raymond returns to the beach with Meursault. They find the Arabs at a spring. Raymond considers shooting them with his gun, but Meursault talks him out of it and takes the gun away. Later, however, Meursault returns to the spring to cool off, and, for no apparent reason, he shoots Raymond’s mistress’s brother.
Meursault is arrested and thrown into jail. His lawyer seems disgusted at Meursault’s lack of remorse over his crime, and, in particular, at Meursault’s lack of grief at his mother’s funeral. Later, Meursault meets with the examining magistrate, who cannot understand Meursault’s actions. The magistrate brandishes a crucifix and demands that Meursault put his faith in God. Meursault refuses, insisting that he does not believe in God. The magistrate cannot accept Meursault’s lack of belief, and eventually dubs him “Monsieur Antichrist.”
One day, Marie visits Meursault in prison. She forces herself to smile during the visit, and she expresses hope that Meursault will be acquitted and that they will get married. As he awaits his trial, Meursault slowly adapts to prison life. His isolation from nature, women, and cigarettes torments him at first, but he eventually adjusts to living without them, and soon does not even notice their absence. He manages to keep his mind occupied, and he sleeps for most of each day.
Meursault is taken to the courthouse early on the morning of his trial. Spectators and members of the press fill the courtroom. The subject of the trial quickly shifts away from the murder to a general discussion of Meursault’s character, and of his reaction to his mother’s death in particular. The director and several other people who attended the vigil and the funeral are called to testify, and they all attest to Meursault’s lack of grief or tears. Marie reluctantly testifies that the day after his mother’s funeral she and Meursault went on a date and saw a comedic movie. During his summation the following day, the prosecutor calls Meursault a monster and says that his lack of moral feeling threatens all of society. Meursault is found guilty and is sentenced to death by beheading.
Meursault returns to prison to await his execution. He struggles to come to terms with his situation, and he has trouble accepting the certainty and inevitability of his fate. He imagines escaping and he dreams of filing a successful legal appeal. One day, the chaplain comes to visit against Meursault’s wishes. He urges Meursault to renounce his atheism and turn to God, but Meursault refuses. Like the magistrate, the chaplain cannot believe that Meursault does not long for faith and the afterlife. Meursault suddenly becomes enraged, grabs the chaplain, and begins shouting at him. He declares that he is correct in believing in a meaningless, purely physical world. For the first time, Meursault truly embraces the idea that human existence holds no greater meaning. He abandons all hope for the future and accepts the “gentle indifference of the world.” This acceptance makes Meursault feel happy."
Americansâ,"Ifemelu, a Nigerian woman who lives in Princeton, New Jersey, gets her hair braided in preparation for her upcoming return to Nigeria. She has broken up with her boyfriend, Blaine, closed her popular blog about race, and uprooted her life because she feels weighed down. When she thinks of returning to Nigeria, she can’t help but think of Obinze, her first love, now a wealthy man in Lagos with a wife and daughter. Upon receiving an email from Ifemelu, Obinze becomes distracted. He has stumbled into wealth after his cousin introduces him to a well-connected man. His wife, Kosi, is beautiful and adoring, but they never connected on the emotional level that he and Ifemelu did. That night, he listens to the music he and Ifemelu used to listen to when they made love.
The novel flashes back to Ifemelu’s youth. She and Obinze meet at a party where a friend attempts to set Obinze up with a girl named Ginika. Obinze has admired Ifemelu from afar since transferring to their school, and they immediately hit it off. They date all throughout secondary school and through the start of university. However, university lecturer strikes keep closing the universities, and Obinze and Aunty Uju encourage Ifemelu to apply to school in America. Ifemelu is accepted and then quickly approved for a student visa. Ifemelu and Obinze plan to one day reunite in America. Unfortunately, Ifemelu’s student visa does not allow her to work, and without a full scholarship and stipend, Ifemelu must find a source of income. She applies to jobs using a family friend’s social security card to no avail. In desperation, she agrees to work for a shady tennis coach as his “relaxation assistant,” which involves allowing him to touch her sexually. After one meeting, she never returns to the coach. Out of shame and self-loathing, she stops replying to Obinze’s messages and emails.
Ifemelu’s luck changes when Ginika introduces her to Kimberly, a white woman who needs a babysitter. The steady work offers her a chance to focus on her studies. She meets Kimberly’s wealthy cousin, Curt, who is immediately smitten with her. They start dating, and when Ifemelu graduates, Curt helps her get a job that will sponsor her green card. For the job interview, Ifemelu needs to have her hair relaxed so that it will look professional according to American standards. The relaxer burns her scalp, and her friend Wambui encourages her to try wearing her hair natural. At first, Ifemelu thinks her hair is ugly, but soon grows to love it. One day, she runs into a friend from Nigeria, who asks what happened between her and Obinze. She gives him the cold shoulder, and is upset the rest of the day. Although she explains that the university friend was not an ex-boyfriend, Curt acts possessive.
Meanwhile, Obinze lives as an illegal immigrant in London. His American visa application was rejected because of anti-terror panic after the September 11, 2001 attacks. His mother offers to bring him as a research assistant on a trip to London as a way to get him into Britain. Obinze’s friend links him up with a fellow Nigerian, Vincent, who is willing to let him use his national insurance card in order to work if Obinze will give him a percentage of his income. Obinze agrees and finds a job in a warehouse. Eventually, Vincent demands more money. Obinze refuses, and the next day his boss tells him that someone reported him as an illegal immigrant. Desperate, Obinze tries to find someone to arrange a green card marriage for him. The day Obinze’s wedding is meant to take place, he arrives to the courthouse only to find the police awaiting him. Obinze is deported.
Ifemelu cheats on Curt and ends their relationship. After she writes an email to Wambui detailing her frustration with Curt’s inability to understand the necessity of Essence magazine in a world of beauty magazines catering to white women, Wambui suggests Ifemelu start blogging. Ifemelu starts a blog focusing on her observations on race in America as a non-American Black woman, and her clever posts soon lead to its popularity. At a conference for minority bloggers, she runs into Blaine, a Black American professor at Yale. They begin dating, and Ifemelu moves in with him. When Ifemelu does not attend a protest Blaine organizes against the university’s racial profiling of a Black staff member, they have a major fight and almost break up. However, Barack Obama’s presidential candidacy draws them back together and gives them a joint mission up until the election, and Ifemelu’s subsequent decision to leave.
Aunty Uju calls Ifemelu to tell her that her son, Dike, tried to kill himself. Ifemelu rushes to be with him. Once she’s back in Nigeria, Ifemelu slowly finds her feet. However, she is hesitant to contact Obinze. Finally, she texts him, and he wants to meet up with her as soon as possible. Their attraction is still undeniable. When Obinze asks her why she cut him off, Ifemelu tells him the story of the tennis coach, surprised at her own tears. Obinze holds her hand, and she basks in the safety she feels. After more dates, Ifemelu awkwardly rekindles their sexual relationship, although she does not want to be his mistress. They argue, and Ifemelu calls Obinze a coward for not divorcing Kosi. Shaken, Obinze thinks about Ifemelu’s accusation, and finds truth in it. He asks Kosi for a divorce. Kosi tries to ignore his declaration, reminding him that he has a duty to his family. Obinze decides that he doesn’t want his daughter to grow up with her parents only playing the roles of happy husband and wife. Days later, he shows up at Ifemelu’s flat telling her that he has left Kosi, will continue to be present in his daughter’s life, and wants to be with Ifemelu. Ifemelu invites him in."
Dispassionate,"Mitch Albom, the book's narrator, recalls his graduation from Brandeis University in the spring of 1979. After he has received his diploma, Mitch approaches his favorite professor, Morrie Schwartz, and presents him with a monogrammed briefcase. While at Brandeis, Mitch takes almost all of the sociology courses Morrie had teaches. He promises Morrie, who is crying, that he will keep in touch, though he does not fulfill his promise. Years after Mitch's graduation from Brandeis, Morrie is forced to forfeit dancing, his favorite hobby, because he has been diagnosed with ALS, a debilitating disease that leaves his ""soul, perfectly awake, imprisoned inside a limp husk"" of a body. Morrie's wife, Charlotte, cares for Morrie, though at his insistence, keeps her job as a professor at M.I.T.
Sixteen years after his graduation from Brandeis, Mitch is feeling frustrated with the life he has chosen to live. After his uncle dies of pancreatic cancer, Mitch abandons his failing career as a musician to become a well-paid journalist for a Detroit newspaper. Mitch promises his wife Janine that they will have children eventually, though he spends all of his time at work, away on reporting assignments. One night, Mitch is flipping the channels on his television and recognizes Morrie's voice. Morrie is being featured on the television program ""Nightline"" in the first of three interviews with Ted Koppel, whom he quickly befriends. Before consenting to be interviewed, Morrie surprises and softens the famed newscaster when he asks Koppel what is ""close to his heart."" Mitch is stunned to see his former professor on television.
Following Morrie's television appearance, Mitch contacts his beloved professor and travels from his home in Detroit to Morrie's home in West Newton, Massachusetts to visit with him. When Mitch drives up to Morrie's house, he delays greeting his professor because he is speaking on the phone with his producer, a decision he later regrets.
Shortly after his reunion with Morrie, Mitch works himself nearly to death reporting on the Wimbledon tennis tournament in London. There, he spends much time thinking about Morrie and forfeits reading the tabloids, as he now seeks more meaning in his life and knows that he will not gain this meaning from reading about celebrities and gossip. He is knocked over by a swarm of reporters chasing celebrities Andre Agassi and Brooke Shields, and it is then that Mitch realizes he is chasing after the wrong thing. When he returns to his home in Detroit, Mitch learns that the article he has worked so hard to write will not even be published, as the union he belongs to is striking against the newspaper he works for. Once more, Mitch travels to Boston to visit Morrie.
Following their first Tuesday together, Mitch returns regularly every Tuesday to listen to Morrie's lessons on ""The Meaning of Life."" Each week, Mitch brings Morrie food to eat, though as Morrie's condition worsens he is no longer able to enjoy solid food. In his first of three interviews with Koppel for ""Nightline,"" Morrie admits that the thing he dreads most about his worsening condition is that someday, he will not be able to wipe himself after using the bathroom. Eventually, this fear comes true.
Interspersed throughout Mitch's visits to Morrie are flashbacks to their days together at Brandeis. Mitch describes himself as a student who had acted tough, but had sought the tenderness he recognized in Morrie. At Brandeis, Mitch and Morrie shared a relationship more like that between father and son than teacher and student. Soon before Morrie's death, when his condition has deteriorated so much that he can no longer breathe or move on his own, he confides that if he could have another son, he would choose Mitch.
In his childhood, Morrie had been very poor. His father, Charlie had been cold and dispassionate, and had neglected to provide for Morrie and his younger brother emotionally and financially. At the age of eight, Morrie must read the telegram that brings news of his mother's death, as he is the only one in his family who can read English. Charlie marries Eva, a kind woman who gives Morrie and his brother the love and affection they need. Eva also instills in Morrie his love of books and his desire for education. However, Charlie insists that Morrie keep his mother's death a secret, as he wants Morrie's younger brother to believe that Eva is his biological mother. This demand to keep his mother's death a secret proves a terrible emotional burden for young Morrie; he keeps the telegram all of his life as proof that his mother had existed. Because he was starved of love and affection during his childhood, Morrie seeks it out in his old age from his family and friends. Now that he is nearing his death, Morrie says that he has reverted to a figurative infancy, and tries in earnest ""enjoy being a baby again."" He and Mitch often hold hands throughout their sessions together.
In his lessons, Morrie advises Mitch to reject the popular culture in favor of creating his own. The individualistic culture Morrie encourages Mitch to create for himself is a culture founded on love, acceptance, and human goodness, a culture that upholds a set of ethical values unlike the mores that popular culture endorses. Popular culture, Morrie says, is founded on greed, selfishness, and superficiality, which he urges Mitch to overcome. Morrie also stresses that he and Mitch must accept death and aging, as both are inevitable.
On one Tuesday, Janine travels with Mitch to visit Morrie. Janine is a professional singer, and Morrie asks her to sing for him. Though she does not usually sing upon request, Janine concedes, and her voice moves Morrie to tears. Morrie cries freely and often, and continually encourages Mitch to do so also. As Morrie's condition deteriorates, so does that of the pink hibiscus plant that sits on the window ledge in his study. Mitch becomes increasingly aware of the evil in media, as it drenches the country with stories of murder and hatred. One such story is the murder trial of O.J. Simpson, the verdict of which causes major racial division between whites and blacks.
Mitch tape records his discussions with Morrie so that he may compile notes with which to write a book, Tuesdays With Morrie, a project which he and Morrie refer to as their ""last thesis together."" Morrie continually tells Mitch that he wants to share his stories with the world, a the book will allow him to do just that.
Meanwhile, at Morrie's insistence, Mitch attempts to restore his relationship with his brother Peter who lives in Spain. For many years, Peter has refused his family's help in battling pancreatic cancer and insists on seeking treatment alone. Mitch calls Peter and leaves numerous phone messages, though the only reply he receives from his brother is a curt message in which Peter insists he is fine, and reminds Mitch that he does not want to talk about his illness. Morrie prophetizes that Mitch will once more become close with his brother, a prophecy which, after Morrie's death, is realized. At Morrie's funeral, Mitch recalls his promise to continue his conversations with his professor and conducts a silent dialogue with Morrie in his head. Mitch had expected such a dialogue to feel awkward, however this communication feels far more natural than he had ever expected."
Attack,"Brian Robeson, a thirteen-year-old from New York City, boards a plan headed from Hampton, New York to the Canadian north woods to visit his father. His parents' recent divorce weighs heavily on him, as does ""The Secret"" that his mother is having an affair. The pilot gives him a very brief flying lesson in which Brian has control of the plane for a few minutes. The pilot seems to be experiencing increasing pain in his shoulder, arm, and stomach. At first Brian does not think it is very serious, but as the pilot begins jerking in his seat it becomes clear that he is having a heart attack. The attack stops and the pilot is dead; Brian is forced to take over the controls. After a harrowing descent, the plane crashes into a lake in the Canadian woods, where Brian is stranded.
Brian has little to eat and is injured from the crash, but believes he will soon be rescued. He finds some strange berries to eat, which make him extremely sick. He then finds a raspberry patch, where he spots a bear. Brian constructs a shelter and in the middle of the night he hears a noise. A porcupine has entered his shelter and Brian throws the hatchet in its direction. It shoots its quills into Brian's leg, causing him severe pain. Brian attempts to build a fire with no matches and eventually succeeds when he learns how to strike his hatchet against a stone to ignite sparks. He finds turtle eggs and eagerly eats them. One day a plane flies overhead but does not see him and continues on its way, leaving Brian devastated and hopeless. He attempts to commit suicide by cutting himself with his hatchet, but survives the attempt and emerges from the experience determined to embrace life and to take an active role in his own fate.
Brian soon catches his first fish and enjoys a big feast. That night, however, a skunk enters the shelter and when Brian yells at the skunk, it sprays him, temporarily blinding him and covering him with a horrible stench. Brian perfects his tools and catches a foolbird, his first meat. While he is cleaning the bird in the water, a moose attacks Brian, injuring his ribs and his shoulder. Another unfortunate incident soon follows when a tornado sweeps over the woods and destroys Brian's shelter.
The day after the tornado, Brian discovers that the chaotic storm has riled up the water in the lake, and the tail of the plane had emerged from the lake, reminding Brian of the dead pilot and compelling him to say a few words for him. Lying in bed one night, it occurs to Brian that he could seek out the survival pack in the body of the plane, and he determines to build a raft to do so. After many incidents of trial-and-error, Brian retrieves the survival pack from the plane. At one point he drops the hatchet to the lake's bottom, but retrieves it with a long dive. On his way back up to the surface, Brian sees the dead pilot's head underwater, partially eaten by fish. Brian gets sick in the water but manages to make it back to his shelter to get some sleep.
The next morning Brian opens the survival pack, which contains countless useful items, some of which Brian rejects in favor of the self-sufficient methods he has developed during his time in the woods. However, there is freeze-dried food that he decides to cook immediately. He also finds something labeled ""Emergency Transmitter."" He fiddles with it but it appears not to function. As Brian is preparing his much-anticipated meal, a plane lands on the lake to rescue a dumbfounded Brian sitting down to eat his freeze-dried meal."
11,"In an event called “the collapse,” a deadly flu epidemic sweeps the globe and kills most of the world’s population. The plot of Station Eleven revolves around a few main characters and offers glimpses into their lives both before the collapse and during the nineteen years that follow. Chapters often jump forward or backward in time, and shift focus and perspective from one character to another.
Arthur Leander is born on an island off the west coast of Canada. Dreaming of a more exciting life, he moves to Toronto, where he meets Clark Thompson, who becomes his closest friend. Arthur pursues an acting career, eventually becoming a very successful stage and screen actor. In Toronto, he meets a young woman named Miranda Carroll, an aspiring artist who grew up on the same island as Arthur. The two eventually marry.
Arthur and Miranda celebrate their third wedding anniversary with a dinner party at their Hollywood Hills home that Clark attends. During the party, Miranda realizes that she dislikes Arthur’s shallow movie-industry friends, and she also discovers that Arthur is romantically involved with Elizabeth Colton, one of the party guests. Elizabeth drinks too much and passes out on the couch, and the other guests go home. Miranda stays up late working on her comic book, Dr. Eleven. She goes outside and talks to one of the paparazzi stationed across the street. The man, Jeevan Chaudhary, takes an unflattering picture of her.
Jeevan does not like being a paparazzo and instead becomes an entertainment journalist. Later, Jeevan interviews Arthur Leander. After Miranda and Arthur divorce, Arthur marries Elizabeth Colton. Arthur and Elizabeth have a son, Tyler, but Arthur later divorces Elizabeth as well, marrying an actress named Lydia Marks. Elizabeth and Tyler move to Israel.
Years later, Arthur plays King Lear in a stage production in Toronto. Miranda visits him there and gives him two sets of the first two issues of Dr. Eleven. Arthur has decided that he wants to give up acting and move to Israel to live near his son Tyler. He sends one copy of Dr. Eleven to Tyler and gives the other to Kirsten Raymonde, an eight-year-old girl with a small role in the King Lear production. 
Jeevan, who has been training to be a paramedic in an attempt to do something meaningful with his life, attends King Lear in Toronto, excited to see Arthur Leander on stage. During the performance, Arthur has a heart attack and collapses, and Jeevan jumps onto the stage in an unsuccessful attempt to revive him. After Arthur’s sudden death on stage, Jeevan consoles Kirsten. Leaving the theater, Jeevan receives a call from a friend who is a doctor in a Toronto hospital. He tells Jeevan that the Georgia Flu has reached North America and is proving to be extremely virulent. Jeevan stocks up on food and supplies and goes to his paraplegic brother Frank’s apartment building. 
With a 99 percent mortality rate, the Georgia Flu kills much of the world’s population within a few weeks. This event becomes known as “the collapse.” Miranda dies on a beach in Malaysia, delirious with fever. Elizabeth and Tyler happen to be on the same plane as Clark—all three are traveling to Arthur’s funeral—when their plane is diverted to Severn City Airport. The airport is then closed, and most of the stranded passengers flee. Those remaining in the airport try to survive. Elizabeth believes that the Georgia Flu is a form of divine judgment and that she and Tyler have survived for a reason. Tyler’s behavior grows increasingly withdrawn and peculiar. Two years after the collapse, Elizabeth and Tyler leave the airport with a group of religious wanderers. Clark remains at the airport, and over the years he creates a Museum of Civilization in the airport that features artifacts from the time before the collapse.
Jeevan and Frank try to wait out the Georgia Flu in Frank’s apartment, but their supplies begin to dwindle. Frank worries that his disability is hurting Jeevan’s chances of survival, and he commits suicide so that Jeevan no longer has to care for him. Jeevan leaves the apartment and travels south, where he joins a settlement called McKinley and eventually marries and has two children. 
Kirsten Raymonde escapes Toronto with her older brother, and after her brother dies, she joins the Traveling Symphony, an orchestra that performs Shakespeare plays and diverse musical concerts for the settlements around the Great Lakes. Almost two decades after the collapse, Kirsten and the Symphony reach a town called St. Deborah by the Water. Since their last visit two years earlier, the town has been taken over by a religious zealot called “the Prophet.” The Traveling Symphony learns that the Prophet originally came from Severn City; unbeknownst to them, he is Arthur and Elizabeth’s son Tyler. The Symphony asks about Charlie and Jeremy, two members that they left behind on their prior visit. They learn that Charlie and Jeremy fled after the Prophet took over.
When the Traveling Symphony leaves the town, they find that a twelve-year-old girl, Eleanor, has snuck along with them as a stowaway. Some of the Prophet’s men pursue the Symphony to recover Eleanor because she is promised to the Prophet as his wife. Several members of the Symphony are captured by the Prophet’s men, and Kirsten and her friend August become separated. After killing some of the Prophet’s followers, Kirsten and August rescue one of the Symphony members. The Prophet eventually confronts Kirsten near Severn City, but he is killed by one of his own followers, a teenage boy who can no longer endure the terrible things that he has done while serving the Prophet. 
Kirsten and August reunite with the Charlie, Jeremy, and the Traveling Symphony at the Severn City Airport. Kirsten meets Clark and shares her two issues of Dr. Eleven with him. Through a telescope, Clark shows her a distant town to the south that has electricity. When the Traveling Symphony leaves, Clark is hopeful about the future of humanity."
Inured,"Cadence, nearly eighteen, narrates her story in the first person. In Part One (“Welcome”), she describes the three generations of her family, the Sinclairs; Granddad, widowed; his three daughters, all divorced or separated from their husbands; and Cadence and her six cousins. The family spends every summer on a family-owned island. One aunt’s longtime boyfriend and his nephew, Gat, always join them there, even though Granddad doesn’t like the fact that they are of South Asian descent. Cadence, her two oldest cousins, and Gat are known in the family as “the Liars,” for unexplained reasons. Cadence and Gat fell in love when Cadence was fourteen, but the next summer there was an accident of some sort. Cadence doesn’t recall much, but apparently she suffered a head injury. She now has migraines, for which she takes prescription pain medication. None of the Liars stayed in touch with Cadence during her long recovery. The following summer, when her father took her on a trip to Europe, they didn’t reply to her emails.
In Part Two (“Vermont”), Cadence struggles to remember more of her accident. When she asks Penny for details, Penny replies tearfully that Cadence has asked many times before, and always finds the answers upsetting. When Cadence’s father wants to take her to Europe again next summer, Cadence insists on returning to the island. Her mother and father reluctantly settle on a plan for her to spend just the first month of the summer there. Meanwhile, it becomes clear during a visit from Granddad and a phone call with one of the younger cousins that all is not well with the family. Granddad’s mind is starting to fail, the younger cousins gossip about Cadence being a drug addict, and the cousin on the phone thinks the island is haunted.
Part Three (“Summer Seventeen”) begins with Cadence’s arrival at the island. To her shock, the old Victorian house where Granddad and Granny used to live has been completely rebuilt, as an unattractive modern structure. She reunites awkwardly with her aunts and the younger cousins, but her reunion with the Liars goes better, despite her resentment over not hearing from them in the last two years. The four Liars agree to stay together and not to spend much time with the rest of the family. Over the next week or two, Cadence begins to remember what happened two summers ago. Granddad and his daughters argued about the family home back in Boston. One aunt was resentful over the condition of her house on the island. Granddad also snapped at Cadence one day, about his right to do with his money as he pleased. In the present, Cadence makes progress reconnecting with the Liars, but they’re not very responsive to her questions about her accident.
In Part Four (“Look, a Fire”), Cadence starts to grasp what really happened. There had been an ugly showdown between Granddad and his daughters, about the division of the family inheritance. The fight ended with all four adults angrily leaving the island for a short time, taking the younger cousins with them. The Liars stayed behind. Since much of the family conflict had been about Granddad’s house and its contents, the Liars had deliberately burned the house down. Cadence is pleased that in the new house, Granddad and his daughters treat each other more kindly. Cadence’s feelings change, however, when she realizes that Granddad’s two dogs died in the fire. She and the other Liars are responsible for their deaths.
In Part Five (“Truth”), finally, Cadence confronts the whole truth: she alone survived the fire. The other three Liars died. They have spent the last few weeks with Cadence as ghosts, waiting for her to remember and understand. Now the Liars must leave. Cadence says final goodbyes to her two cousins and her beloved Gat. She carries with her the guilty knowledge of her role in their deaths. She is resolved to be kinder toward her surviving family from now on."
Assertions,"The full title of Swift's pamphlet is ""A Modest Proposal for Preventing the Children of Poor People from Being a Burthen to their Parents, or the Country, and for Making them Beneficial to the Publick."" The tract is an ironically conceived attempt to ""find out a fair, cheap, and easy Method"" for converting the starving children of Ireland into ""sound and useful members of the Commonwealth."" Across the country poor children, predominantly Catholics, are living in squalor because their families are too poor to keep them fed and clothed.
The author argues, by hard-edged economic reasoning as well as from a self-righteous moral stance, for a way to turn this problem into its own solution. His proposal, in effect, is to fatten up these undernourished children and feed them to Ireland's rich land-owners. Children of the poor could be sold into a meat market at the age of one, he argues, thus combating overpopulation and unemployment, sparing families the expense of child-bearing while providing them with a little extra income, improving the culinary experience of the wealthy, and contributing to the overall economic well-being of the nation.
The author offers statistical support for his assertions and gives specific data about the number of children to be sold, their weight and price, and the projected consumption patterns. He suggests some recipes for preparing this delicious new meat, and he feels sure that innovative cooks will be quick to generate more. He also anticipates that the practice of selling and eating children will have positive effects on family morality: husbands will treat their wives with more respect, and parents will value their children in ways hitherto unknown. His conclusion is that the implementation of this project will do more to solve Ireland's complex social, political, and economic problems than any other measure that has been proposed."
Successful,"In Outliers: The Story of Success, Malcolm Gladwell considers the circumstances that lead to success. The first half of the book looks closely at how opportunities matter more in the lives of successful people than hard work or raw talent. The second half of the book focuses on cultural legacies: behavioral tendencies rooted in their ancestral past.
Part One examines the role of opportunity in the lives of extremely successful people. Gladwell’s first example is the Canadian Hockey League, the world’s most competitive youth hockey league. Since the cutoff date for the Canadian leagues that serve the youngest players is January 1, those born in the first part of the calendar year are much larger and more coordinated than their peers. The larger and more coordinated kids are given more playing time and better coaching, and thus become better players by the time they reach the top league. An overwhelming majority of Canadian professional hockey players have birthdays in January, February or March.
Gladwell proposes that 10,000 hours of practice is needed to master a skill, even for prodigies like Mozart. Bill Joy, Bill Gates, and the Beatles all worked hard to achieve success but benefited from opportunities they did not create. Joy, one of the founders of Sun Microsystems, happened to attend one of the first colleges in the world with a time-sharing terminal. In graduate school, he had a terminal in his room, where he spent all of his free time programming. Gates happened to attend a private high school with a time-sharing terminal connected to a mainframe in Seattle. He also was able to spend all of his free time programming. Early on, the Beatles were hired to play long shows day after day in Hamburg, Germany. 
Birth year or era is another form of opportunity. Gates and Joy (as well as other early programmers) all reached the end of their teen years just as personal computers became available to the public. In another example, fourteen of the top seventy-five richest people in the history of the world happened to be alive at the same time, in the same country: the United States in the mid-1800s.
Opportunity matters more than an individual’s IQ. Using a study conducted by Lewis Terman, the creator of the Stanford-Binet IQ test, Gladwell shows that “practical intelligence” is as important as “analytical intelligence.” He also contrasts Chris Langan, one of the world’s smartest living people, with Robert Oppenheimer. While both had difficulties in college, only Oppenheimer had a successful life, due to his practical intelligence.
The last portion of Part One looks at Joe Flom, a successful lawyer from New York City. While he was born into a poor family to Jewish immigrants (in a time when Jewish immigrants were not treated well), many of the disadvantages in his life were actually benefits and directly contributed to his success.
Part Two investigates cultural legacies. Using flight recorder transcripts from several plane crashes from the last few decades, Gladwell shows that cultural expectations and habits can be a severe hindrance to pilots. Copilots from countries that have a high “Power Distance Index” (those that show the most deference to authority) will often avoid telling pilots that they are making mistakes, even when the mistakes are potentially fatal. After recognizing the dangers of such cultural expectations, commercial aviation has instituted programs to change the way flight crews talk with one another. 
Gladwell next analyzes the disparity in public school math test scores between Eastern and Western countries. He suggests that the cultures in which rice paddy farming is historically important have a stronger work ethic. Using various examples, Gladwell shows that hard work has a greater impact on success in learning mathematics than intelligence. 
The final example is an examination of the KIPP school in the South Bronx and the “achievement gap” between socioeconomic groups. American students from middle-class and affluent households retain more information over summer vacation and are more likely to make additional gains than students from low-income households. The KIPP school uses longer school days and summer programming to eliminate the achievement gap for low-income children. While the work schedule is very rigorous, the school’s students go on to great academic success.
Gladwell demonstrates that if more opportunities were available, there would be far more successful people and the world would be richer for it."
Both,"Around midnight one September night in New York City, eighteen-year-old Mateo Torrez gets a phone call from the mysterious organization Death-Cast. Death-Cast’s employees notify people known as Deckers that they will die within twenty-four hours, but no one knows exactly when or how their deaths will occur. Mateo is alone when he gets the news. Mateo is often home alone because he struggles with anxiety. His mother died in childbirth, and his father has been in a coma for two weeks. Not long after, seventeen-year-old Rufus Emeterio also gets a phone call from Death-Cast notifying him of his impending death. Rufus is in the middle of beating up his ex-girlfriend’s new boyfriend, Peck, while his foster brothers, Malcom and Tagoe, look on. Rufus, Malcolm, and Tagoe are best friends who call themselves the Plutos. Rufus’s parents and older sister died four months earlier when their car crashed into the Hudson River. 
After struggling to leave his apartment for a couple of hours, Mateo signs up on the Last Friend app. Last Friend connects Deckers with someone to spend their last day alive, called an End Day. Meanwhile, Rufus coordinates his own funeral with The Plutos, his foster parents, and his ex-girlfriend, Aimee. Aimee used to be a part of the Plutos until she was adopted by her aunt. Aimee brings Peck to the funeral. While Aimee and Rufus argue, Peck gets a friend to call the police on Rufus for beating him up. When the police show up, the Plutos help Rufus escape, but Tagoe and Malcolm are arrested. Now alone on his End Day, Rufus signs up on the Last Friend app where he connects with Mateo. After chatting for a little while, Rufus goes to Mateo’s apartment. They decide to spend their End Day together. First, they visit the hospital so Mateo can say goodbye to his father. Then, they spend time at Rufus’s favorite diner before Mateo visits his best friend, a single mother named Lidia. Mateo spends some time alone with Lidia and her daughter, Penny, but does not tell her it’s his End Day. After, Rufus shows Mateo his Instagram account. All his photos since his parents and sister died are in black and white. Mateo convinces Rufus to document his End Day using color photos instead. 
Rufus takes a phone call from Aimee and finds out that Malcolm and Tagoe were arrested for helping him beat up Peck. Mateo overhears part of the conversation and takes off, scared that Rufus is dangerous. Rufus catches up to Mateo and explains why the police are after him. He opens up about his complicated relationship with Aimee and the tragic day he witnessed the deaths of his parents and sister. Mateo realizes Rufus is not dangerous and promises not to leave again. The boys decide to visit Make-a-Moment, a virtual reality company meant to provide Deckers with bucket list experiences before they die. Rufus and Mateo choose to try skydiving but find it disappointing. While wandering the city after, they discover some old payphones in a ditch and Rufus takes pictures to post to his Instagram account. After, they take the subway to the cemetery where Mateo’s mother is buried. The boys stumble upon cemetery workers already digging Mateo’s grave. Despite the upsetting scene, Mateo finds a sense of closure and resolves to live his life to the fullest on his End Day. Mateo convinces Rufus to visit a pier over the Hudson River to mourn his family so that Rufus may find the same sense of peace with his own grief. Afterward, they narrowly survive a bombing at a bookstore, and the experience makes Rufus realize how scared he is of dying.  
Mateo realizes it’s important to spend your End Day with loved ones. He calls Lidia, and he and Rufus meet her at the World Travel Arena, an interactive experience where Deckers can visit places they’ll never get to see in real life. Rufus holds Mateo’s hand, and Mateo realizes that he has feelings for Rufus. After, Rufus, Mateo, and Lidia decide to go to a Decker club. At the club, Mateo lets loose and sings in public for the first time, then kisses Rufus. The Plutos show up, and they’re all having a great time until Peck and his gang arrive. Peck has been stalking Rufus’s Instagram account to discover his location. He wants to kill Rufus as payback for the beating Rufus gave him. Peck threatens Rufus with a gun, but Mateo punches Peck, saving Rufus. All the boys begin to fight, and Rufus wrestles the gun away, shooting all the bullets into a wall. Everyone scatters, Peck and his gang are arrested, and Mateo and Rufus decide to go to Mateo’s apartment. 
At Mateo’s home, Rufus and Mateo talk about all the things they would have liked to have done together if they had more time. Mateo sings for Rufus and tells him he loves him. Rufus says he loves Mateo too, and they decide not to leave Mateo’s room and curl up together in the bed to nap. When Mateo wakes up, he decides to make them both tea, but when he turns on the stove, it explodes and kills him. Rufus wakes up to the smoke and searches for Mateo. Rufus drags Mateo’s body out of the apartment, but it is too late. Rufus is taken to the hospital, but he leaves after visiting Mateo’s father and leaving him a note. On his way to the park where he and Mateo spent time earlier, Rufus plays a video of Mateo singing. Distracted, he steps into the street. He doesn’t see the car speeding toward him."
Xa,"Malcolm X is born Malcolm Little in Omaha, Nebraska. The Midwest, during this period, is full of discrimination and racial violence. Malcolm’s family moves to Michigan where they continue to experience persecution and violence. White people murder Malcolm’s father and force his mother into a mental hospital. After living in a Michigan detention home and completing the eighth grade, Malcolm moves to Boston, Massachusetts, to live with his half-sister, Ella. In Boston Malcolm quickly becomes involved in urban nightlife. He passes for being much older than he is, wearing flashy clothes, gambling, drinking, doing drugs, and dating an older white woman, Sophia. Malcolm eventually takes a job as a railway porter. He then moves to New York, where he begins working as a hustler in Harlem. Malcolm’s various jobs there include running numbers, selling drugs, and steering white people to Black brothels. He also commits armed robberies.
When life in Harlem becomes too dangerous, Malcolm returns to Boston, where he becomes a house burglar and is eventually arrested. In prison, Malcolm transforms himself, converting to the branch of Islam promoted by the Nation of Islam, which has already converted a number of Malcolm’s siblings. Inspired by the faith, Malcolm stops using drugs; he reads voraciously, prays, studies English and Latin, and joins the prison debate team.
The prison releases Malcolm on parole. Malcolm moves in with his brother Wilfred and becomes very active in the Detroit temple of the Nation of Islam. Malcolm receives permission to drop his last name, which a white slave owner gave to one of his ancestors. He adopts the placeholder “X” as his last name, using the letter to represent the lost name of his African ancestors. Malcolm X soon meets the Nation of Islam’s leader, Elijah Muhammad, and rises quickly from the rank of temple assistant in Detroit to the Nation’s first national minister. Malcolm X becomes known throughout the United States, even outside of Muslim circles, as a fiery advocate for Black unity and militancy. The Nation of Islam’s leaders resent and fear Malcolm despite his allegiance to their cause, and they suspend him from the organization.
The Nation of Islam’s frustration with Malcolm intensifies, and Malcolm begins receiving death threats. After a divisive argument with Elijah Muhammad, Malcolm leaves the Nation of Islam. He uses his fame to found his own organization, Muslim Mosque, Inc. He sees his organization as more politically active than the Nation of Islam. On a trip to the Middle East and Africa, Malcolm discovers what he sees as true Islam. This version of Islam contrasts with the version of Islam he has been teaching. By the end of his life, Malcolm X is an international figure, welcomed by foreign leaders and committed to Islam as a religion that can alleviate the racial problems of the United States. He is assassinated in 1965."
Conviction,"Lawyer Bryan Stevenson gives a first-person account of his decades helping marginalized Americans who have been unfairly and harshly punished by the U.S. criminal justice system, which disproportionately targets people of color and poor people. At the heart of Just Mercy is the story of Walter McMillian, a Black man who was framed for the murder of a girl named Ronda Morrison, convicted, and sent to death row. 
Stevenson alternates chapters about Walter with his personal reflections on our country’s history with racial disparity and issues around incarceration. Stevenson highlights other groups of vulnerable people who have been victimized by the criminal justice system and shares the stories of the prisoners he has helped over the years. The book also follows the growth of Stevenson’s nonprofit law project, the Alabama-based Equal Justice Initiative (EJI), through its expansion from focusing on death row prisoners to helping people sentenced to life without parole. Stevenson chronicles how EJI becomes a significant force in criminal justice reform.
In 1983 as a law student, Stevenson discovers his life’s passion when he interns with the Georgia-based Southern Prisoners Defense Committee and meets his first death row prisoner. After graduation Stevenson accepts a job with the organization to represent poor prisoners, including those in Alabama who lack any public defender. He meets Walter McMillian on Alabama’s death row. Walter owns a successful business but also transgresses racial boundaries when he has an affair with a white woman. Soon after the affair becomes public, the woman’s friend, Ralph Myers, accuses Walter of committing the unsolved murder of Ronda Morrison, which has outraged the community. Law enforcement, including a racist sheriff and the district attorney, eagerly pounces on this accusation, overlooking Walter’s alibi and a lack of evidence. Instead, they actively force Ralph to stick with his story even when he tries to recant. They coerce other false witness testimonies, and—as revealed years later—actively suppress evidence.
After Stevenson and the team at EJI unsuccessfully appeal Walter’s conviction, they launch their own investigation of the crime and uncover new evidence. They find witnesses who can prove the witnesses against Walter lied as well as financial records that indicate that one of these witnesses was paid to give false testimony. Stevenson and his team also petition for and receive all records from Walter’s trial. However, their big break comes when they receive a phone call from Ralph, who now wants to make amends. Ralph admits to lying about Walter and says he was threatened by law enforcement. Stevenson wins a hearing for Walter where he can present his new evidence: Ralph’s testimony, which is confirmed by health care workers and other inmates, as well as recordings of the law enforcement team threatening Ralph if he doesn’t frame Walter. 
While the judge refuses to grant Walter relief, Stevenson continues the appeal process through the Alabama courts. The district attorney asks outside agents to investigate the murder for which Walter was convicted, and the investigators determine that Walter had nothing to do with the crime. Six weeks later, the court invalidates Walter’s conviction. Stevenson and the State file a joint motion to dismiss the charges, and Walter is set free.
Throughout the process, Stevenson and Walter become close friends, and Stevenson helps Walter upon his release, including filing a civil suit on his behalf and offering him a place to stay. Walter works with Stevenson to share his story, giving interviews and speaking at legal conferences, and Walter is even featured in a documentary. Unfortunately, Walter is diagnosed with advancing dementia and is forced to rely on family and eventually a nursing facility for his care. He dies in 2013. Stevenson gives a eulogy at his funeral and shares all he learned from Walter, particularly that we must extend mercy to everyone, even those who have not earned it.
Interspersed with chapters chronicling Walter’s narrative are stories of Stevenson’s other clients and work. His closeness with these prisoners and their horrifying circumstances makes Stevenson more determined to help and causes him to reflect on abstract issues that nevertheless imbue the criminal justice system, like humanity and mercy. Stevenson focuses on several categories of vulnerable people who become trapped in the system, including mentally ill prisoners, disabled prisoners, and poor women who give birth to stillborn babies. 
Stevenson and his team at EJI also become increasingly focused on juvenile offenders who are sometimes tried as adults despite their young age. These offenders may be given de facto death sentences by being sentenced to life without parole and face perilous circumstances when they are housed in adult prisons. Stevenson illustrates how these prisoners retain their own humanity while being forced to live under inhumane conditions. He also discusses some of the qualities common among these types of prisoners: They are generally poor and disproportionately people of color, and most of them lack adequate legal counsel. The juveniles have horrific backgrounds of abuse and neglect.
Stevenson and his team at EJI also work to change the legal system to offer more protection to marginalized people. Several of his cases end up before the U.S. Supreme Court, and he succeeds in winning rulings that ban as unconstitutional the conviction of children to life without parole and the execution of people deemed incompetent from dementia or neurological disease. EJI works to raise public awareness of issues surrounding unfair incarceration, produces groundbreaking reports on racial issues, and sets up programs to help formerly incarcerated people adjust to life on the outside.
Stevenson also reflects on the issues that surround the criminal justice system. His time spent with prisoners awaiting their execution makes him realize how inhumane it is to prepare another human to die. After decades of work, when Stevenson fails to prevent the execution of a man who suffers from an intellectual disability, he momentarily feels unable to continue his work. However, he realizes that he cannot help but be broken by his experiences and comes to understand that it is his own brokenness that allows him to more fully understand the need for mercy and to bring compassion to others. The book ends with Stevenson’s renewed commitment to helping others."
Reign,"King Hrothgar of Denmark, a descendant of the great king Shield Sheafson, enjoys a prosperous and successful reign. He builds a great mead-hall, called Heorot, where his warriors can gather to drink, receive gifts from their lord, and listen to stories sung by the scops, or bards. But the jubilant noise from Heorot angers Grendel, a horrible demon who lives in the swamplands of Hrothgar’s kingdom. Grendel terrorizes the Danes every night, killing them and defeating their efforts to fight back. The Danes suffer many years of fear, danger, and death at the hands of Grendel. Eventually, however, a young Geatish warrior named Beowulf hears of Hrothgar’s plight. Inspired by the challenge, Beowulf sails to Denmark with a small company of men, determined to defeat Grendel.
Hrothgar, who had once done a great favor for Beowulf’s father Ecgtheow, accepts Beowulf’s offer to fight Grendel and holds a feast in the hero’s honor. During the feast, an envious Dane named Unferth taunts Beowulf and accuses him of being unworthy of his reputation. Beowulf responds with a boastful description of some of his past accomplishments. His confidence cheers the Danish warriors, and the feast lasts merrily into the night. At last, however, Grendel arrives. Beowulf fights him unarmed, proving himself stronger than the demon, who is terrified. As Grendel struggles to escape, Beowulf tears the monster’s arm off. Mortally wounded, Grendel slinks back into the swamp to die. The severed arm is hung high in the mead-hall as a trophy of victory.
Overjoyed, Hrothgar showers Beowulf with gifts and treasure at a feast in his honor. Songs are sung in praise of Beowulf, and the celebration lasts late into the night. But another threat is approaching. Grendel’s mother, a swamp-hag who lives in a desolate lake, comes to Heorot seeking revenge for her son’s death. She murders Aeschere, one of Hrothgar’s most trusted advisers, before slinking away. To avenge Aeschere’s death, the company travels to the murky swamp, where Beowulf dives into the water and fights Grendel’s mother in her underwater lair. He kills her with a sword forged for a giant, then, finding Grendel’s corpse, decapitates it and brings the head as a prize to Hrothgar. The Danish countryside is now purged of its treacherous monsters.
The Danes are again overjoyed, and Beowulf’s fame spreads across the kingdom. Beowulf departs after a sorrowful goodbye to Hrothgar, who has treated him like a son. He returns to Geatland, where he and his men are reunited with their king and queen, Hygelac and Hygd, to whom Beowulf recounts his adventures in Denmark. Beowulf then hands over most of his treasure to Hygelac, who, in turn, rewards him.
In time, Hygelac is killed in a war against the Shyflings, and, after Hygelac’s son dies, Beowulf ascends to the throne of the Geats. He rules wisely for fifty years, bringing prosperity to Geatland. When Beowulf is an old man, however, a thief disturbs a barrow, or mound, where a great dragon lies guarding a horde of treasure. Enraged, the dragon emerges from the barrow and begins unleashing fiery destruction upon the Geats. Sensing his own death approaching, Beowulf goes to fight the dragon. With the aid of Wiglaf, he succeeds in killing the beast, but at a heavy cost. The dragon bites Beowulf in the neck, and its fiery venom kills him moments after their encounter. The Geats fear that their enemies will attack them now that Beowulf is dead. According to Beowulf’s wishes, they burn their departed king’s body on a huge funeral pyre and then bury him with a massive treasure in a barrow overlooking the sea."
Impartially,"The Joy Luck Club contains sixteen interwoven stories about conflicts between Chinese immigrant mothers and their American-raised daughters. The book hinges on Jing-mei’s trip to China to meet her half-sisters, twins Chwun Yu and Chwun Hwa. The half-sisters remained behind in China because Jing-mei’s mother, Suyuan, was forced to leave them on the roadside during her desperate flight from Japan’s invasion of Kweilin during World War II. Jing-mei was born to a different father years later, in America. Suyuan intended to return to China for her other daughters, but failed to find them before her death.
Jing-mei has taken her mother’s place playing mahjong in a weekly gathering her mother had organized in China and revived in San Francisco: the Joy Luck Club. The club’s other members—Lindo, Ying-ying, and An-mei—are three of her mother’s oldest friends and fellow immigrants. They tell Jing-mei that just before Suyuan died, she had finally succeeded in locating the address of her lost daughters. The three women repeatedly urge Jing-mei to travel to China and tell her sisters about their mother’s life. But Jing-mei wonders whether she is capable of telling her mother’s story, and the three older women fear that Jing-mei’s doubts may be justified. They fear that their own daughters, like Jing-mei, may not know or appreciate the stories of their mothers’ lives.
The novel is composed of four sections, each of which contains four separate narratives. In the first four stories of the book, the mothers, speaking in turn, recall with astonishing clarity their relationships with their own mothers, and they worry that their daughters’ recollections of them will never possess the same intensity. In the second section, these daughters—Waverly, Jing-mei, Lena, and Rose—relate their recollections of their childhood relationships with their mothers; the great lucidity and force with which they tell their stories proves their mothers’ fears at least partially unfounded. In the third group of stories, the four daughters narrate their adult dilemmas—troubles in marriage and with their careers. Although they believe that their mothers’ antiquated ideas do not pertain to their own very American lifestyles, their search for solutions inevitably brings them back to their relationships with the older generation. In the final group of stories, the mothers struggle to offer solutions and support to their daughters, in the process learning more about themselves. Lindo recognizes through her daughter Waverly that she has been irrevocably changed by American culture. Ying-ying realizes that Lena has unwittingly followed her passive example in her marriage to Harold Livotny. An-mei realizes that Rose has not completely understood the lessons she intended to teach her about faith and hope.
Although Jing-mei fears that she cannot adequately portray her mother’s life, Suyuan’s story permeates the novel via Jing-mei’s voice: she speaks for Suyuan in the first and fourth sections, the two “mothers’ sections,” of the novel. Suyuan’s story is representative of the struggle to maintain the mother-daughter bond across cultural and generational gaps; by telling this story as her mother’s daughter, Jing-mei enacts and cements the very bond that is the subject of Suyuan’s story. When Jing-mei finally travels to China and helps her half-sisters to know a mother they cannot remember, she forges two other mother-daughter bonds as well. Her journey represents a reconciliation between Suyuan’s two lives, between two cultures, and between mother and daughter. This enables Jing-mei to bring closure and resolution to her mother’s story, but also to her own. In addition, the journey brings hope to the other members of the Joy Luck Club that they too can reconcile the oppositions in their lives between past and present, between cultures, and between generations."
Solicitation,"The setting is the last decade of the eighteenth century. The British naval warship H.M.S. Bellipotent impresses, or involuntarily recruits, the young sailor Billy Budd, extracting him from duty aboard the Rights-of-Man, a merchant ship. Billy’s commanding officer, Captain Graveling, though reluctant to let one of his best men go, has little choice in the face of the superior ship’s demands. Billy packs up his gear without so much as a protest and follows the boarding officer of the Bellipotent, Lieutenant Ratcliffe, across the gangway to his new assignment. After a cheery good-bye to his old mates, Billy settles in quickly among the company of the Bellipotent. He proves most industrious and eager in his role as foretopman and soon earns the affection of his more experienced fellow sailors.
	Billy is deeply affected by the sight of a violent lashing given to one of the ship’s crew. Hoping to avoid a similar punishment, Billy attempts to fulfill his duties in model fashion, but finds himself under constant scrutiny due to various minor infractions. Puzzled by this persecution, Billy seeks out the advice of the Dansker, an aged, experienced sailor. After explaining the situation to him, the Dansker concludes that Claggart, the master-at-arms, holds a grudge against Billy. Refusing to accept this theory, Billy dismisses the Dansker’s opinion but continues to wonder pensively about his situation.
	Shortly thereafter, at a lunchtime meal, Billy accidentally spills his soup pan in the ship’s dining room after a sudden lurch. The contents of the pan trickle to the feet of the passing Claggart, who makes an offhand, seemingly lighthearted remark in recognition of the spill. His comment elicits a stream of obligatory laughter from the ship’s company, and Billy interprets the event as proof of Claggart’s approval. But Claggart is offended by the accident, and finds it indicative of Billy’s contempt for him. He fixates on the accident as proof of Billy’s hostility, and his assistant Squeak resolves to increase his surreptitious persecutions of Billy in recompense.
	One night, an anonymous figure rouses Billy from his sleep on the upper deck and asks him to meet in a remote quarter of the ship. Confused, Billy mechanically obeys. At the mysterious rendezvous, Billy is puzzled when, after some vague discourse, the unidentified man flashes two guineas in exchange for a promise of cooperation. Without comprehending the exact details of this solicitation, Billy recognizes that something is amiss, and he raises his stuttering voice and threatens the man with uncharacteristic violence. The conspirator quickly slinks into the darkness, and Billy finds himself confronted with the curious inquiries of two fellow sailors. Unsure of how to explain the situation, Billy explains that he simply happened upon a fellow sailor who was in the wrong part of the ship, and chased the man back to his proper station with a gruff rebuke.
	Somewhat later, after a brief skirmish with an enemy frigate, Claggart approaches Captain Vere with news of a rumored mutiny and names Billy Budd as the ringleader of the rebellion. Vere summons Billy to his cabin and instructs Claggart to repeat his accusation. Upon hearing of this unexpected blot on his character, Billy is rendered speechless. Vere commands Billy to defend himself, but then, noticing Billy’s tendency to stutter, softens his approach. Left with no other means of defense, and twisted into a rage at Claggart’s outrageous words against him, Billy strikes out in a fury, giving Claggart a swift punch to the forehead.
	The blow proves forceful enough to knock Claggart unconscious, and he lies bleeding from the nose and ears as Billy and Vere attempt to revive him. Abandoning this effort, Vere dismisses Billy to a neighboring stateroom until further notice. The ship’s surgeon pronounces Claggart dead after a brief examination, and Captain Vere summons a group of his senior officers to the cabin.
	In a decisive move, Vere calls a drumhead court consisting of the captain of the marines, the first lieutenant, and the sailing master. Vere, functioning as the main witness, gives a testimony of the relevant events to the jury. Billy remains rather silent during his period of questioning, admitting to the blow but maintaining his innocence of intention and declaring his lack of affiliation with any potential mutiny. The court dismisses Billy again to the stateroom.
	During a tense period of deliberation, Vere hovers over the jury. When they seem to be deadlocked, unable to make a decision, Vere steps forward to declare his conviction that the rule of law must supersede the reservations of conscience. He concludes his speech to the jury by insisting that they decide to acquit or condemn in strict accordance with the letter of military law. After a period of further deliberation, the jury finds Billy Budd guilty as charged and sentences him to death by hanging on the following morning.
	Captain Vere communicates to Billy the news of his fate and, after a discussion with him that we do not learn about directly, he withdraws to leave the prisoner by himself. Later that evening, Vere calls a general meeting of the ship’s crew and explains the events of the day. Claggart receives an official burial at sea, and all hands prepare to bear witness to Billy’s hanging at dawn.
	Billy spends his final hours in chains on board an upper gun deck, guarded by a sentry. The ship’s chaplain attempts to spiritually prepare Billy for his death, but Billy already seems to be in a state of perfect peace and resignation. As the chaplain withdraws from Billy’s company, he kisses him gently on the cheek as a token of good will.
	That morning, shortly after four A.M., Billy is hanged in the mainyard of the ship. As the crew watches him being strung up, preparing to die, they hear him utter his last words: “God bless Captain Vere!” The assembled company automatically echoes this unexpected sentiment, and Billy expires with surprising calm as dawn breaks over the horizon.
	After Billy’s death, the crew begins to murmur, but the officers quickly disperse them to various tasks. Whistles blow and the ship returns to regular business. In the ensuing days, sailors engage in various discussions concerning Billy’s fate and the mysterious circumstances of his expiration. On its return voyage, the Bellipotent falls in with a French warship, the Athée, or Atheist. Captain Vere, wounded in the skirmish, eventually dies in a Gibraltar hospital, uttering as his last words, “Billy Budd, Billy Budd.”
	Finally, the legend of Billy Budd becomes recorded and institutionalized in naval circles. A newspaper reports the incident from afar, implicating Billy Budd as the villainous assailant of an innocent Claggart. The sailors themselves, however, begin to revere Billy’s growing legend, treating the spar from his gallows as a holy object, and composing laudatory verse in his memory."
Ranks,"The convict Jean Valjean is released from a French prison after serving nineteen years for stealing a loaf of bread and for subsequent attempts to escape from prison. When Valjean arrives at the town of Digne, no one is willing to give him shelter because he is an ex-convict. Desperate, Valjean knocks on the door of M. Myriel, the kindly bishop of Digne. Myriel treats Valjean with kindness, and Valjean repays the bishop by stealing his silverware. When the police arrest Valjean, Myriel covers for him, claiming that the silverware was a gift. The authorities release Valjean and Myriel makes him promise to become an honest man. Eager to fulfill his promise, Valjean masks his identity and enters the town of Montreuil-sur-mer. Under the assumed name of Madeleine, Valjean invents an ingenious manufacturing process that brings the town prosperity. He eventually becomes the town’s mayor.
Fantine, a young woman from Montreuil, lives in Paris. She falls in love with Tholomyès, a wealthy student who gets her pregnant and then abandons her. Fantine returns to her home village with her daughter, Cosette. On the way to Montreuil, however, Fantine realizes that she will never be able to find work if the townspeople know that she has an illegitimate child. In the town of Montfermeil, she meets the Thénardiers, a family that runs the local inn. The Thénardiers agree to look after Cosette as long as Fantine sends them a monthly allowance.
In Montreuil, Fantine finds work in Madeleine’s factory. Fantine’s coworkers find out about Cosette, however, and Fantine is fired. The Thénardiers demand more money to support Cosette, and Fantine resorts to prostitution to make ends meet. One night, Javert, Montreuil’s police chief, arrests Fantine. She is to be sent to prison, but Madeleine intervenes. Fantine has fallen ill, and when she longs to see Cosette, Madeleine promises to send for her. First, however, he must contend with Javert, who has discovered Madeleine’s criminal past. Javert tells Madeleine that a man has been accused of being Jean Valjean, and Madeleine confesses his true identity. Javert shows up to arrest Valjean while Valjean is at Fantine’s bedside, and Fantine dies from the shock.
After a few years, Valjean escapes from prison and heads to Montfermeil, where he is able to buy Cosette from the Thénardiers. The Thénardiers turn out to be a family of scoundrels who abuse Cosette while spoiling their own two daughters, Eponine and Azelma. Valjean and Cosette move to a run-down part of Paris. Javert discovers their hideout, however, and they are forced to flee. They find refuge in a convent, where Cosette attends school and Valjean works as a gardener.
Marius Pontmercy is a young man who lives with his wealthy grandfather, M. Gillenormand. Because of political differences within the family, Marius has never met his father, Georges Pontmercy. After his father dies, however, Marius learns more about him and comes to admire his father’s democratic politics. Angry with his grandfather, Marius moves out of Gillenormand’s house and lives as a poor young law student. While in law school, Marius associates with a group of radical students, the Friends of the ABC, who are led by the charismatic Enjolras. One day, Marius sees Cosette at a public park. It is love at first sight, but the protective Valjean does his utmost to prevent Cosette and Marius from ever meeting. Their paths cross once again, however, when Valjean makes a charitable visit to Marius’s poor neighbors, the Jondrettes. The Jondrettes are in fact the Thénardiers, who have lost their inn and moved to Paris under an assumed name. After Valjean leaves, Thénardier announces a plan to rob Valjean when he returns. Alarmed, Marius alerts the local police inspector, who turns out to be Javert. The ambush is foiled and the Thénardiers are arrested, but Valjean escapes before Javert can identify him.
Thénardier’s daughter Eponine, who is in love with Marius, helps Marius discover Cosette’s whereabouts. Marius is finally able to make contact with Cosette, and the two declare their love for each other. Valjean, however, soon shatters their happiness. Worried that he will lose Cosette and unnerved by political unrest in the city, Valjean announces that he and Cosette are moving to England. In desperation, Marius runs to his grandfather, M. Gillenormand, to ask for M. Gillenormand’s permission to marry Cosette. Their meeting ends in a bitter argument. When Marius returns to Cosette, she and Valjean have disappeared. Heartbroken, Marius decides to join his radical student friends, who have started a political uprising. Armed with two pistols, Marius heads for the barricades.
The uprising seems doomed, but Marius and his fellow students nonetheless stand their ground and vow to fight for freedom and democracy. The students discover Javert among their ranks, and, realizing that he is a spy, Enjolras ties him up. As the army launches its first attack against the students, Eponine throws herself in front of a rifle to save Marius’s life. As Eponine dies in Marius’s arms, she hands him a letter from Cosette. Marius quickly scribbles a reply and orders a boy, Gavroche, to deliver it to Cosette.
Valjean manages to intercept the note and sets out to save the life of the man his daughter loves. Valjean arrives at the barricade and volunteers to execute Javert. When alone with Javert, however, Valjean instead secretly lets him go free. As the army storms the barricade, Valjean grabs the wounded Marius and flees through the sewers. When Valjean emerges hours later, Javert immediately arrests him. Valjean pleads with Javert to let him take the dying Marius to Marius’s grandfather. Javert agrees. Javert feels tormented, torn between his duty to his profession and the debt he owes Valjean for saving his life. Ultimately, Javert lets Valjean go and throws himself into the river, where he drowns.
Marius makes a full recovery and is reconciled with Gillenormand, who consents to Marius and Cosette’s marriage. Their wedding is a happy one, marred only when Valjean confesses his criminal past to Marius. Alarmed by this revelation and unaware that it was Valjean who saved his life at the barricades, Marius tries to prevent Cosette from having contact with Valjean. Lonely and depressed, Valjean takes to his bed and awaits his death. Marius eventually finds out from Thénardier that Valjean saved Marius’s life. Ashamed that he mistrusted Valjean, Marius tells Cosette everything that has happened. Marius and Cosette rush to Valjean’s side just in time for a final reconciliation. Happy to be reunited with his adopted daughter, Valjean dies in peace."
Invoking,"Speak, by Laurie Halse Anderson, chronicles the struggles of thirteen-year-old Melinda Sordino after she is a raped by at a party the summer before her freshman year of high school by another student. Melinda tells her story in first person narrative. She describes events within the framework of the four marking periods of the school year.
In the opening part of Speak, “First Marking Period,” Melinda begins high school, and we learn that former friends now hate her. She experiences humiliation in the cafeteria and Mr. Neck, a social studies teacher, further embarrasses her by giving her demerits on the first day of school. Ostracized by her former friends, she befriends Heather, a new girl at the school. Heather seeks popularity, and she badgers Melinda to join various clubs. Rachel, Melinda’s ex-best friend, hasn’t tried to find out the truth about what really happened to Melinda that night at the party over the summer.
Melinda describes her classes, activities, and thoughts. Her project in Mr. Freeman’s art class is to create a work of art based on a “tree,” which is the object named on the piece of paper she randomly chooses. In biology, Melinda thinks that David Petrakis, her lab partner, might be cute without the braces. And in algebra, when Mr. Stetman has Rachel come to the board to help Melinda with a problem, Melinda is humiliated. 
Melinda often skips class using stolen late passes and doesn’t complete her homework. She finds refuge at school in a vacant janitor’s closet, which she turns into her “burrow.” At the Homecoming Rally, students bully her for being the one who called the cops that night at the party.
At home, Melinda and her parents communicate with each other by leaving notes on the refrigerator. In her bedroom, she no longer wants to look in the mirror and puts it in the back of her closet. Toward the end of the marking period, Melinda’s parents hear from the school about her missing work, and she remains silent while they berate her for failing. Through it all, Melinda sees “IT” everywhere, the nightmare from which she cannot awaken.
In “Second Marking Period,” school is a grind for Melinda. At her parents’ insistence, she stays after to finish her homework, but she goes to her burrow and naps instead. In social studies, David Petrakis stands up against Mr. Neck’s racist rant about immigration. In biology, she finds that a seed within the apple she has cut is already growing. Heather gives her an early Christmas present, and Melinda decides she’ll give Heather a friendship necklace. 
On Christmas, Melinda nearly tells her parents what happened that night last summer but can’t. Winter break is miserable. Her parents keep her busy working for them, and she is relieved when school starts again. 
In gym class, Melinda impresses the basketball coaches with skills but has no interest in being on the team. She reluctantly helps Heather in her attempts to become an initiated member of a do-good club. And in biology, when she and David dissect a frog, she faints when preparing to slice it open. 
Melinda’s parents receive another call from the guidance counselor about her grades. After their verbal assault, Melinda goes to her room and uses an open paper clip to scrape at her wrist. 
“IT”, who we learn is Andy Evans, harasses Melinda in the cafeteria, and she runs to the bathroom to vomit. She has yet to tell anyone, even the reader, about what happened that summer night.
In “Third Marking Period,” Melinda continues to skip school and avoid Andy Evans. Heather ends their friendship suddenly, and later returns the friendship necklace Melinda had given her for Christmas. No one, Melinda is sure, “would like the inside girl I think I am.” 
The school counselors hold another meeting with Melinda’s parents, who berate and threaten her. She refuses to talk or defend herself. She receives In-School Suspension, and IT is there. He sits next to her and blows in her ear when Mr. Neck isn’t looking. 
In art class, Mr. Freeman gives Melinda a book about Picasso to help her “paralyzed” imagination. Picasso’s art inspires her, and she begins to draw. Mr. Freeman recognizes that she has a lot to say.
Melinda works to meet the expectations set for her. Yet, with “no friends in the known universe,” Melinda sits alone at lunch, wondering if everyone is talking and laughing about her. 
One afternoon, after a basketball game, David Petrakis invites her to his house for pizza to celebrate the team’s one-point win. She declines, torn between getting a life, and the fact that the world is a dangerous place.
At last, Melinda reveals that she was attacked at a party last summer, though she does not use the word “rape.” At this point, we (the readers) are the only ones besides Melinda who know what happened.
In “Fourth Marking Period,” Melinda takes her ex-friend Ivy’s advice and tries drawing a tree instead of carving one from linoleum block. She also learns that Rachel is dating Andy Evans. Compelled to do something, she writes a note to Rachel warning her about Andy. In the note, she admits for the first time (but without divulging her identity), that she was raped. 
Springtime arrives, and Melinda finds solace working in the garden. She and David plan a protest in social studies class over an oral report she is supposed to present, and she stands up to Heather by refusing to help her decorate for the Senior Prom. She writes on a stall in the bathroom, “Guys to Stay Away From: Andy Evans.” Andy Evans continues to bully her. 
Melinda feels compelled to tell Rachel the truth about Andy and what happened that night. But, when Rachel learns that Andy Evans was Melinda’s attacker, she accuses Melinda of being jealous and calls her a “twisted little freak.” Later, Ivy brings Melinda into the bathroom stall. Other girls have added words like “creep” and “bastard” under Andy Evan’s name. Seeing that, Melinda feels like she can fly.
Melinda realizes she doesn’t need her burrow anymore. When she is clearing her items out of the closet, Andy Evans barges in, attacks Melinda, and tries to rape her again. She finds her voice and screams “NNNOOO!!” He does not back off, so Melinda breaks a mirror, takes a shard of glass, and holds it to his neck. “I said no,” she tells him. People who had heard her scream run for help.
With hours left in the school year, Melinda finds herself a sort of hero. She finishes her tree project, receiving an A+ from Mr. Freeman."
Decline,"In “moon,” the first of the four parts of feed, an American teenager named Titus travels to the lunar surface with his high-school friends for spring break, hoping to escape the boredom they feel on Earth. No specific date is revealed, though it’s sometime in a dystopic future, where the moon is fully commercialized and people suffer from red sores called lesions. As Titus and his fellow upper-class friends Link, Marty, Calista, Loga, and Quendy arrive on the moon, readers also get their first glimpse of “the feed.” Although Titus doesn’t initially reveal exact details about the feed or how it works, he says it sends the friends ads and images for where to stay and shop. 
After failing to get into college-age parties, the group visits the Ricochet Lounge, where Titus becomes infatuated with a girl named Violet. She is beautiful and, he soon finds, visiting the moon by herself and is very unlike his friends: She doesn’t make pointless purchases at a mall they all soon visit and isn’t interested in malfunctioning, or falling into a drug-like stupor, via their connections to the feed. Later, when they all visit a dance club called the Rumble Spot, an old man from a dissenter group called the Coalition of Pity hacks into people’s individual feeds, causing them to broadcast the signal, “we enter a time of calamity” over the feed’s network. Police beat the man and “shut off” those hacked, including Titus and Violet, who hold hands as they collapse.
Part 2, “eden,” occurs in a lunar hospital where Violet, Titus, and his friends remain disconnected from the feed until their systems can be scanned for viruses. There, Titus provides additional details about what the feed is and how it works. Feeds are implanted inside the body and connect to a global network that provides news, entertainment, and a means to purchase every kind of product, he says while singing its praises. The feed even anticipates and creates users’ wants from individual profiles based on purchasing decisions, thoughts, and feelings. Titus and Violet grow closer during the stay. Violet, who’s home-schooled and smarter than Titus and his friends, says she hoped to enjoy herself like normal kids but now has a problem, though she remains vague about what this problem is. When doctors finally restore the friends’ feeds, they rejoice. Promotions begin to flow through their minds again, though there’s also ominous news concerning protests over America’s annexation of the moon and resulting anger from a group called the Global Alliance. Still, Titus says, the friends exalt in the return of their feeds.
In Part 3, “Utopia,” Titus and his friends return to Earth and life returns to normal for them: “upcars” travel in tubes past vertically stacked suburbs, the friends party, and U.S. President Trumbull scoffs at reports that claim toxic industries cause lesions. In defiance of rampant consumerism and a loss of individuality, Violet determines to resist the feed by creating a completely random customer profile and asks Titus to join her. Violet, who didn’t receive her feed until she was seven, voices deep concern about the decline of the world and destruction of Earth, and laments how those who’ve had the feed their entire lives are ignorant and self-centered. Titus soon has nightmares that are more likely hacks from the Coalition of Pity. In them, he sees disturbing images of eco destruction and human suffering around the world, but after Violet chats him, saying she has seen the images too, he only wants to go back to sleep.
Before long, Violet’s problem becomes clear: Her body begins to fail and she’s told by doctors that the damage to her feedware can be fatal. The prognosis makes Violet realize how much she wants to do. She starts by going to the seashore with Titus, though they need to dress in protective suits due to its toxicity. Meanwhile, feed chatter reveals that all of Earth’s forests have fallen and there is a growing rift between the U.S. and the Global Alliance. At a party where Quendy shows off her artificial lesions, Violet becomes outraged and her body falters. She chastises Titus and his friends for living in ignorance as the world dies, then collapses and is brought to the hospital. 
Violet’s condition declines further in Part 4, “slumberland,” whose chapter titles track her feed efficiency from a high of 87.3 percent to a low of 4.6 percent, 98 percent being optimal. Aware that she doesn’t have much time, Violet messages Titus a list of twenty-two things she wants to do in life, though he grows increasingly distant, and doesn’t message back. When they do reconnect, Violet sends Titus a recent memory where she falls down a staircase and receives a response from the corporation FeedTech, denying her petition to pay for her system repairs because she wasn’t deemed to be worthy due to her random customer profile. Violet later sends Titus childhood memories to preserve her history, though he deletes them. And when Violet convinces him to visit the mountains with her, one of her life goals, Titus breaks up with her, saying he was only interested in a short relationship while she wanted something eternal. 
Time passes and Titus eventually hears from Violet’s father. At Violet’s home, Titus sees her lying on a floating bed, completely pale, fully incapacitated, and covered in discs. Her father details her final, painful days and how her body failed. He then berates Titus for how badly he treated Violet and for willfully living in ignorance. Titus later visits Violet’s home a second time. Although she appears dead, her feed efficiency is at 4.6 percent and a screen shows that her heart is beating slightly. Nevertheless, Titus tells Violet a story he plans to keep telling her, he says, so she will remember herself. The story is about Violet, the end of America, and their relationship, where they learn something important about love and how to resist the feed. The book ends with a promotion on the feed for Blue-Jean Warehouse’s Final Sales Event and a recurring, fading message that “Everything must go.”"
Usefulness,"Jack Worthing, the play’s protagonist, is a pillar of the community in Hertfordshire, where he is guardian to Cecily Cardew, the pretty, eighteen-year-old granddaughter of the late Thomas Cardew, who found and adopted Jack when he was a baby. In Hertfordshire, Jack has responsibilities: he is a major landowner and justice of the peace, with tenants, farmers, and a number of servants and other employees all dependent on him. For years, he has also pretended to have an irresponsible black-sheep brother named Ernest who leads a scandalous life in pursuit of pleasure and is always getting into trouble of a sort that requires Jack to rush grimly off to his assistance. In fact, Ernest is merely Jack’s alibi, a phantom that allows him to disappear for days at a time and do as he likes. No one but Jack knows that he himself is Ernest. Ernest is the name Jack goes by in London, which is where he really goes on these occasions—probably to pursue the very sort of behavior he pretends to disapprove of in his imaginary brother.
Jack is in love with Gwendolen Fairfax, the cousin of his best friend, Algernon Moncrieff. When the play opens, Algernon, who knows Jack as Ernest, has begun to suspect something, having found an inscription inside Jack’s cigarette case addressed to “Uncle Jack” from someone who refers to herself as “little Cecily.” Algernon suspects that Jack may be leading a double life, a practice he seems to regard as commonplace and indispensable to modern life. He calls a person who leads a double life a “Bunburyist,” after a nonexistent friend he pretends to have, a chronic invalid named Bunbury, to whose deathbed he is forever being summoned whenever he wants to get out of some tiresome social obligation.
At the beginning of Act 1, Jack drops in unexpectedly on Algernon and announces that he intends to propose to Gwendolen. Algernon confronts him with the cigarette case and forces him to come clean, demanding to know who “Jack” and “Cecily” are. Jack confesses that his name isn’t really Ernest and that Cecily is his ward, a responsibility imposed on him by his adoptive father’s will. Jack also tells Algernon about his fictional brother. Jack says he’s been thinking of killing off this fake brother, since Cecily has been showing too active an interest in him. Without meaning to, Jack describes Cecily in terms that catch Algernon’s attention and make him even more interested in her than he is already.
Gwendolen and her mother, Lady Bracknell, arrive, which gives Jack an opportunity to propose to Gwendolen. Jack is delighted to discover that Gwendolen returns his affections, but he is alarmed to learn that Gwendolen is fixated on the name Ernest, which she says “inspires absolute confidence.” Gwendolen makes clear that she would not consider marrying a man who was not named Ernest.
Lady Bracknell interviews Jack to determine his eligibility as a possible son-in-law, and during this interview she asks about his family background. When Jack explains that he has no idea who his parents were and that he was found, by the man who adopted him, in a handbag in the cloakroom at Victoria Station, Lady Bracknell is scandalized. She forbids the match between Jack and Gwendolen and sweeps out of the house.
In Act 2, Algernon shows up at Jack’s country estate posing as Jack’s brother Ernest. Meanwhile, Jack, having decided that Ernest has outlived his usefulness, arrives home in deep mourning, full of a story about Ernest having died suddenly in Paris. He is enraged to find Algernon there masquerading as Ernest but has to go along with the charade. If he doesn’t, his own lies and deceptions will be revealed.
While Jack changes out of his mourning clothes, Algernon, who has fallen hopelessly in love with Cecily, asks her to marry him. He is surprised to discover that Cecily already considers that they are engaged, and he is charmed when she reveals that her fascination with “Uncle Jack’s brother” led her to invent an elaborate romance between herself and him several months ago. Algernon is less enchanted to learn that part of Cecily’s interest in him derives from the name Ernest, which, unconsciously echoing Gwendolen, she says “inspires absolute confidence.”
Algernon goes off in search of Dr. Chasuble, the local rector, to see about getting himself christened Ernest. Meanwhile, Gwendolen arrives, having decided to pay Jack an unexpected visit. Gwendolen is shown into the garden, where Cecily orders tea and attempts to play hostess. Cecily has no idea how Gwendolen figures into Jack’s life, and Gwendolen, for her part, has no idea who Cecily is. Gwendolen initially thinks Cecily is a visitor to the Manor House and is disconcerted to learn that Cecily is “Mr. Worthing’s ward.” She notes that Ernest has never mentioned having a ward, and Cecily explains that it is not Ernest Worthing who is her guardian but his brother Jack and, in fact, that she is engaged to be married to Ernest Worthing. Gwendolen points out that this is impossible as she herself is engaged to Ernest Worthing. The tea party degenerates into a war of manners.
Jack and Algernon arrive toward the climax of this confrontation, each having separately made arrangements with Dr. Chasuble to be christened Ernest later that day. Each of the young ladies points out that the other has been deceived: Cecily informs Gwendolen that her fiancé is really named Jack and Gwendolen informs Cecily that hers is really called Algernon. The two women demand to know where Jack’s brother Ernest is, since both of them are engaged to be married to him. Jack is forced to admit that he has no brother and that Ernest is a complete fiction. Both women are shocked and furious, and they retire to the house arm in arm.
Act 3 takes place in the drawing room of the Manor House, where Cecily and Gwendolen have retired. When Jack and Algernon enter from the garden, the two women confront them. Cecily asks Algernon why he pretended to be her guardian’s brother. Algernon tells her he did it in order to meet her. Gwendolen asks Jack whether he pretended to have a brother in order to come into London to see her as often as possible, and she interprets his evasive reply as an affirmation. The women are somewhat appeased but still concerned over the issue of the name. However, when Jack and Algernon tell Gwendolen and Cecily that they have both made arrangements to be christened Ernest that afternoon, all is forgiven and the two pairs of lovers embrace. At this moment, Lady Bracknell’s arrival is announced.
Lady Bracknell has followed Gwendolen from London, having bribed Gwendolen’s maid to reveal her destination. She demands to know what is going on. Gwendolen again informs Lady Bracknell of her engagement to Jack, and Lady Bracknell reiterates that a union between them is out of the question. Algernon tells Lady Bracknell of his engagement to Cecily, prompting her to inspect Cecily and inquire into her social connections, which she does in a routine and patronizing manner that infuriates Jack. He replies to all her questions with a mixture of civility and sarcasm, withholding until the last possible moment the information that Cecily is actually worth a great deal of money and stands to inherit still more when she comes of age. At this, Lady Bracknell becomes genuinely interested.
Jack informs Lady Bracknell that, as Cecily’s legal guardian, he refuses to give his consent to her union with Algernon. Lady Bracknell suggests that the two young people simply wait until Cecily comes of age, and Jack points out that under the terms of her grandfather’s will, Cecily does not legally come of age until she is thirty-five. Lady Bracknell asks Jack to reconsider, and he points out that the matter is entirely in her own hands. As soon as she consents to his marriage to Gwendolen, Cecily can have his consent to marry Algernon. However, Lady Bracknell refuses to entertain the notion. She and Gwendolen are on the point of leaving when Dr. Chasuble arrives and happens to mention Cecily’s governess, Miss Prism. At this, Lady Bracknell starts and asks that Miss Prism be sent for.
When the governess arrives and catches sight of Lady Bracknell, she begins to look guilty and furtive. Lady Bracknell accuses her of having left her sister’s house twenty-eight years before with a baby and never returned. She demands to know where the baby is. Miss Prism confesses she doesn’t know, explaining that she lost the baby, having absentmindedly placed it in a handbag in which she had meant to place the manuscript for a novel she had written. Jack asks what happened to the bag, and Miss Prism says she left it in the cloakroom of a railway station. Jack presses her for further details and goes racing offstage, returning a few moments later with a large handbag. When Miss Prism confirms that the bag is hers, Jack throws himself on her with a cry of “Mother!” It takes a while before the situation is sorted out, but before too long we understand that Jack is not the illegitimate child of Miss Prism but the legitimate child of Lady Bracknell’s sister and, therefore, Algernon’s older brother. Furthermore, Jack had been originally christened “Ernest John.” All these years Jack has unwittingly been telling the truth: Ernest is his name, as is Jack, and he does have an unprincipled younger brother—Algernon. Again the couples embrace, Miss Prism and Dr. Chasuble follow suit, and Jack acknowledges that he now understands “the vital Importance of Being Earnest.”"
Supplying,"Anne’s diary begins on her thirteenth birthday, June 12, 1942, and ends shortly after her fifteenth. At the start of her diary, Anne describes fairly typical girlhood experiences, writing about her friendships with other girls, her crushes on boys, and her academic performance at school. Because anti-Semitic laws forced Jews into separate schools, Anne and her older sister, Margot, attended the Jewish Lyceum in Amsterdam.
	The Franks had moved to the Netherlands in the years leading up to World War II to escape persecution in Germany. After the Germans invaded the Netherlands in 1940, the Franks were forced into hiding. With another family, the van Daans, and an acquaintance, Mr. Dussel, they moved into a small secret annex above Otto Frank’s office where they had stockpiled food and supplies. The employees from Otto’s firm helped hide the Franks and kept them supplied with food, medicine, and information about the outside world.
	The residents of the annex pay close attention to every development of the war by listening to the radio. Some bits of news catch Anne’s attention and make their way into her diary, providing a vivid historical context for her personal thoughts. The adults make optimistic bets about when the war will end, and their mood is severely affected by Allied setbacks or German advances. Amsterdam is devastated by the war during the two years the Franks are in hiding. All of the city’s residents suffer, since food becomes scarce and robberies more frequent.
	Anne often writes about her feelings of isolation and loneliness. She has a tumultuous relationship with the adults in the annex, particularly her mother, whom she considers lacking in love and affection. She adores her father, but she is frequently scolded and criticized by Mr. and Mrs. van Daan and Mr. Dussel. Anne thinks that her sister, Margot, is smart, pretty, and agreeable, but she does not feel close to her and does not write much about her. Anne eventually develops a close friendship with Peter van Daan, the teenage boy in the annex. Mr. Frank does not approve, however, and the intensity of Anne’s infatuation begins to lessen.
	Anne matures considerably throughout the course of her diary entries, moving from detailed accounts of basic activities to deeper, more profound thoughts about humanity and her own personal nature. She finds it difficult to understand why the Jews are being singled out and persecuted. Anne also confronts her own identity. Though she considers herself to be German, her German citizenship has been revoked, and though she calls Holland her home, many of the Dutch have turned against the Jews. Anne feels a tremendous solidarity with her aggrieved people, and yet at the same time she wants to be seen as an individual rather than a member of a persecuted group.
During the two years recorded in her diary, Anne deals with confinement and deprivation, as well as the complicated and difficult issues of growing up in the brutal circumstances of the Holocaust. Her diary describes a struggle to define herself within this climate of oppression. Anne’s diary ends without comment on August 1, 1944, the end of a seemingly normal day that leaves us with the expectation of seeing another entry on the next page. However, the Frank family is betrayed to the Nazis and arrested on August 4, 1944. Anne’s diary, the observations of an imaginative, friendly, sometimes petty, and rather normal teenage girl, comes to an abrupt and silent end. 
Otto Frank is the family’s sole survivor, and he recovers Anne’s diary from Miep. He decides to fulfill Anne’s wishes by publishing the diary. Anne’s diary becomes a condemnation of the unimaginable horror of the Holocaust, and one of the few accounts that describe it from a young person’s perspective.
	Since Anne’s diary is a true personal account of a life in hiding, it is inappropriate to analyze it as a novel or other work of fiction. Parts of the diary were intended for public view, but others clearly were not. To appreciate and interpret the diary, it is necessary to consider its horrible context, World War II and the Holocaust, before any discussion of plot development or thematic content."
Devised,"Ten years have passed since the fall of Troy, and the Greek hero Odysseus still has not returned to his kingdom in Ithaca. A large and rowdy mob of suitors who have overrun Odysseus’s palace and pillaged his land continue to court his wife, Penelope. She has remained faithful to Odysseus. Prince Telemachus, Odysseus’s son, wants desperately to throw them out but does not have the confidence or experience to fight them. One of the suitors, Antinous, plans to assassinate the young prince, eliminating the only opposition to their dominion over the palace.
Read more about The Odyssey’s precursor, The Iliad.
Unknown to the suitors, Odysseus is still alive. The beautiful nymph Calypso, possessed by love for him, has imprisoned him on her island, Ogygia. He longs to return to his wife and son, but he has no ship or crew to help him escape. While the gods and goddesses of Mount Olympus debate Odysseus’s future, Athena, Odysseus’s strongest supporter among the gods, resolves to help Telemachus. Disguised as a friend of the prince’s grandfather, Laertes, she convinces the prince to call a meeting of the assembly at which he reproaches the suitors. Athena also prepares him for a great journey to Pylos and Sparta, where the kings Nestor and Menelaus, Odysseus’s companions during the war, inform him that Odysseus is alive and trapped on Calypso’s island. Telemachus makes plans to return home, while, back in Ithaca, Antinous and the other suitors prepare an ambush to kill him when he reaches port.
On Mount Olympus, Zeus sends Hermes to rescue Odysseus from Calypso. Hermes persuades Calypso to let Odysseus build a ship and leave. The homesick hero sets sail, but when Poseidon, god of the sea, finds him sailing home, he sends a storm to wreck Odysseus’s ship. Poseidon has harbored a bitter grudge against Odysseus since the hero blinded his son, the Cyclops Polyphemus, earlier in his travels. Athena intervenes to save Odysseus from Poseidon’s wrath, and the beleaguered king lands at Scheria, home of the Phaeacians. Nausicaa, the Phaeacian princess, shows him to the royal palace, and Odysseus receives a warm welcome from the king and queen. When he identifies himself as Odysseus, his hosts, who have heard of his exploits at Troy, are stunned. They promise to give him safe passage to Ithaca, but first they beg to hear the story of his adventures.
Odysseus spends the night describing the fantastic chain of events leading up to his arrival on Calypso’s island. He recounts his trip to the Land of the Lotus Eaters, his battle with Polyphemus the Cyclops, his love affair with the witch-goddess Circe, his temptation by the deadly Sirens, his journey into Hades to consult the prophet Tiresias, and his fight with the sea monster Scylla. When he finishes his story, the Phaeacians return Odysseus to Ithaca, where he seeks out the hut of his faithful swineherd, Eumaeus. Though Athena has disguised Odysseus as a beggar, Eumaeus warmly receives and nourishes him in the hut. He soon encounters Telemachus, who has returned from Pylos and Sparta despite the suitors’ ambush, and reveals to him his true identity. Odysseus and Telemachus devise a plan to massacre the suitors and regain control of Ithaca.
When Odysseus arrives at the palace the next day, still disguised as a beggar, he endures abuse and insults from the suitors. The only person who recognizes him is his old nurse, Eurycleia, but she swears not to disclose his secret. Penelope takes an interest in this strange beggar, suspecting that he might be her long-lost husband. Quite crafty herself, Penelope organizes an archery contest the following day and promises to marry any man who can string Odysseus’s great bow and fire an arrow through a row of twelve axes—a feat that only Odysseus has ever been able to accomplish. At the contest, each suitor tries to string the bow and fails. Odysseus steps up to the bow and, with little effort, fires an arrow through all twelve axes. He then turns the bow on the suitors. He and Telemachus, assisted by a few faithful servants, kill every last suitor.
Odysseus reveals himself to the entire palace and reunites with his loving Penelope. He travels to the outskirts of Ithaca to see his aging father, Laertes. They come under attack from the vengeful family members of the dead suitors, but Laertes, reinvigorated by his son’s return, successfully kills Antinous’s father and puts a stop to the attack. Zeus dispatches Athena to restore peace. With his power secure and his family reunited, Odysseus’s long ordeal comes to an end."
Adams,"Dinah Morris, a Methodist preacher, arrives in Hayslope, a small village in England, in 1799. She stays with her aunt and uncle, Mr. and Mrs. Poyser, although she plans to return soon to Snowfield, where she normally lives. Seth Bede, a local carpenter, loves her and is learning to live with her rejection of his marriage proposal. Seth’s brother, Adam Bede, also lives in Hayslope and works as the foreman at the carpentry shop where he and his brother work. Adam loves a seventeen-year-old village beauty named Hetty Sorrel. Hetty, who is Mr. Poyser’s niece, lives with the Poysers and helps with the chores.
Thias Bede, the father of Seth and Adam, drowns in the river near their house after a drinking binge. Their mother, Lisbeth, is distraught. Dinah goes to comfort Lisbeth, and she is able to soothe her where no one else can. Lisbeth wishes that Dinah could be her daughter-in-law.
The local landlord, Squire Donnithorne, rules the parish with an iron fist. His grandson and heir, Captain Donnithorne, who is a member of the regimental army, has broken his arm and is living with the Squire. The villagers all respect and adore Captain Donnithorne, who considers himself a gallant man. Captain Donnithorne flirts secretively with Hetty after first meeting her at the Poysers. He asks her when she will next be visiting the Squire’s residence and arranges to meet her alone in the woods when she passes through.
When Captain Donnithorne meets up with Hetty in the woods, they are alone for the first time and both are bashful. Captain Donnithorne teases Hetty about her many suitors, and she cries. He puts his arms around her, but he then immediately panics at the inappropriateness of his advances and runs off. Later Captain Donnithorne meditates on what he has done and decides he needs to see Hetty to clear up what happened. He meets her on her way back through the woods, and they kiss. This encounter begins a summer-long affair, which only ends when Captain Donnithorne leaves to rejoin his regiment. Hetty believes that Captain Donnithorne will marry her and make her into the great socialite she dreams of being. Although she does not exactly love him, she loves the wealth and privilege he represents.
Captain Donnithorne throws a coming-of-age party for himself to which he invites all the members in the parish. Everyone comes and has a wonderful time with a feast, dancing, and games. Adam discovers that Hetty is wearing a locket that Captain Donnithorne gave her. He becomes suspicious that she might have a secret lover but concludes that it would not be possible for her to conceal such a thing from the Poysers.
On the last night Captain Donnithorne is in town, Adam catches him kissing Hetty in the woods. Adam and he have a fight, which Adam wins. Captain Donnithorne lies to Adam that the affair was no more than a little flirtation. At his response, Adam tells him he must write a letter to Hetty letting her know that the affair is over. Captain Donnithorne does so, and Adam delivers the letter. Hetty is crushed, but after some time she resolves to marry Adam as a way out of her current life. Adam proposes, and Hetty accepts. By the time Captain Donnithorne leaves, Hetty is pregnant, although neither of them knows it. She resolves to go out to find Captain Donnithorne because she cannot bear to have those who know her find out about her shame. She believes that Captain Donnithorne will help her, even though she feels he can never erase her shame.
Hetty sets out to locate Captain Donnithorne. At the end of an arduous journey, she learns that he has gone to Ireland. She heads in the direction of home, more or less intending to visit Dinah, who she believes will help her without judging her. Along the way, she gives birth to her child. Distraught, she takes the child into the woods and buries it under a tree. Hetty goes away, but she cannot escape the sound of the child’s cry. She returns to where she left the baby. A farm laborer and the Stoniton constable discover her, and the constable takes her into custody for the murder of her child.
Adam is distraught when he cannot find Hetty and concludes that Captain Donnithorne must have lured her away from their upcoming marriage. Before traveling to Ireland to find him, he first goes to Mr. Irwine to inform him of his plan. Mr. Irwine tells Adam that Hetty is in jail for murder. Adam goes to her trial, even though the situation troubles him. Dinah arrives and is able to reach Hetty through her depression and convince her that she must repent to save her soul. Hetty is convicted and sentenced to die.
At the last possible moment, Captain Donnithorne arrives with a stay of execution. Hetty is transported, meaning that she is sent away from England for her crimes. She dies just before she is set to return to Hayslope. Captain Donnithorne goes away for a few years because of the shame he has brought on the Poysers and Adam. Adam realizes that he is in love with Dinah. He proposes, but she rejects him until she comes to realize that it is God’s will that she marry Adam. They are married, and they have two children. Seth lives with them and does not marry. Captain Donnithorne ultimately returns to Hayslope, and he and Adam meet one last time at the conclusion of the novel. They are able to stay friends despite all that has come between them."

Promotions begin to flow through their minds again, though there’s also ominous news concerning protests over America’s annexation of the moon and resulting anger from a group called the Global Alliance. Still, Titus says, the friends exalt in the return of their feeds.
In Part 3, “Utopia,” Titus and his friends return to Earth and life returns to normal for them: “upcars” travel in tubes past vertically stacked suburbs, the friends party, and U.S. President Trumbull scoffs at reports that claim toxic industries cause lesions. In defiance of rampant consumerism and a loss of individuality, Violet determines to resist the feed by creating a completely random customer profile and asks Titus to join her. Violet, who didn’t receive her feed until she was seven, voices deep concern about the decline of the world and destruction of Earth, and laments how those who’ve had the feed their entire lives are ignorant and self-centered. Titus soon has nightmares that are more likely hacks from the Coalition of Pity. In them, he sees disturbing images of eco destruction and human suffering around the world, but after Violet chats him, saying she has seen the images too, he only wants to go back to sleep.
Before long, Violet’s problem becomes clear: Her body begins to fail and she’s told by doctors that the damage to her feedware can be fatal. The prognosis makes Violet realize how much she wants to do. She starts by going to the seashore with Titus, though they need to dress in protective suits due to its toxicity. Meanwhile, feed chatter reveals that all of Earth’s forests have fallen and there is a growing rift between the U.S. and the Global Alliance. At a party where Quendy shows off her artificial lesions, Violet becomes outraged and her body falters. She chastises Titus and his friends for living in ignorance as the world dies, then collapses and is brought to the hospital. 
Violet’s condition declines further in Part 4, “slumberland,” whose chapter titles track her feed efficiency from a high of 87.3 percent to a low of 4.6 percent, 98 percent being optimal. Aware that she doesn’t have much time, Violet messages Titus a list of twenty-two things she wants to do in life, though he grows increasingly distant, and doesn’t message back. When they do reconnect, Violet sends Titus a recent memory where she falls down a staircase and receives a response from the corporation FeedTech, denying her petition to pay for her system repairs because she wasn’t deemed to be worthy due to her random customer profile. Violet later sends Titus childhood memories to preserve her history, though he deletes them. And when Violet convinces him to visit the mountains with her, one of her life goals, Titus breaks up with her, saying he was only interested in a short relationship while she wanted something eternal. 
Time passes and Titus eventually hears from Violet’s father. At Violet’s home, Titus sees her lying on a floating bed, completely pale, fully incapacitated, and covered in discs. Her father details her final, painful days and how her body failed. He then berates Titus for how badly he treated Violet and for willfully living in ignorance. Titus later visits Violet’s home a second time. Although she appears dead, her feed efficiency is at 4.6 percent and a screen shows that her heart is beating slightly. Nevertheless, Titus tells Violet a story he plans to keep telling her, he says, so she will remember herself. The story is about Violet, the end of America, and their relationship, where they learn something important about love and how to resist the feed. The book ends with a promotion on the feed for Blue-Jean Warehouse’s Final Sales Event and a recurring, fading message that “Everything must go.”"
Household,"Offred is a Handmaid in the Republic of Gilead, a totalitarian and theocratic state that has replaced the United States of America. Because of dangerously low reproduction rates, Handmaids are assigned to bear children for elite couples that have trouble conceiving. Offred serves the Commander and his wife, Serena Joy, a former gospel singer and advocate for “traditional values.” Offred is not the narrator’s real name—Handmaid names consist of the word “of” followed by the name of the Handmaid’s Commander. Every month, when Offred is at the right point in her menstrual cycle, she must have ritualized sex with the Commander while Serena sits behind her, holding her hands. Offred’s freedom, like the freedom of all women, is completely restricted. She can leave the house only on shopping trips, the door to her room cannot be completely shut, and the Eyes, Gilead’s secret police force, watch her every public move.
As Offred tells the story of her daily life, she frequently slips into flashbacks, from which the reader can reconstruct the events leading up to the beginning of the novel. In the old world, before Gilead, Offred had an affair with Luke, a married man. Luke divorced his wife and married Offred, and they had a child together. Offred’s mother was a single mother and feminist activist. Offred’s best friend, Moira, was fiercely independent. The architects of Gilead began their rise to power in an age of readily available pornography, prostitution, and violence against women—when pollution and chemical spills led to declining fertility rates. Using the military, they assassinated the president and members of Congress and launched a coup, claiming that they were taking power temporarily. They cracked down on women’s rights, forbidding women to hold property or jobs. Offred and Luke took their daughter and attempted to flee across the border into Canada, but they were caught and separated from one another, and Offred has seen neither her husband nor her daughter since.
After her capture, Offred’s marriage was voided (because Luke had been divorced), and she was sent to the Rachel and Leah Re-education Center, called the Red Center by its inhabitants. At the center, women were indoctrinated into Gilead’s ideology in preparation for becoming Handmaids. Aunt Lydia supervised the women, giving speeches extolling Gilead’s beliefs that women should be subservient to men and solely concerned with bearing children. Aunt Lydia also argued that such a social order ultimately offers women more respect and safety than the old, pre-Gilead society offered them. Moira is brought to the Red Center, but she escapes, and Offred does not know what becomes of her.
Once Offred is assigned to the Commander’s house, her life settles into a restrictive routine. She takes shopping trips with Ofglen, another Handmaid, and they visit the Wall outside what used to be Harvard University, where the bodies of rebels hang. She must visit the doctor frequently to be checked for disease and other complications, and she must endure the “Ceremony,” in which the Commander reads to the household from the Bible, then goes to the bedroom, where Serena and Offred wait for him, and has sex with Offred.
The first break from her routine occurs when she visits the doctor and he offers to have sex with her to get her pregnant, suggesting that her Commander is probably infertile. She refuses. The doctor makes her uneasy, but his proposition is too risky—she could be sent away if caught. After a Ceremony, the Commander sends his gardener and chauffeur, Nick, to ask Offred to come see him in his study the following night. She begins visiting him regularly. They play Scrabble (which is forbidden, since women are not allowed to read), and he lets her look at old magazines like Vogue. At the end of these secret meetings, he asks her to kiss him.
During one of their shopping trips, Ofglen reveals to Offred that she is a member of “Mayday,” an underground organization dedicated to overthrowing Gilead. Meanwhile, Offred begins to find that the Ceremony feels different and less impersonal now that she knows the Commander. Their nighttime conversations begin to touch on the new order that the Commander and his fellow leaders have created in Gilead. When Offred admits how unhappy she is, the Commander remarks, “[Y]ou can’t make an omelette without breaking eggs.”
After some time has gone by without Offred becoming pregnant, Serena suggests that Offred have sex with Nick secretly and pass the child off as the Commander’s. Serena promises to bring Offred a picture of her daughter if she sleeps with Nick, and Offred realizes with horror that Serena has always known where her daughter was. The same night that Offred is to sleep with Nick, the Commander secretly takes her out to a club called Jezebel’s, where the Commanders mingle with prostitutes. Offred sees Moira working there. The two women meet in a bathroom, and Offred learns that Moira was captured just before she crossed the border. She chose life in Jezebel’s over being sent to the Colonies, where most political prisoners and others who pose a threat to Gilead are sent. After that night at Jezebel’s, Offred says, she never sees Moira again. The Commander takes Offred upstairs after a few hours, and they have sex in what used to be a hotel room. She tries to feign passion.
Soon after Offred returns from Jezebel’s, late at night, Serena arrives and tells Offred to go to Nick’s room. Offred and Nick have sex. Soon they begin to sleep together frequently, without anyone’s knowledge. Offred becomes caught up in the affair and ignores Ofglen’s requests that she gather information from the Commander for Mayday. One day, all the Handmaids take part in a group execution of a supposed rapist, supervised by Aunt Lydia. Ofglen strikes the first blow. Later, she tells Offred that the so-called rapist was a member of Mayday and that she hit him to put him out of his misery.
Shortly thereafter, Offred goes out shopping, and a new Ofglen meets her. This new woman is not part of Mayday, and she tells Offred that the old Ofglen hanged herself when she saw the secret police coming for her. At home, Serena has found out about Offred’s trip to Jezebel’s, and she sends her to her room, promising punishment. Offred waits there, and she sees a black van from the Eyes approach. Then Nick comes in and tells her that the Eyes are really Mayday members who have come to save her. Offred leaves with them, over the Commander’s futile objections, on her way either to prison or to freedom—she does not know which.
The novel closes with an epilogue from 2195, after Gilead has fallen, written in the form of a lecture given by Professor Pieixoto. He explains the formation and customs of Gilead in objective, analytical language. He discusses the significance of Offred’s story, which has been found on cassette tapes in Bangor, Maine. Pieixoto suggests that Nick arranged Offred’s escape but that her fate after that is unknown. She could have escaped to Canada or England, or she could have been recaptured."
Induces,"Lawyer Bryan Stevenson gives a first-person account of his decades helping marginalized Americans who have been unfairly and harshly punished by the U.S. criminal justice system, which disproportionately targets people of color and poor people. At the heart of Just Mercy is the story of Walter McMillian, a Black man who was framed for the murder of a girl named Ronda Morrison, convicted, and sent to death row. 
Stevenson alternates chapters about Walter with his personal reflections on our country’s history with racial disparity and issues around incarceration. Stevenson highlights other groups of vulnerable people who have been victimized by the criminal justice system and shares the stories of the prisoners he has helped over the years. The book also follows the growth of Stevenson’s nonprofit law project, the Alabama-based Equal Justice Initiative (EJI), through its expansion from focusing on death row prisoners to helping people sentenced to life without parole. Stevenson chronicles how EJI becomes a significant force in criminal justice reform.
In 1983 as a law student, Stevenson discovers his life’s passion when he interns with the Georgia-based Southern Prisoners Defense Committee and meets his first death row prisoner. After graduation Stevenson accepts a job with the organization to represent poor prisoners, including those in Alabama who lack any public defender. He meets Walter McMillian on Alabama’s death row. Walter owns a successful business but also transgresses racial boundaries when he has an affair with a white woman. Soon after the affair becomes public, the woman’s friend, Ralph Myers, accuses Walter of committing the unsolved murder of Ronda Morrison, which has outraged the community. Law enforcement, including a racist sheriff and the district attorney, eagerly pounces on this accusation, overlooking Walter’s alibi and a lack of evidence. Instead, they actively force Ralph to stick with his story even when he tries to recant. They coerce other false witness testimonies, and—as revealed years later—actively suppress evidence.
After Stevenson and the team at EJI unsuccessfully appeal Walter’s conviction, they launch their own investigation of the crime and uncover new evidence. They find witnesses who can prove the witnesses against Walter lied as well as financial records that indicate that one of these witnesses was paid to give false testimony. Stevenson and his team also petition for and receive all records from Walter’s trial. However, their big break comes when they receive a phone call from Ralph, who now wants to make amends. Ralph admits to lying about Walter and says he was threatened by law enforcement. Stevenson wins a hearing for Walter where he can present his new evidence: Ralph’s testimony, which is confirmed by health care workers and other inmates, as well as recordings of the law enforcement team threatening Ralph if he doesn’t frame Walter. 
While the judge refuses to grant Walter relief, Stevenson continues the appeal process through the Alabama courts. The district attorney asks outside agents to investigate the murder for which Walter was convicted, and the investigators determine that Walter had nothing to do with the crime. Six weeks later, the court invalidates Walter’s conviction. Stevenson and the State file a joint motion to dismiss the charges, and Walter is set free.
Throughout the process, Stevenson and Walter become close friends, and Stevenson helps Walter upon his release, including filing a civil suit on his behalf and offering him a place to stay. Walter works with Stevenson to share his story, giving interviews and speaking at legal conferences, and Walter is even featured in a documentary. Unfortunately, Walter is diagnosed with advancing dementia and is forced to rely on family and eventually a nursing facility for his care. He dies in 2013. Stevenson gives a eulogy at his funeral and shares all he learned from Walter, particularly that we must extend mercy to everyone, even those who have not earned it.
Interspersed with chapters chronicling Walter’s narrative are stories of Stevenson’s other clients and work. His closeness with these prisoners and their horrifying circumstances makes Stevenson more determined to help and causes him to reflect on abstract issues that nevertheless imbue the criminal justice system, like humanity and mercy. Stevenson focuses on several categories of vulnerable people who become trapped in the system, including mentally ill prisoners, disabled prisoners, and poor women who give birth to stillborn babies. 
Stevenson and his team at EJI also become increasingly focused on juvenile offenders who are sometimes tried as adults despite their young age. These offenders may be given de facto death sentences by being sentenced to life without parole and face perilous circumstances when they are housed in adult prisons. Stevenson illustrates how these prisoners retain their own humanity while being forced to live under inhumane conditions. He also discusses some of the qualities common among these types of prisoners: They are generally poor and disproportionately people of color, and most of them lack adequate legal counsel. The juveniles have horrific backgrounds of abuse and neglect.
Stevenson and his team at EJI also work to change the legal system to offer more protection to marginalized people. Several of his cases end up before the U.S. Supreme Court, and he succeeds in winning rulings that ban as unconstitutional the conviction of children to life without parole and the execution of people deemed incompetent from dementia or neurological disease. EJI works to raise public awareness of issues surrounding unfair incarceration, produces groundbreaking reports on racial issues, and sets up programs to help formerly incarcerated people adjust to life on the outside.
Stevenson also reflects on the issues that surround the criminal justice system. His time spent with prisoners awaiting their execution makes him realize how inhumane it is to prepare another human to die. After decades of work, when Stevenson fails to prevent the execution of a man who suffers from an intellectual disability, he momentarily feels unable to continue his work. However, he realizes that he cannot help but be broken by his experiences and comes to understand that it is his own brokenness that allows him to more fully understand the need for mercy and to bring compassion to others. The book ends with Stevenson’s renewed commitment to helping others."
Skill,"In Outliers: The Story of Success, Malcolm Gladwell considers the circumstances that lead to success. The first half of the book looks closely at how opportunities matter more in the lives of successful people than hard work or raw talent. The second half of the book focuses on cultural legacies: behavioral tendencies rooted in their ancestral past.
Part One examines the role of opportunity in the lives of extremely successful people. Gladwell’s first example is the Canadian Hockey League, the world’s most competitive youth hockey league. Since the cutoff date for the Canadian leagues that serve the youngest players is January 1, those born in the first part of the calendar year are much larger and more coordinated than their peers. The larger and more coordinated kids are given more playing time and better coaching, and thus become better players by the time they reach the top league. An overwhelming majority of Canadian professional hockey players have birthdays in January, February or March.
Gladwell proposes that 10,000 hours of practice is needed to master a skill, even for prodigies like Mozart. Bill Joy, Bill Gates, and the Beatles all worked hard to achieve success but benefited from opportunities they did not create. Joy, one of the founders of Sun Microsystems, happened to attend one of the first colleges in the world with a time-sharing terminal. In graduate school, he had a terminal in his room, where he spent all of his free time programming. Gates happened to attend a private high school with a time-sharing terminal connected to a mainframe in Seattle. He also was able to spend all of his free time programming. Early on, the Beatles were hired to play long shows day after day in Hamburg, Germany. 
Birth year or era is another form of opportunity. Gates and Joy (as well as other early programmers) all reached the end of their teen years just as personal computers became available to the public. In another example, fourteen of the top seventy-five richest people in the history of the world happened to be alive at the same time, in the same country: the United States in the mid-1800s.
Opportunity matters more than an individual’s IQ. Using a study conducted by Lewis Terman, the creator of the Stanford-Binet IQ test, Gladwell shows that “practical intelligence” is as important as “analytical intelligence.” He also contrasts Chris Langan, one of the world’s smartest living people, with Robert Oppenheimer. While both had difficulties in college, only Oppenheimer had a successful life, due to his practical intelligence.
The last portion of Part One looks at Joe Flom, a successful lawyer from New York City. While he was born into a poor family to Jewish immigrants (in a time when Jewish immigrants were not treated well), many of the disadvantages in his life were actually benefits and directly contributed to his success.
Part Two investigates cultural legacies. Using flight recorder transcripts from several plane crashes from the last few decades, Gladwell shows that cultural expectations and habits can be a severe hindrance to pilots. Copilots from countries that have a high “Power Distance Index” (those that show the most deference to authority) will often avoid telling pilots that they are making mistakes, even when the mistakes are potentially fatal. After recognizing the dangers of such cultural expectations, commercial aviation has instituted programs to change the way flight crews talk with one another. 
Gladwell next analyzes the disparity in public school math test scores between Eastern and Western countries. He suggests that the cultures in which rice paddy farming is historically important have a stronger work ethic. Using various examples, Gladwell shows that hard work has a greater impact on success in learning mathematics than intelligence. 
The final example is an examination of the KIPP school in the South Bronx and the “achievement gap” between socioeconomic groups. American students from middle-class and affluent households retain more information over summer vacation and are more likely to make additional gains than students from low-income households. The KIPP school uses longer school days and summer programming to eliminate the achievement gap for low-income children. While the work schedule is very rigorous, the school’s students go on to great academic success.
Gladwell demonstrates that if more opportunities were available, there would be far more successful people and the world would be richer for it."
Child,"Child of the Dark, the diary of Carolina Maria de Jesus, covers the period between July 1955 and January 1, 1960, with a gap, due to editing, between 1955 and 1958. Carolina has three children: Vera (two), José Carlos (five), and João (eight). They live in a favela, or shantytown, where living spaces consist of crude huts built of cardboard and wood scraps. Her daily life consists of collecting paper and metal scraps for food money. While looking for scraps outside a football stadium, Carolina endures taunts from white patrons. Carolina often fares no better closer to home—meddlesome favela woman like Dona Rosa and Dona Silvia pick fights with Carolina’s children and try to provoke Carolina. Favelalife is full of hunger, disease, violence, and alcoholism. Carolina’s only consolation is writing and the occasional kindness of friends and strangers, such as when a man stops by the favela and gives Carolina’s daughter, Vera, one hundred cruzieros, the equivalent of what Carolina often earns in a day.
Carolina struggles to insulate her children from bad influences, but she receives several summons from the police station regarding her boys’ behavior. After a few visits there, and after a neighbor woman, Chica, levels an accusation of rape against João, Carolina briefly considers interning her children in a public shelter for their own safety and wellbeing. Carolina believes that João’s accuser is lying, but she worries that her children are in danger while the matter is being investigated. After two runaways from the shelter seek refuge in Carolina’s home, and she hears their stories of horrible abuse, she changes her mind about putting her children there, recognizing that the experience would likely turn them into criminals. The fact that the favelachanges everyone it touches is a reality that Carolina fully understands. As she observes a new resident become increasingly argumentative and desperate as they adapt to the “dog-eat-dog” mentality that rules the favela, Carolina recognizes that a person can resist being dragged down by it only for so long.
Carolina takes every opportunity she can get to participate in Brazil’s political system, but after going to Congress to observe her leaders, she feels nothing but disgust. In response to the ignorance she sees from those in power, Carolina levels many critiques against the political system that she believes contributes to the poverty and hunger of the favelados. To Carolina, Brazil’s President Juscelino is a bird in a cage, and the favela dwellers are hungry cats that may someday rise up against him if given the chance. On a more day-to-day level, Carolina senses that she lives in a system that conspires against the poor. Inflation is rampant, and prices for basic necessities, such as rice and flour, can be absurd. When Carolina watches a factory owner dump rotted food near the favela, she considers it an act of blatant cruelty. Carolina also endures racial and class discrimination every time she ventures out of the favelaand into the city of São Paulo. While taking a streetcar, Carolina discusses the politician Dr. Adhemar with other passengers, who blame him for the steep increases in the cost of transportation. Carolina thinks that Adehemar is angry and wants to punish the poor. In the often-brutal world she lives in, Carolina wonders how much worse conditions can get.
Carolina refuses to put her interest in marrying before her interest in her children, even when she is proposed to by a man named Manuel, who, compared to the other favelados, is fairly well off, a worker and abstainer from alcohol. Against her own better judgment, Carolina also becomes intertwined with a gypsy named Raimundo, who awakens in her a sense of romance and adventure. Ultimately, she decides that he is not the man she thought he was, but when he moves away, she is sick and broken-hearted. Through both entanglements, Carolina maintains that she is not the marrying type, her children come first, and she is unwilling to make the sacrifices that she sees other women making in order to get married.
The intervention of a journalist named Audalio Dantas helps Carolina to realize her dream of being published. When excerpts of her diary appear in a weekly magazine called O Cruziero,Carolina tells everyone she can about her new fame. Unfortunately, being published does not have the effect that she was hoping for. Not only do Carolina’s dire daily circumstances remain unchanged, but she quickly finds success to be a bitter pill when the favela fills with disparaging talk of her motives. Even after her publication, Carolina must deal with the same challenges and frustrations: the struggle to scrape together enough money for food, the lines at the water spigot, the fights, and the racism and sexism she faces on a daily basis. Despite these daily humiliations, Carolina holds fast to her dream of finding a home far from the favela for her family."
Watchman,"Jean Louise Finch arrives in Maycomb, Alabama, traveling from New York City for her annual two-week visit home. Jean Louise’s father, Atticus Finch, is a prominent lawyer in town. Over the past few years, he has been suffering from arthritis, so his sister, Alexandra Finch, now lives with him. Jean Louise’s older brother, Jem, died of a sudden heart condition a few years ago when he was only in his early twenties.
Jean Louise reconnects with Henry “Hank” Clinton, who works in Atticus’s law office. Henry was Jem’s childhood best friend, and he and Jean Louise have been a couple for several years, but Jean Louise won’t commit to marrying him. Henry and Jean Louise visit Jean Louise’s ancestral home, where they go swimming late at night. Jean Louise has flashbacks to her childhood with Jem and her childhood friend, Dill. She fondly remembers re-enacting scenes from both fiction and reality with them. On the way back to town, a car full of black people passes them, going extremely fast, and Henry says that the black people have enough money to buy cars, but they don’t have licenses and insurance.
The next morning, Henry and Jean Louise’s trip has made the rounds of the town gossip, which scandalizes Alexandra, but Jean Louise and Atticus are mildly amused. The whole family goes to church, where the music director tries to conduct a hymn in a different rhythm, but the townspeople sing it exactly the way they’ve always been singing it.
After church, Atticus and Henry leave for a political meeting. Jean Louise finds a racist pamphlet titled “The Black Plague” among Atticus’s papers, and she is horrified. She follows Atticus and Henry to their meeting, which turns out to be a gathering of the Maycomb County Citizen’s Council, an organization promoting segregation and white supremacy. Nearly all the men in town are there, except Uncle Jack. The meeting is in the courthouse, and Jean Louise watches it from the same place where she and Jem sat as children to watch their father defend a black man who was on trial for rape. Then, Jean Louise was proud of her father for standing up for what was right. Now, Jean Louise is disgusted that her father can be part of something so racist. Jean Louise leaves and walks around town, feeling sickened and betrayed, and has flashbacks to her youth, in which Atticus had always been her rock-solid moral compass. Jean Louise also remembers Calpurnia, the black woman who had served as the Finches’ cook and a surrogate mother figure.
The next morning, the family learns that Calpurnia’s grandson had killed a pedestrian while speeding in his car. Atticus takes the case, but only to stop the NAACP from coming to town and getting involved. Jean Louise visits Calpurnia, but Calpurnia treats her politely and coldly, without a hint of affection. Jean Louise has lunch with Uncle Jack and asks him how Atticus could allow himself to be involved with a racist organization. Uncle Jack tries to explain that Atticus himself isn’t necessarily a racist, but he has to maintain appearances to the townspeople, and he has to understand what they’re up to (think “Know thy enemy”). Uncle Jack is trying to plant the seed for Jean Louise to come to a conclusion, but she doesn’t quite grasp what he’s trying to make her understand.
Jean Louise has a flashback to her adolescence, recalling the time that she and Henry went together to a dance. This was the first time that Jean Louise really began to feel like she was becoming a woman, not just a child or Jem’s little sister. The next day, the school principal found Jean Louise’s false bosoms, which had fallen during the night. Henry comes up with a scheme to save the day, and it later turns out that Atticus had had the idea but had planted the seed of it in Henry’s mind.
Jean Louise has coffee with Henry and tells him that she can never marry him. As she yells at Henry for being a hypocrite, she realizes that Atticus is standing right there. Jean Louise and Atticus go to his office, and they begin to argue about Brown v. Board of Education and the NAACP. Jean Louise is in favor of states’ rights, so she doesn’t entirely agree with the Supreme Court, but she argues that they had to do what was right morally, even if it might not have been the right decision politically. Atticus’s positions seem to go against everything he had taught her, and she lashes out at him.
Jean Louise goes home in a blinding rage to pack her things and leave. Uncle Jack comes over and slaps her. The slap shocks Jean Louise thoroughly, and she snaps out of her rage. He explains that Atticus is not an idol, but rather, is thoroughly human, and that Jean Louise has to rely on herself to be her own moral anchor. Jean Louise is chastened and decides to remain in Maycomb. She realizes that she won’t marry Henry. Jean Louise returns to the office to apologize to Atticus, but Atticus says that he is proud of her."
Story,"Nick Carraway, a young man from Minnesota, moves to New York in the summer of 1922 to learn about the bond business. He rents a house in the West Egg district of Long Island, a wealthy but unfashionable area populated by the new rich, a group who have made their fortunes too recently to have established social connections and who are prone to garish displays of wealth. Nick’s next-door neighbor in West Egg is a mysterious man named Jay Gatsby, who lives in a gigantic Gothic mansion and throws extravagant parties every Saturday night.
Nick is unlike the other inhabitants of West Egg—he was educated at Yale and has social connections in East Egg, a fashionable area of Long Island home to the established upper class. Nick drives out to East Egg one evening for dinner with his cousin, Daisy Buchanan, and her husband, Tom, an erstwhile classmate of Nick’s at Yale. Daisy and Tom introduce Nick to Jordan Baker, a beautiful, cynical young woman with whom Nick begins a romantic relationship. Nick also learns a bit about Daisy and Tom’s marriage: Jordan tells him that Tom has a lover, Myrtle Wilson, who lives in the valley of ashes, a gray industrial dumping ground between West Egg and New York City. Not long after this revelation, Nick travels to New York City with Tom and Myrtle. At a vulgar, gaudy party in the apartment that Tom keeps for the affair, Myrtle begins to taunt Tom about Daisy, and Tom responds by breaking her nose.
As the summer progresses, Nick eventually garners an invitation to one of Gatsby’s legendary parties. He encounters Jordan Baker at the party, and they meet Gatsby himself, a surprisingly young man who affects an English accent, has a remarkable smile, and calls everyone “old sport.” Gatsby asks to speak to Jordan alone, and, through Jordan, Nick later learns more about his mysterious neighbor. Gatsby tells Jordan that he knew Daisy in Louisville in 1917 and is deeply in love with her. He spends many nights staring at the green light at the end of her dock, across the bay from his mansion. Gatsby’s extravagant lifestyle and wild parties are simply an attempt to impress Daisy. Gatsby now wants Nick to arrange a reunion between himself and Daisy, but he is afraid that Daisy will refuse to see him if she knows that he still loves her. Nick invites Daisy to have tea at his house, without telling her that Gatsby will also be there. After an initially awkward reunion, Gatsby and Daisy reestablish their connection. Their love rekindled, they begin an affair.
After a short time, Tom grows increasingly suspicious of his wife’s relationship with Gatsby. At a luncheon at the Buchanans’ house, Gatsby stares at Daisy with such undisguised passion that Tom realizes Gatsby is in love with her. Though Tom is himself involved in an extramarital affair, he is deeply outraged by the thought that his wife could be unfaithful to him. He forces the group to drive into New York City, where he confronts Gatsby in a suite at the Plaza Hotel. Tom asserts that he and Daisy have a history that Gatsby could never understand, and he announces to his wife that Gatsby is a criminal—his fortune comes from bootlegging alcohol and other illegal activities. Daisy realizes that her allegiance is to Tom, and Tom contemptuously sends her back to East Egg with Gatsby, attempting to prove that Gatsby cannot hurt him.
When Nick, Jordan, and Tom drive through the valley of ashes, however, they discover that Gatsby’s car has struck and killed Myrtle, Tom’s lover. They rush back to Long Island, where Nick learns from Gatsby that Daisy was driving the car when it struck Myrtle, but that Gatsby intends to take the blame. The next day, Tom tells Myrtle’s husband, George, that Gatsby was the driver of the car. George, who has leapt to the conclusion that the driver of the car that killed Myrtle must have been her lover, finds Gatsby in the pool at his mansion and shoots him dead. He then fatally shoots himself.
Nick stages a small funeral for Gatsby, ends his relationship with Jordan, and moves back to the Midwest to escape the disgust he feels for the people surrounding Gatsby’s life and for the emptiness and moral decay of life among the wealthy on the East Coast. Nick reflects that just as Gatsby’s dream of Daisy was corrupted by money and dishonesty, the American dream of happiness and individualism has disintegrated into the mere pursuit of wealth. Though Gatsby’s power to transform his dreams into reality is what makes him “great,” Nick reflects that the era of dreaming—both Gatsby’s dream and the American dream—is over."
Ceaseless,"One Hundred Years of Solitude is the history of the isolated town of Macondo and of the family who founds it, the Buendías. For years, the town has no contact with the outside world, except for gypsies who occasionally visit, peddling technologies like ice and telescopes. The patriarch of the family, José Arcadio Buendía, is impulsive and inquisitive. He remains a leader who is also deeply solitary, alienating himself from other men in his obsessive investigations into mysterious matters. These character traits are inherited by his descendents throughout the novel. His older child, José Arcadio, inherits his vast physical strength and his impetuousness. His younger child, Aureliano, inherits his intense, enigmatic focus. Gradually, the village loses its innocent, solitary state when it establishes contact with other towns in the region. Civil wars begin, bringing violence and death to peaceful Macondo, which, previously, had experienced neither, and Aureliano becomes the leader of the Liberal rebels, achieving fame as Colonel Aureliano Buendía. Macondo changes from an idyllic, magical, and sheltered place to a town irrevocably connected to the outside world through the notoriety of Colonel Buendía. Macondo’s governments change several times during and after the war. At one point, Arcadio, the cruelest of the Buendías, rules dictatorially and is eventually shot by a firing squad. Later, a mayor is appointed, and his reign is peaceful until another civil uprising has him killed. After his death, the civil war ends with the signing of a peace treaty.
More than a century goes by over the course of the book, and so most of the events that García Márquez describes are the major turning points in the lives of the Buendías: births, deaths, marriages, love affairs. Some of the Buendía men are wild and sexually rapacious, frequenting brothels and taking lovers. Others are quiet and solitary, preferring to shut themselves up in their rooms to make tiny golden fish or to pore over ancient manuscripts. The women, too, range from the outrageously outgoing, like Meme, who once brings home seventy-two friends from boarding school, to the prim and proper Fernanda del Carpio, who wears a special nightgown with a hole at the crotch when she consummates her marriage with her husband.
	A sense of the family’s destiny for greatness remains alive in its tenacious matriarch, Ursula Iguarán, and she works devotedly to keep the family together despite its differences. But for the Buendía family, as for the entire village of Macondo, the centrifugal forces of modernity are devastating. Imperialist capitalism reaches Macondo as a banana plantation moves in and exploits the land and the workers, and the Americans who own the plantation settle in their own fenced-in section of town. Eventually, angry at the inhumane way in which they are treated, the banana workers go on strike. Thousands of them are massacred by the army, which sides with the plantation owners. When the bodies have been dumped into the sea, five years of ceaseless rain begin, creating a flood that sends Macondo into its final decline. As the city, beaten down by years of violence and false progress, begins to slip away, the Buendía family, too, begins its process of final erasure, overcome by nostalgia for bygone days. The book ends almost as it began: the village is once again solitary, isolated. The few remaining Buendía family members turn in upon themselves incestuously, alienated from the outside world and doomed to a solitary ending. In the last scene of the book, the last surviving Buendía translates a set of ancient prophecies and finds that all has been predicted: that the village and its inhabitants have merely been living out a preordained cycle, incorporating great beauty and great, tragic sadness."
Ears,"Part One of Wonder is told from August “Auggie” Pullman’s point of view. Auggie was born with a genetic syndrome that gives him tiny ears, low eyes, and a misshapen mouth and jaw. By the time he is twelve, he has endured twenty-seven surgeries. Auggie lives in New York City with his parents, his sister, Olivia or “Via,” and his dog, Daisy, and until the novel begins, he has been homeschooled. 
Mom wants Auggie to go to middle school, but Dad feels hesitant, worried the other students will be cruel. Mom takes Auggie to meet Beecher Prep’s principal, Mr. Tushman, who has arranged for three other students—Jack, Charlotte, and Julian—to give Auggie a tour of the school. On the first day of school, Auggie faces a barrage of shocked reactions and surprised looks as people react to his appearance for the first time. Julian teases and provokes Auggie. Mr. Browne, their English teacher, gives his students a precept every month to think and write about. The first precept is about kindness. Auggie becomes good friends with Jack and a girl named Summer who sits with Auggie at lunch of her own volition. However, on Halloween, Auggie overhears Jack telling others that he wishes Auggie would stop following him around. Hurt and rejected, Auggie questions whether he should be in school at all.
Part Two is told from Via’s point of view. Since Auggie’s birth when she was four, she has had to be independent and take a back seat to Auggie’s needs. After Via returns from spending a few weeks with her grandmother, she sees Auggie as others see him for the first time. As Via enters high school, she feels estranged from her former best friends, Ella and Miranda. Miranda has also been a good friend to Auggie and gave him the astronaut helmet that he wore for several years. Auggie confides to Via what he overheard Jack say on Halloween, and they agree school is hard for everyone, but Via encourages Auggie to “suck it up.”
In Part Three, which is told from Summer’s point of view, Summer explains that she chooses to be Auggie’s friend despite criticism from other students. They work on an Egyptian Museum project at her house, where Auggie learns more about Summer’s personal life, including the fact that her father died. Auggie and Summer talk about death and agree that maybe people get to come back with new faces. They talk openly about Auggie’s appearance. When Jack later asks Summer why Auggie is upset with him, she gives him a hint but isn’t explicit.
Part Four is told by Jack. He recalls the day when he gave Auggie the tour of the school but also recalls having seen him outside an ice cream shop before. He is used to Auggie’s face and genuinely likes him as a friend. One day, Jack has an epiphany and finally understands what Summer’s hint meant and why Auggie has been upset with him. Jack feels guilty that he lied to others about his feelings about Auggie. When Julian calls Auggie a “freak,” Jack punches him in the mouth, but he will not tell Mr. Tushman why. Mr. Tushman sends Jack home until after winter break as punishment. Through Facebook messages, Jack apologizes to Auggie, and the boys are friends again. Julian’s mother tells Mr. Tushman that Auggie doesn’t belong at Beecher Prep, but Mr. Tushman disagrees. After the break, Charlotte describes the students who are on Julian’s side, on Auggie’s side, and neutral. Jack goes to Auggie’s house to work on a science fair project. He meets Via and realizes that she knows about what happened on Halloween. Via introduces Auggie and Jack to her boyfriend, Justin.
Part Five is told by Justin. Although he’s unsettled when he meets Auggie, he likes Via and her family very much, especially compared to his parents, who are divorced and rather absent. At school, Justin is cast as the lead in Our Town, and Via has a small part and serves as an understudy for Miranda, who has been cast as Emily, the female lead. When Justin witnesses Julian and others teasing Jack one day, he tells the boys to leave Jack alone. He learns that Miranda and Via were once close friends, and Via confesses that she hasn't told her parents about the play because she doesn’t want them to bring Auggie. She is ashamed that she feels embarrassed by her brother.
In Part Six, Auggie’s point of view returns. He cringes through the science fair because so many people react to seeing him for the first time. Julian puts mean notes in Auggie’s and Jack’s lockers, but Auggie notices that students are accepting him more. When Auggie gets hearing aids, life improves dramatically. However, when he learns that Via doesn’t want him to go to her play, he angrily explodes. Meanwhile, Daisy must be euthanized, which saddens the whole Pullman family, but ultimately draws them closer together and assuages the discord between Auggie and Via. Auggie attends Via’s play with his parents, and they are delighted when they see her playing the lead. Via and Justin get standing ovations.
Part Seven is told by Miranda. In the summer before high school, at camp, she lies and tells people that she has a brother with a deformed face, which increases her popularity. Miranda’s parents are divorced and distant, but she feels safe with Via’s loving family. However, Miranda changes that summer, both in appearance and in attitude. She is cast as the lead in Our Town, but on opening night, when she sees Auggie in the audience and realizes that no one has come to see her, she pretends to be sick so that Via can play the lead. After the play, Miranda sees Auggie backstage, and they hug. The Pullmans invite her to join them for dinner, and she happily accepts.
Part Eight returns to Auggie’s point of view. When his class, minus Julian, goes to the Broarwood Nature Retreat for three days, he feels both excited and afraid. He has a vision of Daisy on his first morning and enjoys nature walks and campfires and horseback riding. On movie night, when Jack has to use the bathroom, Auggie goes with him. In the woods, they meet a group of seventh graders who say awful things to Auggie. A fight breaks out. Jack and several other boys defend and protect Auggie. Auggie gets hurt and loses his hearing aids. 
When Mom picks him up the next day, Auggie says that he had a great time except for the last night. Dad brings home a new puppy. Back at school, Auggie has become a hero along with Jack and the other boys who defended him in the woods. Julian has become irrelevant, and Auggie learns that Julian won’t return to Beecher Prep the following year. When Dad drops Auggie off for his fifth-grade graduation, Dad admits that he is the one who threw away Auggie’s space helmet years ago. Auggie feels angry but forgives him. During the ceremony, Auggie wins the Henry Ward Beecher Award for his strength and kindness and receives a standing ovation. As the Pullmans walk home, Auggie thanks his mother for sending him to school, and his mother thanks him for being such a wonder."
Indicated,"In the midst of a raging war, a plane evacuating a group of schoolboys from Britain is shot down over a deserted tropical island. Two of the boys, Ralph and Piggy, discover a conch shell on the beach, and Piggy realizes it could be used as a horn to summon the other boys. Once assembled, the boys set about electing a leader and devising a way to be rescued. They choose Ralph as their leader, and Ralph appoints another boy, Jack, to be in charge of the boys who will hunt food for the entire group.
Ralph, Jack, and another boy, Simon, set off on an expedition to explore the island. When they return, Ralph declares that they must light a signal fire to attract the attention of passing ships. The boys succeed in igniting some dead wood by focusing sunlight through the lenses of Piggy’s eyeglasses. However, the boys pay more attention to playing than to monitoring the fire, and the flames quickly engulf the forest. A large swath of dead wood burns out of control, and one of the youngest boys in the group disappears, presumably having burned to death.
At first, the boys enjoy their life without grown-ups and spend much of their time splashing in the water and playing games. Ralph, however, complains that they should be maintaining the signal fire and building huts for shelter. The hunters fail in their attempt to catch a wild pig, but their leader, Jack, becomes increasingly preoccupied with the act of hunting.
When a ship passes by on the horizon one day, Ralph and Piggy notice, to their horror, that the signal fire—which had been the hunters’ responsibility to maintain—has burned out. Furious, Ralph accosts Jack, but the hunter has just returned with his first kill, and all the hunters seem gripped with a strange frenzy, reenacting the chase in a kind of wild dance. Piggy criticizes Jack, who hits Piggy across the face. Ralph blows the conch shell and reprimands the boys in a speech intended to restore order. At the meeting, it quickly becomes clear that some of the boys have started to become afraid. The littlest boys, known as “littluns,” have been troubled by nightmares from the beginning, and more and more boys now believe that there is some sort of beast or monster lurking on the island. The older boys try to convince the others at the meeting to think rationally, asking where such a monster could possibly hide during the daytime. One of the littluns suggests that it hides in the sea—a proposition that terrifies the entire group.
Not long after the meeting, some military planes engage in a battle high above the island. The boys, asleep below, do not notice the flashing lights and explosions in the clouds. A parachutist drifts to earth on the signal-fire mountain, dead. Sam and Eric, the twins responsible for watching the fire at night, are asleep and do not see the parachutist land. When the twins wake up, they see the enormous silhouette of his parachute and hear the strange flapping noises it makes. Thinking the island beast is at hand, they rush back to the camp in terror and report that the beast has attacked them.
The boys organize a hunting expedition to search for the monster. Jack and Ralph, who are increasingly at odds, travel up the mountain. They see the silhouette of the parachute from a distance and think that it looks like a huge, deformed ape. The group holds a meeting at which Jack and Ralph tell the others of the sighting. Jack says that Ralph is a coward and that he should be removed from office, but the other boys refuse to vote Ralph out of power. Jack angrily runs away down the beach, calling all the hunters to join him. Ralph rallies the remaining boys to build a new signal fire, this time on the beach rather than on the mountain. They obey, but before they have finished the task, most of them have slipped away to join Jack.
Jack declares himself the leader of the new tribe of hunters and organizes a hunt and a violent, ritual slaughter of a sow to solemnize the occasion. The hunters then decapitate the sow and place its head on a sharpened stake in the jungle as an offering to the beast. Later, encountering the bloody, fly-covered head, Simon has a terrible vision, during which it seems to him that the head is speaking. The voice, which he imagines as belonging to the Lord of the Flies, says that Simon will never escape him, for he exists within all men. Simon faints. When he wakes up, he goes to the mountain, where he sees the dead parachutist. Understanding then that the beast does not exist externally but rather within each individual boy, Simon travels to the beach to tell the others what he has seen. But the others are in the midst of a chaotic revelry—even Ralph and Piggy have joined Jack’s feast—and when they see Simon’s shadowy figure emerge from the jungle, they fall upon him and kill him with their bare hands and teeth.
The following morning, Ralph and Piggy discuss what they have done. Jack’s hunters attack them and their few followers and steal Piggy’s glasses in the process. Ralph’s group travels to Jack’s stronghold in an attempt to make Jack see reason, but Jack orders Sam and Eric tied up and fights with Ralph. In the ensuing battle, one boy, Roger, rolls a boulder down the mountain, killing Piggy and shattering the conch shell. Ralph barely manages to escape a torrent of spears.
Ralph hides for the rest of the night and the following day, while the others hunt him like an animal. Jack has the other boys ignite the forest in order to smoke Ralph out of his hiding place. Ralph stays in the forest, where he discovers and destroys the sow’s head, but eventually, he is forced out onto the beach, where he knows the other boys will soon arrive to kill him. Ralph collapses in exhaustion, but when he looks up, he sees a British naval officer standing over him. The officer’s ship noticed the fire raging in the jungle. The other boys reach the beach and stop in their tracks at the sight of the officer. Amazed at the spectacle of this group of bloodthirsty, savage children, the officer asks Ralph to explain. Ralph is overwhelmed by the knowledge that he is safe but, thinking about what has happened on the island, he begins to weep. The other boys begin to sob as well. The officer turns his back so that the boys may regain their composure."
Fountain,"Howard Roark, a brilliant young architect, is expelled from his architecture school for refusing to follow the school’s outdated traditions. He goes to New York to work for Henry Cameron, a disgraced architect whom Roark admires. Roark’s schoolmate, Peter Keating, moves to New York and goes to work for the prestigious architectural firm Francon & Heyer, run by the famous Guy Francon. Roark and Cameron create beautiful work, but their projects rarely receive recognition, whereas Keating’s ability to flatter and please brings him almost instant success. In just a few years, he becomes a partner at the firm after he causes Francon’s previous partner to have a stroke. Henry Cameron retires, financially ruined, and Roark opens his own small office. His unwillingness to compromise his designs in order to satisfy clients eventually forces him to close down the office and take a job at a granite quarry in Connecticut.
	In Connecticut, Roark feels an immediate, passionate attraction to Dominique Francon, Guy Francon’s temperamental and beautiful daughter. Society disgusts Dominique, and she has retreated to her family’s estate to escape the mediocre architecture she sees all around her. One night, Roark enters the house and rapes her. Dominique discovers that this is what she had needed, but when she looks for Roark, he has left the quarry to design a building for a prominent New York businessman. Dominique returns to New York and discovers Roark’s identity. She realizes that he designed a building she admires. Dominique and Roark begin to meet in secret, but in public she tries to sabotage his career and destroy him. Ellsworth Toohey, an architectural critic and socialist, slowly prepares to rise to power. He seeks to prevent men from excelling by teaching that talent and ability are of no great consequence, and that the greatest virtue is humility. Toohey sees Roark as a great threat and tries to destroy him. Toohey convinces a weak-minded businessman named Hopton Stoddard to hire Roark as the designer for a temple dedicated to the human spirit, then persuades the businessman to sue Roark once the building is completed. At Roark’s trial, every prominent architect in New York testifies that Roark’s style is unorthodox and illegitimate, but Dominique declares that the world does not deserve the gift Roark has given it. Stoddard wins the case and Roark loses his business again. To punish herself for desiring Roark, Dominique marries Peter Keating.
	Enter Gail Wynand, a brilliant publisher, who has lost his early idealism and made his fortune by printing newspapers that say exactly what the public wants to hear. Wynand meets Dominique and falls in love with her, so he buys her from Keating by offering him money and a prestigious contract in exchange for his wife. Dominique agrees to marry Wynand because she thinks he is an even worse person than Keating, but to her surprise, Wynand is a man of principle. Wynand and Roark meet and become fast friends, but Wynand does not know the truth about Roark’s relationship with Dominique. Meanwhile Keating, who has fallen from grace, asks Roark for help with the Cortlandt Homes, a public housing project. The idea of economical housing intrigues Roark. He agrees to design the project and let Keating take the credit on the condition that no one makes a single alteration to his plan.
	When Roark returns from a summer-long yacht trip with Wynand, he finds that, despite the agreement, the Cortlandt Homes project has been changed. Roark asks Dominique to distract the night watchman one night and then dynamites the building. When the police arrive, he submits without resistance. The entire country condemns Roark, but Wynand finally finds the courage to follow his convictions and orders his newspapers to defend him. The Banner’s circulation drops and the workers go on strike, but Wynand keeps printing with Dominique’s help. Eventually, Wynand gives in and denounces Roark. At the trial, Roark seems doomed, but he rouses the courtroom with a statement about the value of selfishness and the need to remain true to oneself. Roark describes the triumphant role of creators and the price they pay at the hands of corrupt societies. The jury finds him not guilty. Roark marries Dominique. Wynand asks Roark to design one last building, a skyscraper that will testify to the supremacy of man."
Indispensable,"Jack Worthing, the play’s protagonist, is a pillar of the community in Hertfordshire, where he is guardian to Cecily Cardew, the pretty, eighteen-year-old granddaughter of the late Thomas Cardew, who found and adopted Jack when he was a baby. In Hertfordshire, Jack has responsibilities: he is a major landowner and justice of the peace, with tenants, farmers, and a number of servants and other employees all dependent on him. For years, he has also pretended to have an irresponsible black-sheep brother named Ernest who leads a scandalous life in pursuit of pleasure and is always getting into trouble of a sort that requires Jack to rush grimly off to his assistance. In fact, Ernest is merely Jack’s alibi, a phantom that allows him to disappear for days at a time and do as he likes. No one but Jack knows that he himself is Ernest. Ernest is the name Jack goes by in London, which is where he really goes on these occasions—probably to pursue the very sort of behavior he pretends to disapprove of in his imaginary brother.
Jack is in love with Gwendolen Fairfax, the cousin of his best friend, Algernon Moncrieff. When the play opens, Algernon, who knows Jack as Ernest, has begun to suspect something, having found an inscription inside Jack’s cigarette case addressed to “Uncle Jack” from someone who refers to herself as “little Cecily.” Algernon suspects that Jack may be leading a double life, a practice he seems to regard as commonplace and indispensable to modern life. He calls a person who leads a double life a “Bunburyist,” after a nonexistent friend he pretends to have, a chronic invalid named Bunbury, to whose deathbed he is forever being summoned whenever he wants to get out of some tiresome social obligation.
At the beginning of Act 1, Jack drops in unexpectedly on Algernon and announces that he intends to propose to Gwendolen. Algernon confronts him with the cigarette case and forces him to come clean, demanding to know who “Jack” and “Cecily” are. Jack confesses that his name isn’t really Ernest and that Cecily is his ward, a responsibility imposed on him by his adoptive father’s will. Jack also tells Algernon about his fictional brother. Jack says he’s been thinking of killing off this fake brother, since Cecily has been showing too active an interest in him. Without meaning to, Jack describes Cecily in terms that catch Algernon’s attention and make him even more interested in her than he is already.
Gwendolen and her mother, Lady Bracknell, arrive, which gives Jack an opportunity to propose to Gwendolen. Jack is delighted to discover that Gwendolen returns his affections, but he is alarmed to learn that Gwendolen is fixated on the name Ernest, which she says “inspires absolute confidence.” Gwendolen makes clear that she would not consider marrying a man who was not named Ernest.
Lady Bracknell interviews Jack to determine his eligibility as a possible son-in-law, and during this interview she asks about his family background. When Jack explains that he has no idea who his parents were and that he was found, by the man who adopted him, in a handbag in the cloakroom at Victoria Station, Lady Bracknell is scandalized. She forbids the match between Jack and Gwendolen and sweeps out of the house.
In Act 2, Algernon shows up at Jack’s country estate posing as Jack’s brother Ernest. Meanwhile, Jack, having decided that Ernest has outlived his usefulness, arrives home in deep mourning, full of a story about Ernest having died suddenly in Paris. He is enraged to find Algernon there masquerading as Ernest but has to go along with the charade. If he doesn’t, his own lies and deceptions will be revealed.
While Jack changes out of his mourning clothes, Algernon, who has fallen hopelessly in love with Cecily, asks her to marry him. He is surprised to discover that Cecily already considers that they are engaged, and he is charmed when she reveals that her fascination with “Uncle Jack’s brother” led her to invent an elaborate romance between herself and him several months ago. Algernon is less enchanted to learn that part of Cecily’s interest in him derives from the name Ernest, which, unconsciously echoing Gwendolen, she says “inspires absolute confidence.”
Algernon goes off in search of Dr. Chasuble, the local rector, to see about getting himself christened Ernest. Meanwhile, Gwendolen arrives, having decided to pay Jack an unexpected visit. Gwendolen is shown into the garden, where Cecily orders tea and attempts to play hostess. Cecily has no idea how Gwendolen figures into Jack’s life, and Gwendolen, for her part, has no idea who Cecily is. Gwendolen initially thinks Cecily is a visitor to the Manor House and is disconcerted to learn that Cecily is “Mr. Worthing’s ward.” She notes that Ernest has never mentioned having a ward, and Cecily explains that it is not Ernest Worthing who is her guardian but his brother Jack and, in fact, that she is engaged to be married to Ernest Worthing. Gwendolen points out that this is impossible as she herself is engaged to Ernest Worthing. The tea party degenerates into a war of manners.
Jack and Algernon arrive toward the climax of this confrontation, each having separately made arrangements with Dr. Chasuble to be christened Ernest later that day. Each of the young ladies points out that the other has been deceived: Cecily informs Gwendolen that her fiancé is really named Jack and Gwendolen informs Cecily that hers is really called Algernon. The two women demand to know where Jack’s brother Ernest is, since both of them are engaged to be married to him. Jack is forced to admit that he has no brother and that Ernest is a complete fiction. Both women are shocked and furious, and they retire to the house arm in arm.
Act 3 takes place in the drawing room of the Manor House, where Cecily and Gwendolen have retired. When Jack and Algernon enter from the garden, the two women confront them. Cecily asks Algernon why he pretended to be her guardian’s brother. Algernon tells her he did it in order to meet her. Gwendolen asks Jack whether he pretended to have a brother in order to come into London to see her as often as possible, and she interprets his evasive reply as an affirmation. The women are somewhat appeased but still concerned over the issue of the name. However, when Jack and Algernon tell Gwendolen and Cecily that they have both made arrangements to be christened Ernest that afternoon, all is forgiven and the two pairs of lovers embrace. At this moment, Lady Bracknell’s arrival is announced.
Lady Bracknell has followed Gwendolen from London, having bribed Gwendolen’s maid to reveal her destination. She demands to know what is going on. Gwendolen again informs Lady Bracknell of her engagement to Jack, and Lady Bracknell reiterates that a union between them is out of the question. Algernon tells Lady Bracknell of his engagement to Cecily, prompting her to inspect Cecily and inquire into her social connections, which she does in a routine and patronizing manner that infuriates Jack. He replies to all her questions with a mixture of civility and sarcasm, withholding until the last possible moment the information that Cecily is actually worth a great deal of money and stands to inherit still more when she comes of age. At this, Lady Bracknell becomes genuinely interested.
Jack informs Lady Bracknell that, as Cecily’s legal guardian, he refuses to give his consent to her union with Algernon. Lady Bracknell suggests that the two young people simply wait until Cecily comes of age, and Jack points out that under the terms of her grandfather’s will, Cecily does not legally come of age until she is thirty-five. Lady Bracknell asks Jack to reconsider, and he points out that the matter is entirely in her own hands. As soon as she consents to his marriage to Gwendolen, Cecily can have his consent to marry Algernon. However, Lady Bracknell refuses to entertain the notion. She and Gwendolen are on the point of leaving when Dr. Chasuble arrives and happens to mention Cecily’s governess, Miss Prism. At this, Lady Bracknell starts and asks that Miss Prism be sent for.
When the governess arrives and catches sight of Lady Bracknell, she begins to look guilty and furtive. Lady Bracknell accuses her of having left her sister’s house twenty-eight years before with a baby and never returned. She demands to know where the baby is. Miss Prism confesses she doesn’t know, explaining that she lost the baby, having absentmindedly placed it in a handbag in which she had meant to place the manuscript for a novel she had written. Jack asks what happened to the bag, and Miss Prism says she left it in the cloakroom of a railway station. Jack presses her for further details and goes racing offstage, returning a few moments later with a large handbag. When Miss Prism confirms that the bag is hers, Jack throws himself on her with a cry of “Mother!” It takes a while before the situation is sorted out, but before too long we understand that Jack is not the illegitimate child of Miss Prism but the legitimate child of Lady Bracknell’s sister and, therefore, Algernon’s older brother. Furthermore, Jack had been originally christened “Ernest John.” All these years Jack has unwittingly been telling the truth: Ernest is his name, as is Jack, and he does have an unprincipled younger brother—Algernon. Again the couples embrace, Miss Prism and Dr. Chasuble follow suit, and Jack acknowledges that he now understands “the vital Importance of Being Earnest.”"
Bad,"The Bottom is a mostly Black community in Ohio, situated in the hills above the mostly white, wealthier community of Medallion. The Bottom first became a community when a master gave it to his former slave. This ""gift"" was in fact a trick: the master gave the former slave a poor stretch of hilly land, convincing the slave the land was worthwhile by claiming that because it was hilly, it was closer to heaven. The trick, though, led to the growth of a vibrant community. Now the community faces a new threat; wealthy whites have taken a liking to the land, and would like to destroy much of the town in order to build a golf course.
Shadrack, a resident of the Bottom, fought in WWI. He returns a shattered man, unable to accept the complexities of the world; he lives on the outskirts of town, attempting to create order in his life. One of his methods involves compartmentalizing his fear of death in a ritual he invents and names National Suicide Day. The town is at first wary of him and his ritual, then, over time, unthinkingly accepts him.
Meanwhile, the families of the children Nel and Sula are contrasted. Nel is the product of a family that believes deeply in social conventions; hers is a stable home, though some might characterize it as rigid. Nel is uncertain of the conventional life her mother, Helene, wants for her; these doubts are hammered home when she meets Rochelle, her grandmother and a former prostitute, the only unconventional woman in her family line. Sula's family is very different: she lives with her grandmother, Eva, and her mother, Hannah, both of whom are seen by the town as eccentric and loose. Their house also serves as a home for three informally adopted boys and a steady stream of borders.
Despite their differences, Sula and Nel become fiercely attached to each other during adolescence. However, a traumatic accident changes everything. One day, Sula playfully swings a neighborhood boy, Chicken Little, around by his hands. When she loses her grip, the boy falls into a nearby river and drowns. They never tell anyone about the accident even though they did not intend to harm the boy. The two girls begin to grow apart. One day, in an accident, Sula's mother's dress catches fire and she dies of the burns.
After high school, Nel chooses to marry and settles into the conventional role of wife and mother. Sula follows a wildly divergent path and lives a life of fierce independence and total disregard for social conventions. Shortly after Nel's wedding, Sula leaves the Bottom for a period of 10 years. She has many affairs, some with white men. However, she finds people following the same boring routines elsewhere, so she returns to the Bottom and to Nel.
Upon her return, the town regards Sula as the very personification of evil for her blatant disregard of social conventions. Their hatred in part rests upon Sula's interracial relationships, but is crystallized when Sula has an affair with Nel's husband, Jude, who subsequently abandons Nel. Ironically, the community's labeling of Sula as evil actually improves their own lives. Her presence in the community gives them the impetus to live harmoniously with one another. Nel breaks off her friendship with Sula. Just before Sula dies in 1940, they achieve a half-hearted reconciliation. With Sula's death, the harmony that had reigned in the town quickly dissolves.
In 1965, with the Bottom facing the prospect of the white golf course, Nel visits Eva in the nursing home. Eva accuses her of sharing the guilt for Chicken Little's death. Her accusation forces Nel to confront the unfairness of her judgment against Sula. Nel admits to herself that she had blamed his death entirely on Sula and set herself up as the ""good"" half of the relationship. Nel comes to realize that in the aftermath of Chicken Little's death she had too quickly clung to social convention in an effort to define herself as ""good."" Nel goes to the cemetery and mourns at Sula's grave, calling out Sula's name in sadness.
Sula is a novel about ambiguity. It questions and examines the terms ""good"" and ""evil,"" often demonstrating that the two often resemble one another. The novel addresses the confusing mysteries of human emotions and relationships, ultimately concluding that social conventions are inadequate as a foundation for living one's life. The novel tempts the reader to apply the diametrically opposed terms of ""good and evil,"" ""right and wrong"" to the characters and their actions, and yet simultaneously shows why it is necessary to resist such temptation. While exploring the ways in which people try to make meaning of lives filled with conflicts over race, gender, and simple idiosyncratic points of views, Sula resists easy answers, demonstrating the ambiguity, beauty, and terror of life, in both its triumphs and horrors."
Mining,"On the night that a fire rages between the woods of Fanteland and Asanteland, Effia is born. Throughout her childhood, her mother, Baaba, is extremely cruel. As Effia grows, Baaba tells her to keep the fact that she has begun menstruating a secret so that she cannot marry their village’s new chief. Instead, Effia is sent to marry the British governor of Cape Coast Castle, James Collins. While pregnant, Effia returns to her village as her father is dying. There, she learns from her brother Fiifi that Baaba was not her real mother. Her mother was an enslaved girl named Maame who ran away into the fire the night Effia was born. Though Effia doesn’t know this, Maame married a Big Man in an Asante village and gave birth to another girl, Esi. Esi has a privileged childhood but is captured at fifteen and taken to the dungeon of the Cape Coast Castle. There, she is raped and then put on a slave ship to America.
Effia’s son Quey has a lonely childhood at the castle, though he makes friends with a boy named Cudjo. However, after Quey’s father witnesses a tender moment between the two boys, he sends Quey to live in London. Quey later goes to his mother’s village to help his uncle, Fiifi, with his work in the slave trade. Though this is not the life Quey wants, he marries the daughter of an Asante king, Nana Yaa, whom Fiifi kidnapped. Meanwhile, Esi’s daughter Ness is enslaved on a plantation in Alabama. At a previous plantation, she was forced to marry another slave, Sam, and they had a child named Kojo. One day, Ness, Sam, and Kojo attempt to escape with the help of a woman named Aku, but Ness and Sam are caught. Back at the plantation, Ness is whipped and Sam is lynched.
When Quey and Nana Yaa’s son, James, travels with them to Nana Yaa’s father’s funeral, he becomes enamored with a girl named Akosua, who chastises his family’s involvement in the slave trade. Though James is promised to marry another woman, he’s determined to marry Akosua. Eventually, James fakes his own death and finds Akosua. On Esi’s side, Aku and Kojo escape to Maryland, where Kojo, or “Jo,” works as a deckhand. Jo and his wife Anna worry about their family’s safety after the passage of the Fugitive Slave Act. One day, Anna doesn’t return home from work. After a few weeks, Jo learns that Anna was taken by a white man. Once his children are grown, a broken Jo moves to New York.
Quey and Akosua’s daughter, Abena, is unmarried at the age of twenty-five, though she is waiting for her childhood friend Ohene Nyarko to take her as his second wife. Abena and Ohene begin sleeping together, but he cannot promise to marry her until he has a good harvest. For years, the harvest is bad, and the village blames Abena. Eventually, Ohene is able to grow cocoa but promised to marry the daughter of the man who sold the plants to him. Now pregnant, Abena leaves the village for a missionary church.
In America, Jo and Anna’s son H is born on a plantation just after Anna has killed herself. H works as a sharecropper after the Civil War. After being arrested for looking at a white woman, H works in the mines as a convict. When his sentence is up, H moves to Pratt City, where he continues to work in mines but joins a union to fight for better pay and working conditions. Though his wife, Ethe, left him years earlier, he writes to her, and she returns to him.
Abena’s daughter, Akua, grows up in the missionary where her mother Abena lived after leaving the village. Akua leaves the church after the missionary tells her he drowned Abena while attempting to baptize her. Akua marries and has two daughters and a son, though she is plagued by dreams of a woman made of fire. One night, in her sleep, Akua burns her family’s hut. Only Akua, her husband, and her son, Yaw, survive. Meanwhile, H and Ethe’s daughter, Willie, moves to Harlem with her husband, Robert, and their son, Carson. Robert is light-skinned and passes as white in Harlem, which allows him to easily find work. One night, while cleaning a jazz club, Willie runs into Robert in the bathroom, and Robert’s white colleagues force him to assault her. Robert then leaves Willie. A few years later, Willie sees Robert with a white wife and son.
Yaw grows up to be a history teacher, though he has trouble finding a wife due to the scars on his face from the fire his mother set. He eventually falls in love with his house girl, Esther. She encourages Yaw to make peace with Akua, whom he hasn’t seen since he was a baby. Yaw and Esther visit Akua, who explains that she set the fire because she was haunted by the evil in their lineage. Yaw forgives his mother.
Willie’s son Carson, who now goes by the name Sonny, works for the NAACP and is involved in the Civil Rights Movement, though he feels frustrated with the lack of progress. Sonny becomes addicted to heroin after a woman, Amani, introduces him to the drug. One day, Willie explains to Sonny what happened to his father. With this knowledge, Sonny decides to finally get clean.
Yaw and Esther move to Alabama with their daughter, Marjorie. Marjorie feels a deep connection to her grandmother and to Ghana and does not fit in with either the Black or white kids in Alabama. Marjorie develops feelings for her friend Graham, a white boy, though he feels they cannot be together due to their different races. Marjorie later meets Marcus, Sonny and Amani’s son, while they are both graduate students at Stanford. Marcus and Marjorie travel together to Ghana, where Marcus is overwhelmed with emotions on visiting the Cape Coast Castle. They swim together in the water, and Marjorie welcomes Marcus home."
Theirs,"Janie Crawford, an attractive, confident, middle-aged Black woman, returns to Eatonville, Florida, after a long absence. The Black townspeople gossip about her and speculate about where she has been and what has happened to her young husband, Tea Cake. They take her confidence as aloofness, but Janie’s friend Pheoby Watson sticks up for her. Pheoby visits her to find out what has happened. Their conversation frames the story that Janie relates.
Janie explains that her grandmother raised her after her mother ran off. Nanny loves her granddaughter and is dedicated to her, but her life as a slave and experience with her own daughter, Janie’s mother, has warped her worldview. Her primary desire is to marry Janie as soon as possible to a husband who can provide security and social status for her. She finds a much older farmer named Logan Killicks and insists that Janie marry him.
After moving in with Logan, Janie is miserable. Logan is pragmatic and unromantic and, in general, treats her like a pack mule. One day, Joe Starks, a smooth-tongued and ambitious man, ambles down the road in front of the farm. He and Janie flirt in secret for a couple weeks before she runs off and marries him.
Janie and Jody, as she calls him, travel to all-Black Eatonville, where Jody hopes to have a “big voice.” A consummate politician, Jody soon succeeds in becoming the mayor, postmaster, storekeeper, and the biggest landlord in town. But Janie seeks something more than a man with a big voice. She soon becomes disenchanted with the monotonous, stifling life that she shares with Jody. She wishes that she could be a part of the rich social life in town, but Jody doesn’t allow her to interact with “common” people. Jody sees Janie as the fitting ornament to his wealth and power, and he tries to shape her into his vision of what a mayor’s wife should be. On the surface, Janie silently submits to Jody; inside, however, she remains passionate and full of dreams.
After almost two decades of marriage, Janie finally asserts herself. When Jody insults her appearance, Janie rips him to shreds in front of the townspeople, telling them all how ugly and impotent he is. In retaliation, he savagely beats her. Their marriage breaks down, and Jody becomes quite ill. After months without interacting, Janie visits him on his deathbed. Refusing to be silenced, she once again chastises him for the way that he treated her. As she berates him, he dies.
After Jody’s funeral, Janie feels free for the first time in years. She rebuffs various suitors who come to court her because she loves her newfound independence. But when Tea Cake, a man twelve years her junior, enters her life, Janie immediately senses a spark of mutual attraction. She begins dating Tea Cake despite critical gossip within the town. To everyone’s shock, Janie then marries Tea Cake nine months after Jody’s death, sells Jody’s store, and leaves town to go with Tea Cake to Jacksonville.
During the first week of their marriage, Tea Cake and Janie encounter difficulties. He steals her money and leaves her alone one night, making her think that he married her only for her money. But he returns, explaining that he never meant to leave her and that his theft occurred in a moment of weakness. Afterward, they promise to share all their experiences and opinions with each other. They move to the Everglades, where they work during the harvest season and socialize during the summer off-season. Tea Cake’s quick wit and friendliness make their shack the center of entertainment and social life.
A terrible hurricane bursts into the Everglades two years after Janie and Tea Cake’s marriage. As they desperately flee the rising waters, a rabid dog bites Tea Cake. At the time, Tea Cake doesn’t realize the dog’s condition; three weeks later, however, he falls ill. During a rabies--induced bout of madness, Tea Cake becomes convinced that Janie is cheating on him. He starts firing a pistol at her and Janie is forced to kill him to save her life. She is immediately put on trial for murder, but the all-white, all-male jury finds her not guilty. She returns to Eatonville where her former neighbors are ready to spin malicious gossip about her circumstances, assuming that Tea Cake has left her and taken her money. Janie wraps up her recounting to Pheoby, who is greatly impressed by Janie’s experiences. Back in her room that night, Janie feels at one with Tea Cake and at peace with herself."
Untamed,"O Pioneers! opens on a blustery winter day, in the town of Hanover, Nebraska, sometime between 1883 and 1890. The narrator introduces four principal characters: the very young Emil Bergson; his stalwart older sister, Alexandra; her gloomy friend Carl Linstrum; and a pretty little Bohemian child, Marie Shabata. From town, Emil and Alexandra and their neighbor Carl return home to the desolate stretch of plains known as the Divide. Alexandra's father, John Bergson, is dying. He tells his two eldest sons, Oscar and Lou, that he is entrusting the farmland, and the preservation of all that he has accomplished since his immigration from Sweden, to his daughter.
It becomes clear that Alexandra is stronger and more resolute than her brothers. When drought and depression strike three years later, Alexandra's determination allows her to persevere. Many families, including Carl Linstrum's, sell their farms and move away. But Alexandra believes in the promise of the untamed country, and so she convinces her brothers to re-mortgage their farm and buy more land. She also convinces them to adopt innovative farming techniques.
The narrative jumps sixteen years into the future, when Alexandra's faith in the land has been repaid. Lou and Oscar are married, and each owns his own farm. Alexandra's farm is the most prosperous on the Divide. Emil has been provided the wealth and luxury to leave the Divide for the State University. Crazy Ivar, the elderly, slightly imbalanced man who, earlier in the novel, gave Alexandra some controversial farming advice, now works in Alexandra's stables, although Lou and Oscar disapprove of his presence. Amid this underlying tension, Carl Linstrum returns for a long visit after years of travel. /PARAGRAPH. Meanwhile, Marie Shabata is trapped in an unhappy marriage with a sullen and difficult husband, and it becomes clear that she and Emil are falling in love. Emil decides to travel to Mexico City, fleeing the temptation that Marie presents. Alexandra and Carl slowly regain their teenage intimacy. In reaction, Lou and Oscar drive Carl out of town, fearing that his relationship with Alexandra might threaten their own children's prospects of inheriting Alexandra's farm.
Emil returns from Mexico nearly a year later, only to find that his love for Marie has grown during their separation. Once again, he resolves to flee the Divide. Before he can leave, though, tragedy strikes: his best friend, Amedee, dies unexpectedly. At a church mass, Emil enters a state of rapture and resolves to say farewell to Marie. He finds her in a similar ecstasy in her orchard, and he lies down next to her. Her jealous husband, Frank Shabata, finds them. Blinded by fury, he shoots them both dead.
Months after the murders, Alexandra Bergson has achieved some limited recovery from her sorrow; she now possesses a stoic exhaustion with life. She resolves to try to win a pardon for Frank, who is serving a ten-year sentence in a Lincoln jail. Returning from a visit to Frank in Lincoln, she finds Carl Linstrum waiting for her. As soon as he heard of Emil's death, he returned from Alaska. They find comfort and companionship in each other, and they decide to marry."
Respectable,"The Good Soldier opens with John Dowell, the narrator, informing the reader that ""this is the saddest story [he] ever heard."" His story, he explains will be about the nine-year acquaintance that he and his wife Florence had with another couple, Edward and Leonora Ashburnham. Because this novel is comprised of Dowell's thoughts as he writes them, the plot is not chronological; it shifts back and forth between past events and Dowell's current reflections on those events. Overall, the novel is divided into four parts.
In Part 1 of The Good Soldier, Dowell explains the background of the four protagonists. He and Florence are Americans, from Philadelphia and Stamford, Connecticut, respectively. Edward and Leonora are British, the former a Catholic from Ireland, and the latter an Anglican from a respected family in Fordingbridge. Dowell sees similarities between the two couples. Both Dowell's wife, Florence, and Edward Ashburnham are ""heart patients."" The couples meet in Nauheim, a health spa, in August 1904 where both ""invalids"" come to improve their health.
The four strike up a friendship. Dowell describes Edward as perfectly honest and upright, someone with whom you could trust your wife. Dowell goes on to narrate in detail an excursion that the two couples took to a town which houses Martin Luther's protest. In the bedroom, while Florence is discussing the Protest, Leonora realizes Florence and Edward will have an affair. Dowell is blind to this implication. In this part of the novel, Dowell compares their friendship to a minuet, and to ""an extraordinarily safe castle,"" but then he bemoans the end of permanence and stability now that their friendship, nine years later, is over.
Edward has been having numerous affairs: with a woman in the back of a railway car, with the mistress of a Grand Duke in Monte Carlo, with a woman married to an army officer in India, and with a young, submissive woman the Ashburnhams have brought with them from India to Nauheim. After the affair with La Dolciquita, Edward brought the Ashburnhams into deep debt, and Leonora took complete control of all his money and land. The Ashburnhams have been in India eight years to save money, and now that they are in Nauheim, Leonora feels she has regained control of their lives. On the day that they meet the Dowells, Leonora sees Maisie Maidan coming out of her husband's bedroom and she assumes they are having an affair. She boxes Mrs. Maidan's ears, and Florence sees this act of violence. Leonora, who cares deeply about propriety, attempts to befriend Florence to cover up what has been witnessed; that is how the two couples become friends.
Part 1 ends with Mrs. Maidan's death. Now that Florence has started an affair with Edward, Mrs. Maidan overhears them talking about her, and finds out that Leonora has brought her along so that she may be a ""safe"" mistress for Edward. Mrs. Maidan is appalled and dies. Unlike Florence and Edward, she suffers from a real heart condition. Leonora lives with the guilt over this death.
In Part 2, Dowell explains Florence's real desire to be the lady of Fordingbridge, in the town in England where her ancestors were forced to live centuries ago. Edward Ashburnham's estate, Branshaw Manor, is in Fordingbridge. The chapter flashes back to Dowell and Florence's first meeting in Connecticut. They were married against the wishes of Florence's aunts, the Misses Hurlbird, and immediately left for Europe. On the boat trip to Europe, Florence feigned a heart condition, and her pretend heart condition keeps them forever trapped on the European continent. While Dowell and Florence lived in Paris, Florence has an affair with a low-class artist named Jimmy, but Dowell knows nothing about it. Dowell's own marriage to Florence has remained unconsummated for thirteen years.
After Florence's nine-year affair with Edward, she plans to divorce Dowell and marry Edward. But one night, August 4, 1913, Florence sees Edward in the park alone at night with his young ward, Nancy. She grows insanely jealous and runs back to the hotel, only to find an old acquaintance, Mr. Bagshawe, telling Dowell about Florence's indecent relationship with Jimmy many years ago. Part II ends with the discovery of Florence's dead body; she has poisoned herself.
Part 3 opens with Dowell considering marriage to Nancy, the Ashburnhams"" young ward. But Edward, too, is in love with her. Nancy, who has recently left convent school, admires her uncle immensely for his heroic deeds and she assumes he and Leonora have a healthy marriage; she is not in love with him in the same way. After Florence's death, Leonora, Edward, and Nancy all return to Branshaw Manor in England. There, Leonora has a nervous breakdown, since she surmises that Edward is in love with Nancy. In this section, Dowell narrates the entire history of Edward and Leonora's marriage. Through all his affairs, Leonora always hoped that Edward would return to her and love her again. But when Edward began his affair with Florence, Leonora's love died.
In Part 4, Leonora realizes that Nancy is safe from Edward. She sees that the small amount of sexual morality that her husband possesses will keep him from starting an affair with Nancy. She has a breakdown and tells Nancy what a terrible husband Edward is. Nancy's ideals are crushed, and her eyes are opened to the realities of the world. Dowell says that together, Leonora and Nancy begin to slowly torture of Edward. He suffers greatly and plans for Nancy to travel to India to live with her father. She sends a telegram from India saying she is having a good time. Edward is crushed. All he desires is to have her worship him from afar. Edward commits suicide by stabbing himself with a penknife. Leonora remarries a ""perfectly normal"" man named Rodney Bayham and they have a child. Nancy goes mad. The only word she can say is ""shuttlecock."" Dowell buys Branshaw Manor and becomes Nancy's permanent caretaker."
Anniversary,"Guy Montag is a fireman who burns books in a futuristic American city. In Montag’s world, firemen start fires rather than putting them out. The people in this society do not read books, enjoy nature, spend time by themselves, think independently, or have meaningful conversations. Instead, they drive very fast, watch excessive amounts of television on wall-size sets, and listen to the radio on “Seashell Radio” sets attached to their ears.
Montag encounters a gentle seventeen-year-old girl named Clarisse McClellan, who opens his eyes to the emptiness of his life with her innocently penetrating questions and her unusual love of people and nature. Over the next few days, Montag experiences a series of disturbing events. First, his wife, Mildred, attempts suicide by swallowing a bottle of sleeping pills. Then, when he responds to an alarm that an old woman has a stash of hidden literature, the woman shocks him by choosing to be burned alive along with her books. A few days later, he hears that Clarisse has been killed by a speeding car. Montag’s dissatisfaction with his life increases, and he begins to search for a solution in a stash of books that he has stolen from his own fires and hidden inside an air-conditioning vent.
When Montag fails to show up for work, his fire chief, Beatty, pays a visit to his house. Beatty explains that it’s normal for a fireman to go through a phase of wondering what books have to offer, and he delivers a dizzying monologue explaining how books came to be banned in the first place. According to Beatty, special-interest groups and other “minorities” objected to books that offended them. Soon, books all began to look the same, as writers tried to avoid offending anybody. This was not enough, however, and society as a whole decided to simply burn books rather than permit conflicting opinions. Beatty tells Montag to take twenty-four hours or so to see if his stolen books contain anything worthwhile and then turn them in for incineration. Montag begins a long and frenzied night of reading.
Overwhelmed by the task of reading, Montag looks to his wife for help and support, but she prefers television to her husband’s company and cannot understand why he would want to take the terrible risk of reading books. He remembers that he once met a retired English professor named Faber sitting in a park, and he decides that this man might be able to help him understand what he reads. He visits Faber, who tells him that the value of books lies in the detailed awareness of life that they contain. Faber says that Montag needs not only books but also the leisure to read them and the freedom to act upon their ideas.
Faber agrees to help Montag with his reading, and they concoct a risky scheme to overthrow the status quo. Faber will contact a printer and begin reproducing books, and Montag will plant books in the homes of firemen to discredit the profession and to destroy the machinery of censorship. Faber gives him a two-way radio earpiece (the “green bullet”) so that he can hear what Montag hears and talk to him secretly.
Montag goes home, and soon two of his wife’s friends arrive to watch television. The women discuss their families and the war that is about to be declared in an extremely frivolous manner. Their superficiality angers him, and he takes out a book of poetry and reads “Dover Beach” by Matthew Arnold. Faber buzzes in his ear for him to be quiet, and Mildred tries to explain that the poetry reading is a standard way for firemen to demonstrate the uselessness of literature. The women are extremely disturbed by the poem and leave to file a complaint against Montag.
Montag goes to the fire station and hands over one of his books to Beatty. Beatty confuses Montag by barraging him with contradictory quotations from great books. Beatty exploits these contradictions to show that literature is morbid and dangerously complex, and that it deserves incineration. Suddenly, the alarm sounds, and they rush off to answer the call, only to find that the alarm is at Montag’s own house. Mildred gets into a cab with her suitcase, and Montag realizes that his own wife has betrayed him.
Beatty forces Montag to burn the house himself; when he is done, Beatty places him under arrest. When Beatty continues to berate Montag, Montag turns the flamethrower on his superior and proceeds to burn him to ashes. Montag knocks the other firemen unconscious and runs. The Mechanical Hound, a monstrous machine that Beatty has set to attack Montag, pounces and injects Montag’s leg with a large dose of anesthetic. Montag manages to destroy it with his flamethrower; then he walks off the numbness in his leg and escapes with some books that were hidden in his backyard. He hides these in another fireman’s house and calls in an alarm from a pay phone.
Montag goes to Faber’s house, where he learns that a new Hound has been put on his trail, along with several helicopters and a television crew. Faber tells Montag that he is leaving for St. Louis to see a retired printer who may be able to help them. Montag gives Faber some money and tells him how to remove Montag’s scent from his house so the Hound will not enter it. Montag then takes some of Faber’s old clothes and runs off toward the river. The whole city watches as the chase unfolds on TV, but Montag manages to escape in the river and change into Faber’s clothes to disguise his scent. He drifts downstream into the country and follows a set of abandoned railroad tracks until he finds a group of renegade intellectuals (“the Book People”), led by a man named Granger, who welcome him. They are a part of a nationwide network of book lovers who have memorized many great works of literature and philosophy. They hope that they may be of some help to mankind in the aftermath of the war that has just been declared. Montag’s role is to memorize the Book of Ecclesiastes. Enemy jets appear in the sky and completely obliterate the city with bombs. Montag and his new friends move on to search for survivors and rebuild civilization."
Hardier,"The poor peddler John Durbeyfield is stunned to learn that he is the descendent of an ancient noble family, the d’Urbervilles. Meanwhile, Tess, his eldest daughter, joins the other village girls in the May Day dance, where Tess briefly exchanges glances with a young man. Mr. Durbeyfield and his wife decide to send Tess to the d’Urberville mansion, where they hope Mrs. d’Urberville will make Tess’s fortune. In reality, Mrs. d’Urberville is no relation to Tess at all: her husband, the merchant Simon Stokes, simply changed his name to d’Urberville after he retired. But Tess does not know this fact, and when the lascivious Alec d’Urberville, Mrs. d’Urberville’s son, procures Tess a job tending fowls on the d’Urberville estate, Tess has no choice but to accept, since she blames herself for an accident involving the family’s horse, its only means of income.
Tess spends several months at this job, resisting Alec’s attempts to seduce her. Finally, Alec takes advantage of her in the woods one night after a fair. Tess knows she does not love Alec. She returns home to her family to give birth to Alec’s child, whom she christens Sorrow. Sorrow dies soon after he is born, and Tess spends a miserable year at home before deciding to seek work elsewhere. She finally accepts a job as a milkmaid at the Talbothays Dairy.
At Talbothays, Tess enjoys a period of contentment and happiness. She befriends three of her fellow milkmaids—Izz, Retty, and Marian—and meets a man named Angel Clare, who turns out to be the man from the May Day dance at the beginning of the novel. Tess and Angel slowly fall in love. They grow closer throughout Tess’s time at Talbothays, and she eventually accepts his proposal of marriage. Still, she is troubled by pangs of conscience and feels she should tell Angel about her past. She writes him a confessional note and slips it under his door, but it slides under the carpet and Angel never sees it.
After their wedding, Angel and Tess both confess indiscretions: Angel tells Tess about an affair he had with an older woman in London, and Tess tells Angel about her history with Alec. Tess forgives Angel, but Angel cannot forgive Tess. He gives her some money and boards a ship bound for Brazil, where he thinks he might establish a farm. He tells Tess he will try to accept her past but warns her not to try to join him until he comes for her.
Tess struggles. She has a difficult time finding work and is forced to take a job at an unpleasant and unprosperous farm. She tries to visit Angel’s family but overhears his brothers discussing Angel’s poor marriage, so she leaves. She hears a wandering preacher speak and is stunned to discover that he is Alec d’Urberville, who has been converted to Christianity by Angel’s father, the Reverend Clare. Alec and Tess are each shaken by their encounter, and Alec appallingly begs Tess never to tempt him again. Soon after, however, he again begs Tess to marry him, having turned his back on his -religious ways.
Tess learns from her sister Liza-Lu that her mother is near death, and Tess is forced to return home to take care of her. Her mother recovers, but her father unexpectedly dies soon after. When the family is evicted from their home, Alec offers help. But Tess refuses to accept, knowing he only wants to obligate her to him again.
At last, Angel decides to forgive his wife. He leaves Brazil, desperate to find her. Instead, he finds her mother, who tells him Tess has gone to a village called Sandbourne. There, he finds Tess in an expensive boardinghouse called The Herons, where he tells her he has forgiven her and begs her to take him back. Tess tells him he has come too late. She was unable to resist and went back to Alec d’Urberville. Angel leaves in a daze, and, heartbroken to the point of madness, Tess goes upstairs and stabs her lover to death. When the landlady finds Alec’s body, she raises an alarm, but Tess has already fled to find Angel.
Angel agrees to help Tess, though he cannot quite believe that she has actually murdered Alec. They hide out in an empty mansion for a few days, then travel farther. When they come to Stonehenge, Tess goes to sleep, but when morning breaks shortly thereafter, a search party discovers them. Tess is arrested and sent to jail. Angel and Liza-Lu watch as a black flag is raised over the prison, signaling Tess’s execution."
Abode,"On the morning of February 10, 1675, the British settlement of Lancaster, in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, is besieged by Native Americans. The attackers burn down houses and open fire on the settlers, wounding and killing several of them, and take a number of the survivors captive. Mary Rowlandson is one of the wounded, as is her youngest child, Sarah. Other members of Rowlandson’s family are killed outright. As the melee dies down, the Native Americans begin to lead their captives, including Rowlandson and her three children, from the settlement into the surrounding wilderness. At this point, Rowlandson and her two elder children are separated, but she and the youngest are allowed to remain together.
After a night spent in an abandoned town nearby, from which colonists had fled in fear of Indian attack, the captors and their captives begin to trek westward, farther into the forest. As Rowlandson and her daughter are both wounded, the journey is difficult and painful. After another day of travel, they reach an Indian settlement called Wenimesset. Here, Rowlandson meets another British captive, Robert Pepper, who wants to offer the new captives comfort. The Indians and their captives remain in Wenimesset for over a week, and during this time, Rowlandson’s wounded child becomes more ill, finally dying on February 18. By this time, Rowlandson’s original captor has sold her to a Saggamore Indian named Quannopin, who is related by marriage to King Philip. Quannopin oversees the burial of Rowlandson’s dead child, and a grieving Rowlandson visits her elder daughter (also named Mary), who she learns is also being held in Wenimesset. As she despairs over the fate of her family, her son visits her—he has been allowed to come from the nearby Indian settlement where he is being held in captivity. Meanwhile, the Indians continue to attack British towns, including Medfield, killing and looting as they go. Her captors give Rowlandson a Bible, part of the spoils of Medfield, and in it she finds comfort and hope.
After the fighting at Medfield, the Indians decide again to “remove” westward, now heading north as well. Rowlandson is again separated from her family and acquaintances. After a four-day rest in the forest, the band of Indians with whom Rowlandson is traveling begins to travel more swiftly. Rowlandson suspects that the British army must be close. They reach the Baquaug River and cross it, and the English arrive close behind. The British soldiers, however, are unable to ford the river, and the Indians and Rowlandson continue to the northwest. Rowlandson and her captors soon reach the Connecticut River, which they plan to cross in order to meet with King Philip. Here, however, are English scouts, and the Indians and Rowlandson are forced to scatter in the forest to remain undetected. Rowlandson again meets up with her son and his captors, though they must soon part ways.
After this detour, Rowlandson and the Indians cross the river, and on the other side, she meets with King Philip as planned. For some time, she remains at this settlement, sewing clothes for the Indians in return for food. The Indians, meanwhile, raid Northampton and return with spoils, including horses. Rowlandson asks to be taken to Albany on horseback, hoping that there she will be “sold” in exchange for gunpowder, but instead, the Indians prepare to take her northward and over the river once more.
After a brief sojourn at a settlement five miles north of King Philip’s abode, Rowlandson’s captors once again bring her north but then turn south again. Rowlandson hopes she’ll be returned home, but the Indians delay the journey, continuing south down the Connecticut River rather than turning east toward civilization. Indian attacks on British towns continue, and another captive, Thomas Read, joins Rowlandson’s group. From Read, Rowlandson learns that her husband is alive and well, which heartens her. Rowlandson also sees her son again, briefly. Rowlandson and her captors finally begin to move east.
They again cross the Baquaug River. Messengers meet them and report that Rowlandson must go to Wachuset, where the Indians will meet to discuss her possible return to freedom. More hopeful than she has been in some time, Rowlandson eagerly sets off toward the council’s meeting place. But the journey tires her, and she is disheartened by the sight of an injured colonist, wounded in still another Indian attack. At Wachuset, she speaks with King Philip, who promises her she’ll be free in two weeks. Nonetheless, the council continues to deliberate, asking Rowlandson how much her husband would be willing to pay them as ransom. The Indians then send a letter to Boston, stating that Rowlandson can be redeemed for twenty pounds. Meanwhile, attacks on British settlements continue, including an attack on Sudbury, after which Rowlandson must travel with her captors back into the forest.
As the Indians celebrate their victories, messengers arrive from the council, along with an Englishman named John Hoar. Rowlandson hopes she’ll be allowed to leave with Hoar, but negotiations continue for several more days. Rowlandson is finally allowed to travel back to now-abandoned Lancaster, then on to Concord, and finally to Boston. After nearly twelve weeks in the wilderness, Rowlandson is reunited with her husband. The two stay with a friend in Concord for eleven weeks, during which time Rowlandson’s sister is also released from her captivity. Rowlandson’s son and daughter are eventually returned as well. The family, together again at last, sets up a new household in Boston, where they continue to live until 1677."
Gravity,"In Part I of The Elegant Universe, “The Edge of Knowledge,” Greene introduces the central problem of modern physics: the incompatibility of Einstein’s theory of general relativity with quantum mechanics. He then lists the physical curiosities—properties of the motion of light, gravity, and the behavior of particles at the subatomic level—that have prevented physicists from establishing a single coherent theory for how the universe works. For most of the twentieth century, physicists contented themselves with describing either the most small-scale or the most large-scale workings of the cosmos, but never both simultaneously. At the end of this section, Greene describes both the objectives and the promise of superstring theory, which attempts to merge the laws of general relativity with those of quantum mechanics.
Without dismissing the importance of electrons and quarks, which are the basis of quantum mechanics, superstring theory depicts the smallest particles in the universe not as dots but as tiny strings of energy. These strings are one hundred billion billion (a quintillion) times smaller than a single atomic nucleus. They vibrate in different patterns, which in turn produce different particle properties. But because these strings are too tiny to locate with current scientific tools, superstring theory is not yet predictable or testable. Therefore, physicists like Greene must work with approximations of equations until more information has been verified. Still, the promise of string theory is tremendous. Only string theory’s conceptual framework offers any possibility of unifying general relativity and quantum mechanics into one complete understanding of how the universe works.
In Part II, “The Dilemma of Space, Time, and the Quanta,” Greene reviews the basic precepts of the two competing theories—first, Einstein’s special and general relativity, and then the “microscopic weirdness” of quantum mechanics. General relativity presupposes a smooth surface of space, but at an ultramicroscopic level (which quantum mechanics has helped unveil), the spatial fabric is subject to violent undulations known as “quantum foam.” Greene also discusses the basic principle of quantum mechanics: the uncertainty principle. The uncertainty principle predicts the impossibility of knowing both the exact location and the velocity of a particle at any given time. Greene goes over the four fundamental forces—the strong force, the weak force, electromagnetism, and gravity—and he describes the complexity of incorporating gravity into the standard model of the first three. In the last chapter of this section, Greene stresses the necessity of finding a new theory that revises both general relativity and quantum mechanics. Like many of his colleagues, Greene simply cannot accept that the universe is, at its core, divided into two contradictory theoretical frameworks.
In Part III, “The Cosmic Symphony,” Greene discusses in detail how superstring theory works. He employs many musical metaphors to suggest how strings “harmonize” or bring together the most puzzling aspects of the cosmos. After praising the elegance and economy of the theory, Greene gives a brief history of its first incarnation in the 1970s, when it was referred to as the bosonic string theory. He also explains the subsequent revisions the theory underwent during the first superstring revolution in 1984. Greene then describes how supersymmetry— a concept that predicts the existence of superpartners that correspond with all known particles—transformed string theory into superstring theory.
With these basics covered, Greene proceeds to one of the oddest claims of string theory: the theory that the universe contains far more dimensions than we can perceive. In its current form, superstring theory postulates the existence of eleven total dimensions: ten of space and one of time. According to the theory, equations of quantum theory can mesh beautifully with relativity if we assume the existence of eleven dimensions. Greene concludes “The Cosmic Symphony” by analyzing the central difficulty of string theory—namely, the lack of experimental evidence for superstring theory. He describes the efforts he and his colleagues have made to develop string theory and refine its underlying mathematical principles. He shows what a Calabi-Yau space (the six-dimensional shape that physicists believe the additional, curled-up dimensions of space will form) may look like.
Part IV, “String Theory and the Fabric of Spacetime,” is the most complicated and involved section of the book. Greene begins with an overview of quantum geometry and the new kind of math that must emerge to explain the universe on an ultramicroscopic scale. He argues that contrary to what physicists previously believed, the fabric of space can be ripped and torn with no catastrophic consequences. He also covers the second superstring revolution, which shows that all five string theories are really part of a single, unified framework called M-theory. It is fitting that no one knows what the “M” signifies, because M-theory is one of the most radical, incompletely understood theories ever to evolve. M-theory proposes the unification of gravity with the three nongravitational forces. It is an extension of string theory that suggests the elementary particles of the universe might include, in addition to strings, two-dimensional membranes and three-dimensional blobs of varying size. Greene ends his discussion of the latest advances in superstring theory by discussing its cosmological implications, what it might reveal about the origins of the universe.
Part V, “Unification in the Twenty-First Century,” concludes the book. It covers the prospects of string theory in the twenty-first century. It describes the advances Greene and other string theorists hope to make in unveiling a single theory to explain the entire universe. For all his optimistic predictions, however, Greene never hesitates to admit that because of its complexity, superstring theory might not be fully understood for many years."
Exciting,"The Giver is written from the point of view of Jonas, an eleven-year-old boy living in a futuristic society that has eliminated all pain, fear, war, and hatred. There is no prejudice, since everyone looks and acts basically the same, and there is very little competition. Everyone is unfailingly polite. The society has also eliminated choice: at age twelve every member of the community is assigned a job based on his or her abilities and interests. Citizens can apply for and be assigned compatible spouses, and each couple is assigned exactly two children each. The children are born to Birthmothers, who never see them, and spend their first year in a Nurturing Center with other babies, or “newchildren,” born that year. When their children are grown, family units dissolve and adults live together with Childless Adults until they are too old to function in the society. Then they spend their last years being cared for in the House of the Old until they are finally “released” from the society. In the community, release is death, but it is never described that way; most people think that after release, flawed newchildren and joyful elderly people are welcomed into the vast expanse of Elsewhere that surrounds the communities. Citizens who break rules or fail to adapt properly to the society’s codes of behavior are also released, though in their cases it is an occasion of great shame. Everything is planned and organized so that life is as convenient and pleasant as possible.
Jonas lives with his father, a Nurturer of new children, his mother, who works at the Department of Justice, and his seven-year-old sister Lily. At the beginning of the novel, he is apprehensive about the upcoming Ceremony of Twelve, when he will be given his official Assignment as a new adult member of the community. He does not have a distinct career preference, although he enjoys volunteering at a variety of different jobs. Though he is a well-behaved citizen and a good student, Jonas is different: he has pale eyes, while most people in his community have dark eyes, and he has unusual powers of perception. Sometimes objects “change” when he looks at them. He does not know it yet, but he alone in his community can perceive flashes of color; for everyone else, the world is as devoid of color as it is of pain, hunger, and inconvenience.
At the Ceremony of Twelve, Jonas is given the highly honored Assignment of Receiver of Memory. The Receiver is the sole keeper of the community’s collective memory. When the community went over to Sameness—its painless, warless, and mostly emotionless state of tranquility and harmony—it abandoned all memories of pain, war, and emotion, but the memories cannot disappear totally. Someone must keep them so that the community can avoid making the mistakes of the past, even though no one but the Receiver can bear the pain. Jonas receives the memories of the past, good and bad, from the current Receiver, a wise old man who tells Jonas to call him the Giver.
The Giver transmits memories by placing his hands on Jonas’s bare back. The first memory he receives is of an exhilarating sled ride. As Jonas receives memories from the Giver—memories of pleasure and pain, of bright colors and extreme cold and warm sun, of excitement and terror and hunger and love—he realizes how bland and empty life in his community really is. The memories make Jonas’s life richer and more meaningful, and he wishes that he could give that richness and meaning to the people he loves. But in exchange for their peaceful existence, the people of Jonas’s community have lost the capacity to love him back or to feel deep passion about anything. Since they have never experienced real suffering, they also cannot appreciate the real joy of life, and the life of individual people seems less precious to them. In addition, no one in Jonas’s community has ever made a choice of his or her own. Jonas grows more and more frustrated with the members of his community, and the Giver, who has felt the same way for many years, encourages him. The two grow very close, like a grandfather and a grandchild might have in the days before Sameness, when family members stayed in contact long after their children were grown.
Meanwhile, Jonas is helping his family take care of a problem newchild, Gabriel, who has trouble sleeping through the night at the Nurturing Center. Jonas helps the child to sleep by transmitting soothing memories to him every night, and he begins to develop a relationship with Gabriel that mirrors the family relationships he has experienced through the memories. When Gabriel is in danger of being released, the Giver reveals to Jonas that release is the same as death. Jonas’s rage and horror at this revelation inspire the Giver to help Jonas devise a plan to change things in the community forever. The Giver tells Jonas about the girl who had been designated the new Receiver ten years before. She had been the Giver’s own daughter, but the sadness of some of the memories had been too much for her and she had asked to be released. When she died, all of the memories she had accumulated were released into the community, and the community members could not handle the sudden influx of emotion and sensation. The Giver and Jonas plan for Jonas to escape the community and to actually enter Elsewhere. Once he has done that, his larger supply of memories will disperse, and the Giver will help the community to come to terms with the new feelings and thoughts, changing the society forever.
However, Jonas is forced to leave earlier than planned when his father tells him that Gabriel will be released the next day. Desperate to save Gabriel, Jonas steals his father’s bicycle and a supply of food and sets off for Elsewhere. Gradually, he enters a landscape full of color, animals, and changing weather, but also hunger, danger, and exhaustion. Avoiding search planes, Jonas and Gabriel travel for a long time until heavy snow makes bike travel impossible. Half-frozen, but comforting Gabriel with memories of sunshine and friendship, Jonas mounts a high hill. There he finds a sled—the sled from his first transmitted memory—waiting for him at the top. Jonas and Gabriel experience a glorious downhill ride on the sled. Ahead of them, they see—or think they see—the twinkling lights of a friendly village at Christmas, and they hear music. Jonas is sure that someone is waiting for them there."
Carriers,"Buck, a powerful dog, half St. Bernard and half sheepdog, lives on Judge Miller’s estate in California’s Santa Clara Valley. He leads a comfortable life there, but it comes to an end when men discover gold in the Klondike region of Canada and a great demand arises for strong dogs to pull sleds. Buck is kidnapped by a gardener on the Miller estate and sold to dog traders, who teach Buck to obey by beating him with a club and, subsequently, ship him north to the Klondike.
Arriving in the chilly North, Buck is amazed by the cruelty he sees around him. As soon as another dog from his ship, Curly, gets off the boat, a pack of huskies violently attacks and kills her. Watching her death, Buck vows never to let the same fate befall him. Buck becomes the property of Francois and Perrault, two mail carriers working for the Canadian government, and begins to adjust to life as a sled dog. He recovers the instincts of his wild ancestors: he learns to fight, scavenge for food, and sleep beneath the snow on winter nights. At the same time, he develops a fierce rivalry with Spitz, the lead dog in the team. One of their fights is broken up when a pack of wild dogs invades the camp, but Buck begins to undercut Spitz’s authority, and eventually the two dogs become involved in a major fight. Buck kills Spitz and takes his place as the lead dog.
With Buck at the head of the team, Francois and Perrault’s sled makes record time. However, the men soon turn the team over to a mail carrier who forces the dogs to carry much heavier loads. In the midst of a particularly arduous trip, one of the dogs becomes ill, and eventually the driver has to shoot him. At the end of this journey, the dogs are exhausted, and the mail carrier sells them to a group of American gold hunters—Hal, Charles, and Mercedes.
Buck’s new masters are inexperienced and out of place in the wilderness. They overload the sled, beat the dogs, and plan poorly. Halfway through their journey, they begin to run out of food. While the humans bicker, the dogs begin to starve, and the weaker animals soon die. Of an original team of fourteen, only five are still alive when they limp into John Thornton’s camp, still some distance from their destination. Thornton warns them that the ice over which they are traveling is melting and that they may fall through it. Hal dismisses these warnings and tries to get going immediately. The other dogs begin to move, but Buck refuses. When Hal begins to beat him, Thornton intervenes, knocking a knife from Hal’s hand and cutting Buck loose. Hal curses Thornton and starts the sled again, but before they have gone a quarter of a mile, the ice breaks open, swallowing both the humans and the dogs.
Thornton becomes Buck’s master, and Buck’s devotion to him is total. He saves Thornton from drowning in a river, attacks a man who tries to start a fight with Thornton in a bar, and, most remarkably, wins a $1,600 wager for his new master by pulling a sled carrying a thousand-pound load. But Buck’s love for Thornton is mixed with a growing attraction to the wild, and he feels as if he is being called away from civilization and into the wilderness. This feeling grows stronger when he accompanies Thornton and his friends in search of a lost mine hidden deep in the Canadian forest.
While the men search for gold, Buck ranges far afield, befriending wolves and hunting bears and moose. He always returns to Thornton in the end, until, one day, he comes back to camp to find that Yeehat Indians have attacked and killed his master. Buck attacks the Indians, killing several and scattering the rest, and then heads off into the wild, where he becomes the leader of a pack of wolves. He becomes a legendary figure, a Ghost Dog, fathering countless cubs and inspiring fear in the Yeehats—but every year he returns to the place where Thornton died, to mourn his master before returning to his life in the wild."
T,"The protagonist, who is named Tim O’Brien, begins by describing an event that occurred in the middle of his Vietnam experience. “The Things They Carried” catalogs the variety of things his fellow soldiers in the Alpha Company brought on their missions. Several of these things are intangible, including guilt and fear, while others are specific physical objects, including matches, morphine, M-16 rifles, and M&M’s candy.
Throughout the collection, the same characters reappear in various stories. The first member of the Alpha Company to die is Ted Lavender, a “grunt,” or low-ranking soldier, who deals with his anxiety about the war by taking tranquilizers and smoking marijuana. Lavender is shot in the head on his way back from going to the bathroom, and his superior, Lieutenant Jimmy Cross, blames himself for the tragedy. When Lavender is shot, Cross is distracting himself with thoughts of Martha, a college crush. It is revealed in “Love” that Cross’s feelings for Martha, whom he dated once before leaving for Vietnam, were never reciprocated, and that even twenty years after the war, his guilt over Lavender’s death remains.
In “On the Rainy River,” the narrator, O’Brien, explains the series of events that led him to Vietnam in the first place. He receives his draft notice in June of 1968, and his feelings of confusion drive him north to the Canadian border, which he contemplates crossing so that he will not be forced to fight in a war in which he doesn’t believe. Sitting in a rowboat with the proprietor of the Tip Top Lodge, where he stays, O’Brien decides that his guilt about avoiding the war and fear of disappointing his family are more important than his political convictions. He soon leaves, going first back home to Worthington, Minnesota and later to Vietnam.
In addition to Ted Lavender, a few other members of the Alpha Company are killed during their mission overseas, including Curt Lemon, who is killed when he steps on a rigged mortar round. Though O’Brien is not close to Lemon, in “The Dentist,” he tells a story of how Lemon, who faints before a routine checkup with an army-issued dentist, tries to save face by insisting that a perfectly good tooth be pulled. Lee Strunk, another member of the company, dies from injuries he sustains by stepping on a landmine. In “Friends,” O’Brien remembers that before Strunk was fatally hurt, Strunk and Dave Jensen had made a pact that if either man were irreparably harmed, the other man would see that he was quickly killed. However, when Strunk is actually hurt, he begs Jensen to spare him, and Jensen complies. Instead of being upset by the news of his friend’s swift death en route to treatment, Jensen is relieved.
The death that receives the most attention in The Things They Carried is that of Kiowa, a much-loved member of the Alpha Company and one of O’Brien’s closest friends. In “Speaking of Courage,” the story of Kiowa’s death is relayed in retrospect through the memory of Norman Bowker, years after the war. As Bowker drives around a lake in his Iowa hometown, he thinks that he failed to save Kiowa, who was killed when a mortar round hit and caused him to sink headfirst into a marshy field. O’Brien realizes that he has dealt with his guilt over Kiowa’s death differently than Norman Bowker in “Notes.” Just before the end of the war, O’Brien receives a long letter from Bowker that says he hasn’t found a way to make life meaningful after the war. O’Brien resolves to tell Bowker’s story, and the story of Kiowa’s death, in order to negotiate his own feelings of guilt and hollowness.
Like “Love” and “Notes,” several of O’Brien’s stories are told from a perspective twenty years after the Vietnam War, when he is a forty-three-year-old writer living in Massachusetts. Exposure to the guilt of old friends like Jimmy Cross and Norman Bowker prompts him to write stories in order to understand what they were going through. But two stories, “The Man I Killed” and “Ambush,” are written so that O’Brien can confront his own guilt over killing a man with a grenade outside the village of My Khe. In “The Man I Killed,” O’Brien imagines the life of his victim, from his childhood to the way things would have turned out for him had O’Brien not spotted him on a path and thrown a grenade at his feet. In “Ambush,” O’Brien imagines how he might relay the story of the man he killed to his nine-year-old daughter, Kathleen. In this second story, O’Brien provides more details of the actual killing—including the sound of the grenade and his own feelings—and explains that even well after the fact, he hasn’t finished sorting out the experience.
In the last story, “The Lives of the Dead,” O’Brien gives another twist to his contention that stories have the power to save people. In the stories of Curt Lemon and Kiowa, O’Brien explains that his imagination allowed him to grapple successfully with his guilt and confusion over the death of his fourth-grade first love, Linda."
Apology,"Rashad and Quinn are both students at Springfield Central High School. They have some friends in common but have never interacted with each other. Rashad is Black, and his father has told him throughout his life about the importance of discipline for young Black men. Rashad’s father joined the army and then the police force before retiring and often tells Rashad that the army is the best opportunity for a Black man to succeed in the United States. Because of this, Rashad is part of the Reserve Officer Training Corps, or ROTC. However, Rashad would rather spend his time drawing and hanging out with his friends English, Shannon, and Carlos. 
Quinn is white, and his father died in Afghanistan. Quinn lives with his mother and his younger brother, Willy, and resents that people expect him to live up to the memory of his father. Quinn’s best friends are Dwyer and Guzzo, who lives across the street. Guzzo’s brother, Paul Galluzzo, is a police officer and has acted as a father figure to Quinn ever since Quinn’s father died. Quinn, Dwyer, and Guzzo are on the basketball team together, along with English.
One Friday, Rashad and Quinn are each planning on going to a party with their friends at Guzzo and Paul’s cousin Jill’s house. Quinn has a crush on Jill. On the way to the party, Rashad stops at Jerry’s Corner Mart to pick up some chips and gum. Jerry’s is always monitored by a police officer as a response to shoplifting incidents at the store. While Rashad is picking out chips, he goes to text his brother, Spoony. His phone is in his bag, so he puts it on the floor and kneels down to take the phone out. While he is kneeling, a woman who was standing behind him backs up and trips over him, causing them both to fall over and Rashad’s chips to slide up the aisle. 
The police officer on duty comes over and asks what happened but assumes Rashad was trying to steal before Rashad or the woman can explain. The police officer drags Rashad outside, handcuffs him, throws him to the ground, and begins beating him. Meanwhile, Quinn and his friends have been waiting in the alley next to Jerry’s to ask an adult to buy them beer that they can take to the party. When Quinn goes around to the front of Jerry’s, he sees what the police officer is doing to Rashad. He recognizes the police officer as Paul Galluzzo. He tells his friends to run and, when they are far enough away, explains what happened and tells Guzzo that he saw his brother. The three decide to go to the party and try to forget about it.
Over the weekend, Rashad wakes up in the hospital with a broken nose and ribs and is told he needs to stay there so the doctors can monitor his internal bleeding. Rashad’s father questions whether Rashad was presenting himself in a way that made him seem dangerous, while Spoony is outraged at the situation. The local news obtains footage of Paul beating Rashad and begins covering the story. The Galluzzo family decides to have a cookout on Sunday, which Quinn and Jill both find strange. Quinn and Jill talk at the cookout about what Paul did to Rashad, while Paul and Guzzo try to intimidate Quinn into not saying anything about what he saw.
At school that week, everyone is talking about what happened to Rashad. Quinn feels conflicted as he has only ever seen the good side of Paul and doesn’t know Rashad. On Tuesday, someone has painted graffiti on the sidewalk in front of the school that says, “Rashad is absent again today.” This message creates a division in the school between those who believe Rashad was innocent and those who believe Paul was just doing his job. When Rashad sees a picture of the graffiti, he knows it is Carlos’s work. 
Spoony and his girlfriend, Berry, plan a protest that coming Friday against the police department. Guzzo continues to question Quinn’s loyalty. At first, Quinn wants to believe that Paul was just trying to do his job, but he just can’t forget what he saw outside Jerry’s. On Thursday, Quinn wears a shirt to school that says, “I’m marching. Are you?” The coach of the basketball team tells the players not to go to the protest and tells Quinn he will call his mother to tell her about his shirt. Quinn’s mother confronts him about the protest, and Quinn says he is standing up for what he believes in, just as his father would have done.
The doctor releases Rashad from the hospital on Thursday, and Rashad plans on joining the protest the following day. On Friday morning, Rashad and Quinn both feel nervous about the protest. Quinn sees a tank-like police vehicle headed toward the school and worries about the protesters’ safety. However, after talking with Jill, he understands that Black people live in fear of police violence every day and that they should put themselves at risk for one day to speak out against this reality. Rashad and Quinn, along with an enormous crowd, march from Jerry’s Corner Mart to the police department, where they stage a die-in as Berry reads aloud the names of unarmed Black people killed by police officers. Rashad and Quinn notice each other during the die-in and feel a connection as they both think of the people on the list and how they will keep fighting for them."
Volume,"The action covered in Tristram Shandy spans the years 1680-1766. Sterne obscures the story's underlying chronology, however, by rearranging the order of the various pieces of his tale. He also subordinates the basic plot framework by weaving together a number of different stories, as well as such disparate materials as essays, sermons, and legal documents. There are, nevertheless, two clearly discernible narrative lines in the book.
The first is the plot sequence that includes Tristram's conception, birth, christening, and accidental circumcision. (This sequence extends somewhat further in Tristram's treatment of his ""breeching,"" the problem of his education, and his first and second tours of France, but these events are handled less extensively and are not as central to the text.) It takes six volumes to cover this chain of events, although comparatively few pages are spent in actually advancing such a simple plot. The story occurs as a series of accidents, all of which seem calculated to confound Walter Shandy's hopes and expectations for his son. The manner of his conception is the first disaster, followed by the flattening of his nose at birth, a misunderstanding in which he is given the wrong name, and an accidental run-in with a falling window-sash. The catastrophes that befall Tristram are actually relatively trivial; only in the context of Walter Shandy's eccentric, pseudo-scientific theories do they become calamities.
The second major plot consists of the fortunes of Tristram's Uncle Toby. Most of the details of this story are concentrated in the final third of the novel, although they are alluded to and developed in piecemeal fashion from the very beginning. Toby receives a wound to the groin while in the army, and it takes him four years to recover. When he is able to move around again, he retires to the country with the idea of constructing a scaled replica of the scene of the battle in which he was injured. He becomes obsessed with re-enacting those battles, as well as with the whole history and theory of fortification and defense. The Peace of Utrecht slows him down in these ""hobby-horsical"" activities, however, and it is during this lull that he falls under the spell of Widow Wadman. The novel ends with the long-promised account of their unfortunate affair."
Reflections,"In Common Sense, Thomas Paine argues for American independence. His argument begins with more general, theoretical reflections about government and religion, then progresses onto the specifics of the colonial situation.
Paine begins by distinguishing between government and society. Society, according to Paine, is everything constructive and good that people join together to accomplish. Government, on the other hand, is an institution whose sole purpose is to protect us from our own vices. Government has its origins in the evil of man and is therefore a necessary evil at best. Paine says that government's sole purpose is to protect life, liberty and property, and that a government should be judged solely on the basis of the extent to which it accomplishes this goal.
Paine then considers an imagined scenario in which a small group of people has been placed on an island, and cut off from the rest of society. In time, these people develop ties with one another, and lawmaking becomes inevitable. Paine says the people will be much happier if they are responsible for the creation of the laws that rule them. Paine is also implicitly arguing that such a system of representation is also better for the American colonists. Having expressed his disagreement with British reign in America, Paine proceeds to launch a general attack on the British system of government. Paine says the British system is too complex and rife with contradictions, and that the monarchy is granted far too much power. The British system pretends to offer a reasonable system of checks and balances, but in fact, it does not.
From here Paine moves on to discuss, in general, the notions of monarchy and hereditary succession. Man, Pain argues, was born into a state of equality, and the distinction that has arisen between king and subject is an unnatural one. At first, Paine says, the world was without kings, but the ancient Jews decided they wanted a king. This angered God, but he allowed them to have one. Paine presents pages of biblical evidence detailing God's wrath at the idea of the Jews having a king. The conclusion Paine reaches is that the practice of monarchy originates from sin, and is an institution that the Bible and God condemn. Paine calls hereditary succession an abominable practice. He says that even if people were to choose to have a king, that does not legitimize that King's child acting as a future ruler. Furthermore, hereditary succession has brought with it innumerable evils, such as incompetent kings, corruption, and civil war.
Having dispensed with the preliminary theoretical issues, Paine sets in to discuss the details of the American situation. In response to the argument that America has flourished under British rule, and therefore ought to stay under the king, Paine says that such an argument fails to realize that America has evolved and no longer needs Britain's help. Some say that Britain has protected America, and therefore deserves allegiance, but Paine responds that Britain has only watched over America in order to secure its own economic well-being. Paine adds that most recently, instead of watching over the colonies, the British have been attacking them, and are therefore undeserving of American loyalty.
Paine says that the colonies have little to gain from remaining attached to Britain. Commerce can be better conducted with the rest of Europe, but only after America becomes independent. Paine also asserts that if the colonies remain attached to Britain, the same problems that have arisen in the past will arise in the future. Paine argues that it is necessary to seek independence now, as to do otherwise would only briefly cover up problems that will surely reemerge.
Paine even proposes the form of government that the independent colonies should adopt. His recommendation is for a representative democracy that gives roughly equal weight to each of the colonies.
Paine explains why the current time is a good time to break free of Britain. Primarily, Paine focuses on the present size of the colonies, and on their current capabilities. He presents an inventory of the British Navy and gives calculations revealing how America could build a navy of comparable size. Paine recommends this as a way of ensuring America's security and prosperity in trade. Paine also argues that America is sufficiently small as to be united now. If time were to elapse, and the population of the colonies to grow, the same feeling of unity would not be present. Paine adds that if the Americans revolt now, they can use the vast expanses of uncharted land to the West in order to pay down some of the debt they will incur.
Paine says that as a colony of Britain, America lacks respectability on the international scene. They are seen simply as rebels, and cannot form substantial alliances with other nations. In order to prosper in the long term, the colonies need to be independent. Paine says that, by declaring independence, America will be able to ask for the help of other countries in its struggle for freedom. For all of these reasons, Paine says it is imperative and urgent that the colonies declare independence."
Sweeping,"Gregor Samsa, a traveling salesman, wakes up in his bed to find himself transformed into a large insect. He looks around his room, which appears normal, and decides to go back to sleep to forget about what has happened. He attempts to roll over, only to discover that he cannot due to his new body—he is stuck on his hard, convex back. He tries to scratch an itch on his stomach, but when he touches himself with one of his many new legs, he is disgusted. He reflects on how dreary life as a traveling salesman is and how he would quit if his parents and sister did not depend so much on his income. He turns to the clock and sees that he has overslept and missed his train to work.
Gregor’s mother knocks on the door, and when he answers her, Gregor finds that his voice has changed. His family suspects that he may be ill, so they ask him to open the door, which he keeps locked out of habit. He tries to get out of bed, but he cannot maneuver his transformed body. While struggling to move, he hears his office manager come into the family’s apartment to find out why Gregor has not shown up to work. He eventually rocks himself to the floor and calls out that he will open the door momentarily.
Through the door, the office manager warns Gregor of the consequences of missing work and hints that Gregor’s recent work has not been satisfactory. Gregor protests and tells the office manager that he will be there shortly. Neither his family nor the office manager can understand what Gregor says, and they suspect that something may be seriously wrong with him. Gregor manages to unlock and open the door with his mouth, since he has no hands. He begs the office manager’s forgiveness for his late start. Horrified by Gregor’s appearance, the office manager bolts from the apartment. Gregor tries to catch up with the fleeing office manager, but his father drives him back into the bedroom with a cane and a rolled newspaper. Gregor injures himself squeezing back through the doorway, and his father slams the door shut. Gregor, exhausted, falls asleep.
Gregor wakes and sees that someone has put milk and bread in his room. Initially excited, he quickly discovers that he has no taste for milk, once one of his favorite foods. He settles himself under a couch and listens to the quiet apartment. The next morning, his sister Grete comes in, sees that he has not touched the milk, and replaces it with rotting food scraps, which Gregor happily eats. This begins a routine in which his sister feeds him and cleans up while he hides under the couch, afraid that his appearance will frighten her. Gregor spends his time listening through the wall to his family members talking. They often discuss the difficult financial situation they find themselves in now that Gregor can’t provide for them. Gregor also learns that his mother wants to visit him, but his sister and father will not let her.
Gregor grows more comfortable with his changed body. He begins climbing the walls and ceiling for amusement. Discovering Gregor’s new pastime, Grete decides to remove some of the furniture to give Gregor more space. She and her mother begin taking furniture away, but Gregor finds their actions deeply distressing. He tries to save a picture on the wall of a woman wearing a fur hat, fur scarf, and a fur muff. Gregor’s mother sees him hanging on the wall and passes out. Grete calls out to Gregor—the first time anyone has spoken directly to him since his transformation. Gregor runs out of the room and into the kitchen. His father returns from his new job, and misunderstanding the situation, believes Gregor has tried to attack the mother. The father throws apples at Gregor, and one sinks into his back and remains lodged there. Gregor manages to get back into his bedroom but is severely injured.
Gregor’s family begins leaving the bedroom door open for a few hours each evening so he can watch them. He sees his family wearing down as a result of his transformation and their new poverty. Even Grete seems to resent Gregor now, feeding him and cleaning up with a minimum of effort. The family replaces their maid with a cheap cleaning lady who tolerates Gregor’s appearance and speaks to him occasionally. They also take on three boarders, requiring them to move excess furniture into Gregor’s room, which distresses Gregor. Gregor has also lost his taste for the food Grete brings and he almost entirely ceases eating.
One evening, the cleaning lady leaves Gregor’s door open while the boarders lounge about the living room. Grete has been asked to play the violin for them, and Gregor creeps out of his bedroom to listen. The boarders, who initially seemed interested in Grete, grow bored with her performance, but Gregor is transfixed by it. One of the boarders spots Gregor and they become alarmed. Gregor’s father tries to shove the boarders back into their rooms, but the three men protest and announce that they will move out immediately without paying rent because of the disgusting conditions in the apartment.
Grete tells her parents that they must get rid of Gregor or they will all be ruined. Her father agrees, wishing Gregor could understand them and would leave of his own accord. Gregor does in fact understand and slowly moves back to the bedroom. There, determined to rid his family of his presence, Gregor dies.
Upon discovering that Gregor is dead, the family feels a great sense of relief. The father kicks out the boarders and decides to fire the cleaning lady, who has disposed of Gregor’s body. The family takes a trolley ride out to the countryside, during which they consider their finances. Months of spare living as a result of Gregor’s condition have left them with substantial savings. They decide to move to a better apartment. Grete appears to have her strength and beauty back, which leads her parents to think about finding her a husband."
Elsewhere,"The Bottom is a mostly Black community in Ohio, situated in the hills above the mostly white, wealthier community of Medallion. The Bottom first became a community when a master gave it to his former slave. This ""gift"" was in fact a trick: the master gave the former slave a poor stretch of hilly land, convincing the slave the land was worthwhile by claiming that because it was hilly, it was closer to heaven. The trick, though, led to the growth of a vibrant community. Now the community faces a new threat; wealthy whites have taken a liking to the land, and would like to destroy much of the town in order to build a golf course.
Shadrack, a resident of the Bottom, fought in WWI. He returns a shattered man, unable to accept the complexities of the world; he lives on the outskirts of town, attempting to create order in his life. One of his methods involves compartmentalizing his fear of death in a ritual he invents and names National Suicide Day. The town is at first wary of him and his ritual, then, over time, unthinkingly accepts him.
Meanwhile, the families of the children Nel and Sula are contrasted. Nel is the product of a family that believes deeply in social conventions; hers is a stable home, though some might characterize it as rigid. Nel is uncertain of the conventional life her mother, Helene, wants for her; these doubts are hammered home when she meets Rochelle, her grandmother and a former prostitute, the only unconventional woman in her family line. Sula's family is very different: she lives with her grandmother, Eva, and her mother, Hannah, both of whom are seen by the town as eccentric and loose. Their house also serves as a home for three informally adopted boys and a steady stream of borders.
Despite their differences, Sula and Nel become fiercely attached to each other during adolescence. However, a traumatic accident changes everything. One day, Sula playfully swings a neighborhood boy, Chicken Little, around by his hands. When she loses her grip, the boy falls into a nearby river and drowns. They never tell anyone about the accident even though they did not intend to harm the boy. The two girls begin to grow apart. One day, in an accident, Sula's mother's dress catches fire and she dies of the burns.
After high school, Nel chooses to marry and settles into the conventional role of wife and mother. Sula follows a wildly divergent path and lives a life of fierce independence and total disregard for social conventions. Shortly after Nel's wedding, Sula leaves the Bottom for a period of 10 years. She has many affairs, some with white men. However, she finds people following the same boring routines elsewhere, so she returns to the Bottom and to Nel.
Upon her return, the town regards Sula as the very personification of evil for her blatant disregard of social conventions. Their hatred in part rests upon Sula's interracial relationships, but is crystallized when Sula has an affair with Nel's husband, Jude, who subsequently abandons Nel. Ironically, the community's labeling of Sula as evil actually improves their own lives. Her presence in the community gives them the impetus to live harmoniously with one another. Nel breaks off her friendship with Sula. Just before Sula dies in 1940, they achieve a half-hearted reconciliation. With Sula's death, the harmony that had reigned in the town quickly dissolves.
In 1965, with the Bottom facing the prospect of the white golf course, Nel visits Eva in the nursing home. Eva accuses her of sharing the guilt for Chicken Little's death. Her accusation forces Nel to confront the unfairness of her judgment against Sula. Nel admits to herself that she had blamed his death entirely on Sula and set herself up as the ""good"" half of the relationship. Nel comes to realize that in the aftermath of Chicken Little's death she had too quickly clung to social convention in an effort to define herself as ""good."" Nel goes to the cemetery and mourns at Sula's grave, calling out Sula's name in sadness.
Sula is a novel about ambiguity. It questions and examines the terms ""good"" and ""evil,"" often demonstrating that the two often resemble one another. The novel addresses the confusing mysteries of human emotions and relationships, ultimately concluding that social conventions are inadequate as a foundation for living one's life. The novel tempts the reader to apply the diametrically opposed terms of ""good and evil,"" ""right and wrong"" to the characters and their actions, and yet simultaneously shows why it is necessary to resist such temptation. While exploring the ways in which people try to make meaning of lives filled with conflicts over race, gender, and simple idiosyncratic points of views, Sula resists easy answers, demonstrating the ambiguity, beauty, and terror of life, in both its triumphs and horrors."
1815,"Although convinced that she herself will never marry, Emma Woodhouse, a precocious twenty-year-old resident of the village of Highbury, imagines herself to be naturally gifted in conjuring love matches. After self-declared success at matchmaking between her governess and Mr. Weston, a village widower, Emma takes it upon herself to find an eligible match for her new friend, Harriet Smith. Though Harriet’s parentage is unknown, Emma is convinced that Harriet deserves to be a gentleman’s wife and sets her friend’s sights on Mr. Elton, the village vicar. Meanwhile, Emma persuades Harriet to reject the proposal of Robert Martin, a well-to-do farmer for whom Harriet clearly has feelings.
	Harriet becomes infatuated with Mr. Elton under Emma’s encouragement, but Emma’s plans go awry when Elton makes it clear that his affection is for Emma, not Harriet. Emma realizes that her obsession with making a match for Harriet has blinded her to the true nature of the situation. Mr. Knightley, Emma’s brother-in-law and treasured friend, watches Emma’s matchmaking efforts with a critical eye. He believes that Mr. Martin is a worthy young man whom Harriet would be lucky to marry. He and Emma quarrel over Emma’s meddling, and, as usual, Mr. Knightley proves to be the wiser of the pair. Elton, spurned by Emma and offended by her insinuation that Harriet is his equal, leaves for the town of Bath and marries a girl there almost immediately.
	Emma is left to comfort Harriet and to wonder about the character of a new visitor expected in Highbury—Mr. Weston’s son, Frank Churchill. Frank is set to visit his father in Highbury after having been raised by his aunt and uncle in London, who have taken him as their heir. Emma knows nothing about Frank, who has long been deterred from visiting his father by his aunt’s illnesses and complaints. Mr. Knightley is immediately suspicious of the young man, especially after Frank rushes back to London merely to have his hair cut. Emma, however, finds Frank delightful and notices that his charms are directed mainly toward her. Though she plans to discourage these charms, she finds herself flattered and engaged in a flirtation with the young man. Emma greets Jane Fairfax, another addition to the Highbury set, with less enthusiasm. Jane is beautiful and accomplished, but Emma dislikes her because of her reserve and, the narrator insinuates, because she is jealous of Jane.
	Suspicion, intrigue, and misunderstandings ensue. Mr. Knightley defends Jane, saying that she deserves compassion because, unlike Emma, she has no independent fortune and must soon leave home to work as a governess. Mrs. Weston suspects that the warmth of Mr. Knightley’s defense comes from romantic feelings, an implication Emma resists. Everyone assumes that Frank and Emma are forming an attachment, though Emma soon dismisses Frank as a potential suitor and imagines him as a match for Harriet. At a village ball, Knightley earns Emma’s approval by offering to dance with Harriet, who has just been humiliated by Mr. Elton and his new wife. The next day, Frank saves Harriet from Gypsy beggars. When Harriet tells Emma that she has fallen in love with a man above her social station, Emma believes that she means Frank. Knightley begins to suspect that Frank and Jane have a secret understanding, and he attempts to warn Emma. Emma laughs at Knightley’s suggestion and loses Knightley’s approval when she flirts with Frank and insults Miss Bates, a kindhearted spinster and Jane’s aunt, at a picnic. When Knightley reprimands Emma, she weeps.
	News comes that Frank’s aunt has died, and this event paves the way for an unexpected revelation that slowly solves the mysteries. Frank and Jane have been secretly engaged; his attentions to Emma have been a screen to hide his true preference. With his aunt’s death and his uncle’s approval, Frank can now marry Jane, the woman he loves. Emma worries that Harriet will be crushed, but she soon discovers that it is Knightley, not Frank, who is the object of Harriet’s affection. Harriet believes that Knightley shares her feelings. Emma finds herself upset by Harriet’s revelation, and her distress forces her to realize that she is in love with Knightley. Emma expects Knightley to tell her he loves Harriet, but, to her delight, Knightley declares his love for Emma. Harriet is soon comforted by a second proposal from Robert Martin, which she accepts. The novel ends with the marriage of Harriet and Mr. Martin and that of Emma and Mr. Knightley, resolving the question of who loves whom after all."
Yielding,"Nine years after the start of the Trojan War, the Greek (“Achaean”) army sacks Chryse, a town allied with Troy. During the battle, the Achaeans capture a pair of beautiful maidens, Chryseis and Briseis. Agamemnon, the leader of the Achaean forces, takes Chryseis as his prize, and Achilles, the Achaeans’ greatest warrior, claims Briseis. Chryseis’s father, Chryses, who serves as a priest of the god Apollo, offers an enormous ransom in return for his daughter, but Agamemnon refuses to give Chryseis back. Chryses then prays to Apollo, who sends a plague upon the Achaean camp.
After many Achaeans die, Agamemnon consults the prophet Calchas to determine the cause of the plague. When he learns that Chryseis is the cause, he reluctantly gives her up but then demands Briseis from Achilles as compensation. Furious at this insult, Achilles returns to his tent in the army camp and refuses to fight in the war any longer. He vengefully yearns to see the Achaeans destroyed and asks his mother, the sea-nymph Thetis, to enlist the services of Zeus, king of the gods, toward this end. The Trojan and Achaean sides have declared a cease-fire with each other, but now the Trojans breach the treaty and Zeus comes to their aid.
With Zeus supporting the Trojans and Achilles refusing to fight, the Achaeans suffer great losses. Several days of fierce conflict ensue, including duels between Paris and Menelaus and between Hector and Ajax. The Achaeans make no progress; even the heroism of the great Achaean warrior Diomedes proves fruitless. The Trojans push the Achaeans back, forcing them to take refuge behind the ramparts that protect their ships. The Achaeans begin to nurture some hope for the future when a nighttime reconnaissance mission by Diomedes and Odysseus yields information about the Trojans’ plans, but the next day brings disaster. Several Achaean commanders become wounded, and the Trojans break through the Achaean ramparts. They advance all the way up to the boundary of the Achaean camp and set fire to one of the ships. Defeat seems imminent, because without the ships, the army will be stranded at Troy and almost certainly destroyed.
Concerned for his comrades but still too proud to help them himself, Achilles agrees to a plan proposed by Nestor that will allow his beloved friend Patroclus to take his place in battle, wearing his armor. Patroclus is a fine warrior, and his presence on the battlefield helps the Achaeans push the Trojans away from the ships and back to the city walls. But the counterattack soon falters. Apollo knocks Patroclus’s armor to the ground, and Hector slays him. Fighting then breaks out as both sides try to lay claim to the body and armor. Hector ends up with the armor, but the Achaeans, thanks to a courageous effort by Menelaus and others, manage to bring the body back to their camp. When Achilles discovers that Hector has killed Patroclus, he fills with such grief and rage that he agrees to reconcile with Agamemnon and rejoin the battle. Thetis goes to Mount Olympus and persuades the god Hephaestus to forge Achilles a new suit of armor, which she presents to him the next morning. Achilles then rides out to battle at the head of the Achaean army.
Meanwhile, Hector, not expecting Achilles to rejoin the battle, has ordered his men to camp outside the walls of Troy. But when the Trojan army glimpses Achilles, it flees in terror back behind the city walls. Achilles cuts down every Trojan he sees. Strengthened by his rage, he even fights the god of the river Xanthus, who is angered that Achilles has caused so many corpses to fall into his streams. Finally, Achilles confronts Hector outside the walls of Troy. Ashamed at the poor advice that he gave his comrades, Hector refuses to flee inside the city with them. Achilles chases him around the city’s periphery three times, but the goddess Athena finally tricks Hector into turning around and fighting Achilles. In a dramatic duel, Achilles kills Hector. He then lashes the body to the back of his chariot and drags it across the battlefield to the Achaean camp. Upon Achilles’ arrival, the triumphant Achaeans celebrate Patroclus’s funeral with a long series of athletic games in his honor. Each day for the next nine days, Achilles drags Hector’s body in circles around Patroclus’s funeral bier.
At last, the gods agree that Hector deserves a proper burial. Zeus sends the god Hermes to escort King Priam, Hector’s father and the ruler of Troy, into the Achaean camp. Priam tearfully pleads with Achilles to take pity on a father bereft of his son and return Hector’s body. He invokes the memory of Achilles’ own father, Peleus. Deeply moved, Achilles finally relents and returns Hector’s corpse to the Trojans. Both sides agree to a temporary truce, and Hector receives a hero’s funeral."
Pres,"Alex Claremont-Diaz is the 21-year-old son of Ellen Claremont, the first female president of the United States. Alex is highly ambitious, with his sights set on a career in politics like his mother and his father, who is a US senator. Alex is finishing his last year of college and living in the White House with his family, including his older sister June. As the novel opens, June and Alex discuss the British royal wedding, which they are about to attend, and Alex talks about how much he hates the groom’s younger brother, Prince Henry. When Alex was 12, he used to look repeatedly at a photo of Henry from one of June’s teen magazines. But when he met Henry in person, Henry was rude to him, and he’s disliked Henry ever since. At the wedding, Alex is focused on Prince Henry and is irritated by everything he does, especially when he asks June to dance for a photo opportunity. Drunk, Alex confronts Henry for acting superior, and the two end up in a physical altercation that topples the $75,000 royal wedding cake. The international incident is a scandal, and Alex is forced to pretend to be Henry’s close friend to squash rumors of a shaky relationship between the United States and Britain. 
Alex has no choice but to go along with the plan. As Alex and Henry spend more time together, however, Alex is continually surprised by Henry and finds that Henry is not at all what he expected. He’s especially moved when he sees Henry speaking warmly and openly to a young girl with cancer. Before Alex can talk to Henry about it, there’s a loud noise like gunshots, and the two are rushed into a supply closet by security. In the closet, Henry ends up apologizing for mistreating Alex in the past and says he was cold to Alex because his father had just died. Alex and Henry exchange phone numbers and start texting and talking on the phone. The Claremont-Diaz clan has a family dinner, and Ellen offers both Alex and June positions in her reelection campaign. Alex is thrilled, but June, who wants to be a journalist, declines the offer. 
Alex, June, and their best friend Nora, who is the granddaughter of the Vice President, throw their annual New Year’s Eve party. Henry attends with his best friend Pez, who is enamored of June. Everyone is having fun together, but when Henry sees Alex and Nora kiss at midnight, he gets jealous and leaves the party. Alex finds him in the garden, and Henry kisses him for the first time. This spurs a crisis of sexual identity in Alex, who can’t stop thinking about the kiss. Though Alex has had a sexual relationship with his high school friend Liam and been attracted to men, he’s never considered himself bisexual. He talks to Nora about his confusion, and she says that Henry is gay, and that Alex seems to have feelings for Henry. When Henry flies in for a dinner, Alex kisses him while a security guard keeps watch. That night, they have sex for the first time, and Alex says they are friends with benefits. Henry and Alex continue to meet up to have sex when they can get away. They also begin to write flirtatious emails to each other and have heart-to-hearts on the phone. After a night on the town with June, Nora, Henry, Pez, and Henry’s sister Bea, Alex begins to develop feelings for Henry. 
Since Alex's mother is running for reelection and because Henry is a royal, it’s crucial that Henry and Alex’s relationship remain a secret. Alex often turns to his mentor and family friend, Senator Rafael Luna, for advice to help his mother with her campaign. It’s a blow to the whole family when Luna comes out as the running mate for Ellen’s opponent, Jeffrey Richards. Alex is devastated, and Henry comes to visit Alex at the Democratic National Convention to comfort him. The next morning, Zahra, Ellen’s chief of staff and family friend, catches Henry and Alex together and agrees to keep it a secret until after the convention. Alex comes out to his mother, who creates a PowerPoint presentation as a means of talking about the dangers of his relationship with Henry. She tells him she’ll support him, but he needs to be sure the relationship is forever. He goes to his family’s lake house with Henry, June, Nora, and his father Oscar. Alex comes out to his father, too, and he realizes that he is in love with Henry. Just as he’s about to tell Henry how he feels, Henry suddenly becomes formal and fake and leaves the conversation. The next morning Henry leaves the lake house without saying goodbye, leaving only a note. 
When Henry stops responding to Alex’s texts, Alex is distraught. He flies to London to confront Henry. Henry says he can’t be in a relationship with Alex because of the royal family. They have sex, and neither of them is sure whether it is a goodbye or the beginning of their relationship. Henry gives Alex his signet ring and says he wants to be with Alex. They are happy to be together, and they send each other passionate emails when they are apart.
Suspicions about their relationship start coming out in the press, so Alex and Henry pretend to go on dates with Nora and June. It’s painful for Henry to pretend to be someone he isn’t. Then, Akex and Henry's relationship is leaked to the press, with photos of them together and their entire email history. They are both forced to go on a communication blackout, and Ellen’s team attempts to triage the situation. Alex is miserable and worried about Henry. Eventually, he flies to London. Alex and Bea help Henry confront his family, including his grandmother, the Queen. As the Queen argues that the world will never accept them, a group of people gathers outside the palace to express support for Alex and Henry’s love.

Courts,"As a huntress and her family’s primary source of survival, nineteen-year-old Feyre stalks the bleak woods, a little farther from home than usual. Her family was once very wealthy, but they now live in poverty. Feyre’s luck turns when she spots a deer. At the same time, an enormous wolf appears out of nowhere. Feyre wonders if the wolf is a faerie in disguise. She hates faeries for all the harm they have done to humans. Feyre decides to use a precious ash arrow, a surefire method to kill a faerie, just in case. She fires the arrow as the wolf attacks the deer, killing the beast. The next evening, a golden beast bursts through the door of her family’s rundown cottage. The beast reveals that the wolf was indeed a faerie named Andras. The beast demands payment for his death under the terms of the Treaty between the human and faerie realms. The beast gives Feyre a choice: he can kill her now, or she can follow him to the faerie realm of Prythian to live out the rest of her days. Feyre chooses to live. 
In Prythian, Feyre learns the golden beast is a High Fae called Tamlin. He is the High Lord of the Spring Court. Tamlin and all the faeries in his court wear permanent masks on their faces due to an affliction called the blight. At first, Feyre is determined to escape Prythian, but she soon becomes accustomed to her new home. She learns about its history and magic and that much of what she was raised to believe about faeries, including their inability to lie and their aversion to iron, are myths. Feyre develops an affection for Alis, her lady-in-waiting, and Lucien, Tamlin’s best friend. Tamlin encourages her to explore her love for painting and to improve her reading skills. He reveals that he has ensured her family is well cared for in the human realm. Romantic and sexual tension grows between them. Although Feyre finds Prythian beautiful, it is full of dangerous creatures and intrigue. The blight makes life in Prythian increasingly perilous. After a threatening visit from a High Fae named Rhysand, Tamlin believes Feyre is no longer safe in Prythian and decides to send her back to the human realm. The night before she leaves, they make love. Tamlin tells Feyre that he loves her. Though she loves him too, she cannot bring herself to speak the words aloud.  
Feyre returns to the human realm to find that Tamlin was true to his word. Her family is extremely wealthy and well cared for. Her father and sisters have been glamoured, or tricked with faerie magic, and know nothing about faeries or how their wealth was restored. They believe Feyre has been away caring for a sick aunt. Soon, her sister Nesta reveals the glamour did not work on her. After Feyre was taken to Prythian, Nesta searched for her but was unable to cross the wall between the human and faerie realms. Nesta also reveals she is still angry at their father for not trying harder to save their mother’s life. Nesta’s words inspire Feyre to fight harder for Tamlin and she sets off for Prythian to fight the blight alongside him.  
When Feyre arrives at the Spring Court, Tamlin’s manor house is in shambles. Alis is the only one left. Alis reveals that the blight is a euphemism that refers to Amarantha, the High Queen of Prythian. Amarantha is an interloper who took Prythian over by force. She stole the powers of the High Fae and placed a curse on Tamlin that could only be broken by a woman who hated the fae declaring her love for him. Since Feyre never told Tamlin she loved him, the curse remained. The curse prevented the faeries from telling Feyre the truth, so they used the blight to explain their masks and other conflicts. Alis can tell Feyre this because Amarantha has relaxed part of the curse, believing she’s already won, but there is still one aspect of the curse Alis cannot reveal. When Alis explains that Tamlin and Lucien are Amarantha’s captives, Feyre decides to go after them. 
Feyre journeys to Amarantha’s faerie court Under the Mountain, where she becomes a captive as well. Amarantha gives her the chance to save Tamlin by completing three tasks or by solving a riddle. For the first task, Feyre uses her hunting skills to escape a giant worm in a labyrinth. As the faeries place bets and watch in amusement, the only one to bet on Feyre is Rhysand. After, he heals her broken arm. In exchange, Feyre agrees to spend a week every month with him in the Night Court. For the second task, Feyre must successfully solve a puzzle and choose the right lever or she and Lucien will be impaled and crushed. She makes the correct choice with the aid of Rhysand’s voice in her head. In the meantime, Rhysand parades Feyre around as his escort at parties. 
For the third task, Feyre must stab three faeries in the heart with ash wood daggers. Despite her guilt, she knows it’s the only way to break the curse. She stabs the first two faeries, but when the hood is removed from the third one, it is Tamlin. At first, Feyre believes she must kill the man she loves until she remembers two conversations about Tamlin’s heart of stone. She believes this means Tamlin’s heart is literally made of stone so he cannot be harmed by the dagger. Knowing Amarantha wants Tamlin for herself and doesn’t want to see him killed, Feyre plunges the dagger into Tamlin’s chest. She is correct, but Amarantha refuses to break the curse based on a technicality. In a rage, Amarantha beats Feyre almost to death. Feyre finally realizes the answer to Amarantha’s riddle is the word love. She speaks the solution aloud and the curse breaks just as Feyre dies. With the curse broken, Tamlin and Rhysand join forces to destroy Amarantha. One by one, the six High Lords gift Feyre with healing light and immortality. Tamlin sets a bit of this golden light on her heart, resurrecting Feyre and transforming her into one of the High Fae. Feyre and Tamlin are finally free, but Feyre must reckon with her new life and the lives she took to bring them to this point."
Schemes,"Each chapter of Chains opens with a date ranging from May 27, 1776, to January 19, 1777, and a quotation from a document of the time. Since the novel uses the voice of the protagonist, Isabel, it reads much like a diary. The story opens with the funeral of Mary Finch, slave owner of Isabel and her sister Ruth and former owner of their deceased mother. Mary’s nephew, Robert, sells Isabel and Ruth to a couple from New York City, the Locktons, devout Tories who scorn the American Revolution and the rebels fighting against the king. Throughout the novel, people loyal to Britain call those fighting for independence “rebels,” while the men and women fighting to be free from Britain’s rule call themselves “patriots.” 
Isabel and Ruth travel from Rhode Island to New York by boat. At the dock, Madam Lockton hits Isabel, the first of many blows. Ruth, age five, is simple-minded, so Madam keeps her near and dressed like a pretty toy, while she works Isabel hard. Isabel promised their Momma that she would always protect Ruth. Isabel meets and becomes friends with Curzon, slave to patriot Mr. Bellingham. Curzon proposes that Isabel work for the patriots by spying on the Locktons in exchange for her freedom since Isabel might overhear secret plans. Madam’s cruelty convinces Isabel to join the patriot cause.
Becky Berry, a white servant, and Lady Seymour, Mr. Lockton’s aunt, both show kindness toward Isabel and Ruth. Isabel learns that money hidden in the Locktons’ wooden crate will pay patriots to switch sides, information valuable to the patriot leaders. This scheme and the plot to assassinate George Washington lead to Lockton’s arrest, but Isabel’s role is not suspected. Each day, Isabel fetches water from the Tea Water Pump, a gathering place for slaves, and meets a kind Grandfather who gives her good advice. Grandfather often speaks of “crossing the River Jordan” as a metaphor symbolizing each slave’s path to personal freedom.
When Madam witnesses Ruth’s seizure, she immediately wants to sell her, and Isabel realizes that the list of conspirators in the library drawer could be their ticket to escape. Isabel goes straight to Colonel Regan in the patriot headquarters, who gives her the code for future visits. As the Tories’ plans are uncovered, Lockton flees the city, leaving his wife behind. Isabel and Ruth attend the public hanging of the man blamed for the assassination plot, and the British plant their navy in the harbor, preparing for war. The patriots officially declare their independence, and the city fills with soldiers.
Madam sells Ruth, or so she says, which so infuriates Isabel that she angrily confronts Madam, an act that incites injury and Isabel’s escape. Isabel runs to Colonel Regan, who cannot help her, and she is dragged to a dungeon. After three hellish days, a judge sentences Isabel to be branded with an “I” on her cheek for Insolence. The branding is so painful Isabel loses consciousness for days and wakes in Lady Seymour’s house, nursed back to health, fed, and cleaned, her cheek still burning. Isabel must return to Madam and spends the next weeks in deep sadness, ignoring Curzon and wishing ill on Colonel Regan.
Violent thunderstorms hit New York City. Curzon has joined the patriot soldiers, who lose the Battle of Brooklyn and retreat. When the British invade New York, Isabel decides to work for them instead, hoping she’ll earn her freedom this way. She reports the location of Washington’s headquarters to a British officer, hoping he will help her escape, but he cannot. Lockton returns, and the Tories celebrate victory. When the Locktons and Lady Seymour accept British and Hussein soldiers into their homes, Isabel goes to Lady Seymour’s to help her care for them.
When the Great Fire hits New York, Isabel helps Lady Seymour escape, but Lady Seymour suffers great injury and her home is destroyed, so she moves in with the Locktons, along with more British soldiers and their wives, who take over the household chores. The British capture Fort Washington and march the surviving rebels to the prison, including Curzon. As Madam holds a feast to celebrate, Isabel overhears more plans, including hopes that thousands of prisoners would starve or die of disease. As Isabel carries a bowl of food scraps to the yard, she devises a plan.
Isabel begins to visit the prison regularly, delivering food and checking on Curzon, who has been shot. She earns the trust of a guard and a patriot leader. She nurses Lady Seymour, who supports her helping the prisoners. A shop owner gives Isabel a copy of Common Sense. Isabel carries messages between the prison and patriot officers at a huge risk to herself.
On Christmas, Isabel takes a long walk near the waterfront. Madam discovers that she’s been visiting the prison and forbids her from continuing to do so, so Isabel decides she must act. That evening, Isabel bakes a bread pudding and gifts it to a family in the burned part of the city, keeping Christmas the way her Momma did. A few days later, when Captain Morse asks Isabel to deliver a message to the prisoners informing them that Washington defeated the British in Trenton, she hears the prisoners cheer with joy. Afraid for his safety, Lockton flees to England. Lady Seymour apologizes to Isabel for not protecting her more and buying her herself, but Isabel cannot forgive her. When the prison guard offers Isabel work cleaning out the cells, she wonders if it’s an opportunity to pay for her freedom.
The city plans a celebration of the queen’s birthday, including dancing, fireworks, and feasting. Lady Seymour has suffered a stroke, which has left her unable to move or speak. On the day of the ball, Captain Morse asks Isabel to deliver a coin to another officer. That officer gives Isabel a note for Captain Morse, which she puts in her pocket. At home, Madam is furious because someone told her that her slave, Isabel, is passing notes for the rebels. When Madam demands the note, Isabel tosses it into the fire, inciting Madam’s wrath. In her fury, Madam lets it slip that she still owns Ruth, who has been living in Charleston, and then she locks Isabel in the cellar. Soon, Isabel escapes, determined to find Ruth. She writes herself a pass in the library, naming herself Isabel Gardener. Lady Seymour lets her take coins to aid her flight and whispers, “Run!”
Isabel runs to the prison, claiming to be there to clean, and finds Curzon in very bad shape. She hides him in a wheelbarrow and wheels him outside. She practically carries him to the waterfront, where they must pass a group of British soldiers. As they do, fireworks from the queen’s ball light the sky and distract the soldiers. Isabel steals a boat and rows herself and Curzon to New Jersey with bleeding and frozen hands. She wakes on the other side, knowing that they are free."
Inflict,"In “moon,” the first of the four parts of feed, an American teenager named Titus travels to the lunar surface with his high-school friends for spring break, hoping to escape the boredom they feel on Earth. No specific date is revealed, though it’s sometime in a dystopic future, where the moon is fully commercialized and people suffer from red sores called lesions. As Titus and his fellow upper-class friends Link, Marty, Calista, Loga, and Quendy arrive on the moon, readers also get their first glimpse of “the feed.” Although Titus doesn’t initially reveal exact details about the feed or how it works, he says it sends the friends ads and images for where to stay and shop. 
After failing to get into college-age parties, the group visits the Ricochet Lounge, where Titus becomes infatuated with a girl named Violet. She is beautiful and, he soon finds, visiting the moon by herself and is very unlike his friends: She doesn’t make pointless purchases at a mall they all soon visit and isn’t interested in malfunctioning, or falling into a drug-like stupor, via their connections to the feed. Later, when they all visit a dance club called the Rumble Spot, an old man from a dissenter group called the Coalition of Pity hacks into people’s individual feeds, causing them to broadcast the signal, “we enter a time of calamity” over the feed’s network. Police beat the man and “shut off” those hacked, including Titus and Violet, who hold hands as they collapse.
Part 2, “eden,” occurs in a lunar hospital where Violet, Titus, and his friends remain disconnected from the feed until their systems can be scanned for viruses. There, Titus provides additional details about what the feed is and how it works. Feeds are implanted inside the body and connect to a global network that provides news, entertainment, and a means to purchase every kind of product, he says while singing its praises. The feed even anticipates and creates users’ wants from individual profiles based on purchasing decisions, thoughts, and feelings. Titus and Violet grow closer during the stay. Violet, who’s home-schooled and smarter than Titus and his friends, says she hoped to enjoy herself like normal kids but now has a problem, though she remains vague about what this problem is. When doctors finally restore the friends’ feeds, they rejoice. Promotions begin to flow through their minds again, though there’s also ominous news concerning protests over America’s annexation of the moon and resulting anger from a group called the Global Alliance. Still, Titus says, the friends exalt in the return of their feeds.
In Part 3, “Utopia,” Titus and his friends return to Earth and life returns to normal for them: “upcars” travel in tubes past vertically stacked suburbs, the friends party, and U.S. President Trumbull scoffs at reports that claim toxic industries cause lesions. In defiance of rampant consumerism and a loss of individuality, Violet determines to resist the feed by creating a completely random customer profile and asks Titus to join her. Violet, who didn’t receive her feed until she was seven, voices deep concern about the decline of the world and destruction of Earth, and laments how those who’ve had the feed their entire lives are ignorant and self-centered. Titus soon has nightmares that are more likely hacks from the Coalition of Pity. In them, he sees disturbing images of eco destruction and human suffering around the world, but after Violet chats him, saying she has seen the images too, he only wants to go back to sleep.
Before long, Violet’s problem becomes clear: Her body begins to fail and she’s told by doctors that the damage to her feedware can be fatal. The prognosis makes Violet realize how much she wants to do. She starts by going to the seashore with Titus, though they need to dress in protective suits due to its toxicity. Meanwhile, feed chatter reveals that all of Earth’s forests have fallen and there is a growing rift between the U.S. and the Global Alliance. At a party where Quendy shows off her artificial lesions, Violet becomes outraged and her body falters. She chastises Titus and his friends for living in ignorance as the world dies, then collapses and is brought to the hospital. 
Violet’s condition declines further in Part 4, “slumberland,” whose chapter titles track her feed efficiency from a high of 87.3 percent to a low of 4.6 percent, 98 percent being optimal. Aware that she doesn’t have much time, Violet messages Titus a list of twenty-two things she wants to do in life, though he grows increasingly distant, and doesn’t message back. When they do reconnect, Violet sends Titus a recent memory where she falls down a staircase and receives a response from the corporation FeedTech, denying her petition to pay for her system repairs because she wasn’t deemed to be worthy due to her random customer profile. Violet later sends Titus childhood memories to preserve her history, though he deletes them. And when Violet convinces him to visit the mountains with her, one of her life goals, Titus breaks up with her, saying he was only interested in a short relationship while she wanted something eternal. 
Time passes and Titus eventually hears from Violet’s father. At Violet’s home, Titus sees her lying on a floating bed, completely pale, fully incapacitated, and covered in discs. Her father details her final, painful days and how her body failed. He then berates Titus for how badly he treated Violet and for willfully living in ignorance. Titus later visits Violet’s home a second time. Although she appears dead, her feed efficiency is at 4.6 percent and a screen shows that her heart is beating slightly. Nevertheless, Titus tells Violet a story he plans to keep telling her, he says, so she will remember herself. The story is about Violet, the end of America, and their relationship, where they learn something important about love and how to resist the feed. The book ends with a promotion on the feed for Blue-Jean Warehouse’s Final Sales Event and a recurring, fading message that “Everything must go.”"
Confronts,"Irene Redfield is a light-skinned Black woman who, in public places, occasionally passes for white, when she finds it convenient. Irene is a practical, determined person. She was born and raised in Chicago but now lives in Harlem with her husband, Brian, and their two boys. Brian is a successful doctor but dislikes his work. He would have preferred to move the entire family to another, less racist country long ago, but Irene has always insisted that the family belongs in New York.
One day, while back in Chicago for a visit, Irene has a chance meeting with a childhood friend, Clare. Clare is very different from Irene—self-centered, melodramatic, and reckless. Clare is even lighter-skinned than Irene, and in fact she has married a white man, John Bellew, without telling him that she is Black. They have a daughter. The Bellews live mostly in Europe but often spend time in the Unites States, depending on where John Bellew’s work in international banking takes him. Irene finds Clare strangely fascinating but does not like her company. She only reluctantly agrees to visit Clare at the Bellews’ hotel suite. Clare has invited a mutual light-skinned friend of theirs to join them. When John Bellew arrives, Irene is shocked to learn that he is a vehement racist. He openly declares that he hates Black people, not knowing that he is speaking to three of them.
Two years later, the Bellews have relocated to New York. Clare resumes contact with Irene, and Irene is not firm enough to insist that Clare leave her alone, if only to keep Clare’s secret safe. When Clare learns that Irene is planning a charity event at which upper-class Black people and white people will mingle, Clare insists on attending. Soon, she is at the Redfields’ home regularly and has become part of their social circle. In time, Irene suspects that Clare and Brian are having an affair. The Bellews are due to move back to Europe soon, but a chance downtown encounter between John Bellew and Irene, while Irene is with a darker-skinned friend, creates a crisis. If Bellew deduces that Clare, like Irene, is Black, he may divorce Clare and leave her free to pursue Brian.
The threat that Clare poses for Irene’s marriage and family life is unexpectedly removed when Bellew tracks Clare down at an all-Black party hosted by friends of the Redfields in their apartment atop a high residential building. Bellew angrily confronts Clare, but Clare smiles and acts unconcerned. When Irene angrily moves toward Clare and puts her hand on Clare’s arm, Clare tumbles out a nearby open window, to her death. The cause of her fall is unclear—whether she fainted and fell by accident, or fell deliberately. It is also possible that Irene pushed Clare, but no one accuses her."
Met,"A Wrinkle in Time is the story of Meg Murry, a high-school-aged girl who is transported on an adventure through time and space with her younger brother Charles Wallace and her friend Calvin O'Keefe to rescue her father, a gifted scientist, from the evil forces that hold him prisoner on another planet. At the beginning of the book, Meg is a homely, awkward, but loving girl, troubled by personal insecurities and her concern for her father, who has been missing for over a year. The plot begins with the arrival of Mrs. Whatsit at the Murry house on a dark and stormy evening. Although she looks like an eccentric tramp, she is actually a celestial creature with the ability to read Meg's thoughts. She startles Meg's mother by reassuring her of the existence of a tesseract--a sort of ""wrinkle"" in space and time. It is through this wrinkle that Meg and her companions will travel through the fifth dimension in search of Mr. Murry.
On the afternoon following Mrs. Whatsit's visit, Meg and Charles Wallace walk over to Mrs. Whatsit's cabin. On the way, they meet Calvin O'Keefe, a popular boy in Meg's school whom Charles considers a kindred spirit. The three children learn from Mrs. Whatsit and her friends Mrs. Who and Mrs. Which that the universe is threatened by a great evil called the Dark Thing and taking the form of a giant cloud, engulfing the stars around it. Several planets have already succumbed to this evil force, including Camazotz, the planet on which Mr. Murry is imprisoned.
The three Mrs. W's transport the children to Camazotz and instruct them to remain always in each other's company while on their quest for Mr. Murry. On Camazotz, all objects and places appear exactly alike because the whole planet must conform to the terrifying rhythmic pulsation of IT, a giant disembodied brain. Charles Wallace tries to fight IT with his exceptional intelligence but is overpowered by the evil and becomes a robot-like creature mouthing the words with which IT infuses him. Under the control of IT, Charles leads Meg and Calvin to Mr. Murry and together they confront IT. However, they, too, are unable to withstand IT's power; they escape only at the last minute, when Mr. Murry appears and seizes Meg and Calvin, ""tessering"" away with them (traveling via another tesseract) to a gray planet called Ixchel inhabited by tall, furry beasts who care for the travelers. Charles Wallace remains possessed by IT, a prisoner of Camazotz.
On Planet Ixchel the three Mrs. W's appear once again, and Meg realizes that she must travel alone back to Camazotz to rescue her brother. Mrs. Which tells her that she has one thing that IT does not have, and this will be her weapon against the evil. However, Meg must discover this weapon for herself. When standing in the presence of IT, Meg realizes what this is: her ability to love. Thus, by concentrating on her love for Charles Wallace, she is able to restore him to his true identity. Meg releases Charles from IT's clutches and tessers with him through time and space, landing in her twin brothers' vegetable garden on Earth, where her father and Calvin stand waiting. The family joyously reunites, and the Mrs. W's visit the happy scene en route to further travels."
Access,"Refugee follows the stories of three different children and their families, each attempting to flee their violent homelands, in different regions of the world and during different decades. Josef and his family flee Nazi Germany in 1938; Isabel and her family flee Cuba in 1994; and Mahmoud and his family flee Syria in 2015.
Josef Landau is a twelve-year-old boy living in Berlin. In 1938, his home is raided by Nazi storm troopers, and his father is taken to the Dachau concentration camp. Six months later, his mother receives a telegram that her husband has been released, but the family must leave Germany immediately. Josef, his sister Ruth, and his mother all travel to Hamburg to board a ship that will take them to Cuba. When Josef’s father is reunited with his family, they notice that Dachau has changed him: he is paranoid and very thin. They board the St. Louis, a large German ship, and set out.
Aboard the St. Louis, Josef’s family and the other passengers, all Jewish refugees, are treated well by Captain Schroeder and most of the ship’s crew. A few of the crew, however, openly dislike the Jewish passengers, especially Otto Schiendick, who proudly states his Nazi allegiance. When the St. Louis reaches Havana Harbor in Cuba, the ship is not allowed to dock. Josef’s father’s mental state deteriorates further, and he eventually jumps from the ship, trying to kill himself. Officer Padron, a Cuban policeman assigned to the St. Louis, saves Josef’s father. Josef’s father is taken to Havana to recover. When Officer Padron returns to the St. Louis, he is treated like a hero by the Jewish passengers. 
Eventually, the captain announces that they are not going to be allowed to dock in Havana and that the boat will be leaving. He promises the passengers that he will try to deliver them to a country other than Germany. The refugees aboard the St. Louis are delivered to England, Belgium, the Netherlands, and France. The Nazis invade France just a few months after Josef’s family arrives there. When the family is eventually caught, Josef’s mother is forced to choose which of her children will be freed and which will be sent to a concentration camp.
Isabel Fernandez is an eleven-year-old girl who lives just outside Havana in 1994. After the fall of the Soviet Union, Cuba has become inhospitable for most of its citizens under the regime of Fidel Castro. Isabel’s best friend and neighbor, Iván, is building a small boat with his father so that his family can flee to America. After a riot in Havana, Isabel’s family decides that they should also leave Cuba immediately. Isabel trades her trumpet to a fisherman for gasoline, paying her family’s way onto Iván’s family’s boat. Lito, Isabel’s grandfather, also joins them. 
The two families face many challenges as they try to cross the Caribbean Sea to Florida. A storm sweeps them to the Bahamas, where they are not allowed to disembark; Iván is attacked by sharks and eventually bleeds to death in the boat; and toward the end of the journey, Isabel’s pregnant mother goes into labor. Lito tells the story of the St. Louis and how he had to turn away so many refugees when he was a young policeman. (He is Officer Padron from Josef’s story.) Just when Miami becomes visible on the horizon, a U.S. Coast Guard boat tries to intercept the two families. Lito jumps in the water to distract the Coast Guard, and Isabel’s mother gives birth to a boy, just as they reach the shore. When Isabel is asked to play a song at her new school in America, she plays a Cuban salsa version of “The Star-Spangled Banner.”
Mahmoud Bishara is a twelve-year-old boy who lives in Aleppo, Syria in 2015. For the last few years, there has been a war in his country between the Syrian government, rebels, the Soviets, the United States and several other factions. After Mahmoud’s home is destroyed, his brother Waleed, sister Hana, and his parents drive to the border of Turkey, hoping to escape. Mahmoud’s father tells them that Germany is accepting Syrian refugees and if they can get to Greece, they will be able to travel within the European Union to reach Germany. After a violent conflict between the rebels and the Syrian government, Mahmoud and his family walk to the Turkish border. Mahmoud’s father arranges for a smuggler to take them to the island of Lesbos, in Greece. The smuggler’s raft is destroyed by rocks as they cross the Mediterranean. Mahmoud hands his sister, Hana, to another passing raft of refugees, knowing that his mother cannot hold her and swim. The family is eventually pulled from the water by the Greek Coast Guard. 
Mahmoud and his family travel through Serbia and into Hungary, where they are detained at a refugee camp that is built like a prison. Mahmoud decides that he no longer wants to be ignored and leads the refugees out of the prison, walking twelve hours to Austria. The refugees are welcomed in Austria, and Mahmoud’s family takes a train to Germany. While they travel, they ask if anyone has seen Hana. After a few weeks in Munich, Mahmoud’s family is transferred to a host family in Berlin. An elderly couple, Herr and Frau Rosenberg, welcome them into their home. Frau Rosenberg takes Mahmoud aside and tells him the story of her childhood: she is Ruth, Josef’s sister. The night that they were captured in France, Josef volunteered to be taken by the Nazis; both Josef and their mother were killed in concentration camps. Ruth promises to help Mahmoud find Hana."
Bargain,"Shabanu lives with her mother, father, older sister, grandfather, aunt, and young cousins in a compound of mud huts near the border between Pakistan and India. They own a herd of fine camels, and as long as there is water in the nearby pond (called a ""toba""), they live a proud and free existence in the windswept desert of Pakistan. Once a year, they attend a fair in Sibi, which lies across the desert and where they sell their camels in order to buy goods they need. When the toba dries up, they move to nearby villages with deep wells. When this happens, they wait eagerly for rain to fill the toba, which will allow them to move back to their beloved desert home.
Shabanu regards her older sister, Phulan, with disdain and envy. Phulan is beautiful and graceful. Her parents have promised her to a young man, Hamir, in a nearby farming village. The wedding will take place in the summer, when the monsoon rains come. Shabanu has been promised to this young man's brother, Murad, but as she is younger, her wedding is still far off. Shabanu loves her life in the desert. Her parents are gentle and indulgent. She adores the camels of their herd. She is especially proud of Guluband, a great and intelligent beast, who dances when he hears music.
Shabanu and her father travel across the desert lands to the fair at Sibi. Their sales at Sibi this year are especially important, as they will help pay for Phulan's dowry. At Sibi, Guluband is by far the best camel. Many people want to buy him, but Dadi refuses to sell him. An Afghani soldier, who will subject the poor camel to the conditions of war, shows special interest in Guluband. Dadi names an exorbitant price, and the man storms off. Dadi sells the rest of the herd quite successfully. However, the next day, the soldier returns with all the money for which Dadi had asked. Dadi must sell him the camel. Shabanu feels betrayed and crushed.
Dadi and Shabanu return home. The family prepares for the wedding by buying and sewing beautiful clothes and making a pilgrimage to Channan Pir. Women pray for sons and good marriages at this holy shrine. At Channan Pir, the women of the family meet Mama's bold cousin, Sharma, and her daughter, Fatima. Sharma left her abusive husband for a simple but independent existence in the desert, raising goats and sheep. Shabanu looks up to Sharma and often wishes that she could steal away to live a wild and free life in the desert with Sharma and Fatima. Sharma loves Shabanu, but she insists that Shabanu is lucky to be betrothed to such a gentle and upstanding young man.
When they return from Channan Pir, a dust storm whirls up. Grandfather, who is old and often unaware of his surroundings, wanders off into the storm before anyone notices. When they find him the next morning, he is near death. He begs them to take him to Derawar, a fort where he will receive a burial befitting a soldier. The family travels to Derawar, but eventually must bury him in a humble grave at the edges of town. As the dust storm has filled the toba, the family sets out for Mehrabpur, where Hamir's family lives.
Hamir's family bought their patch of land from a greedy landowner named Nazir Mohammad. The family labored over the land and it became rich and fertile. Nazir Mohammad is trying to force the family to give him part of their crops, claiming they did not actually buy the land from him. One evening, Shabanu and Phulan are fetching water when they come across Nazir Mohammad and his friends. They see the girls and plan to take Phulan and rape her. Shabanu throws the water pots at the men, sweeps Phulan up onto a camel, and rides home. Dadi sends the women off toward Derawar, fearful of Nazir Mohammad. He runs to tell Hamir what has happened. Hamir becomes violently angry, and when Nazir Mohammad appears shortly thereafter, Hamir attempts to shoot him. Nazir Mohammad kills Hamir.
The Desert Rangers find the women and take them to a nearby post, where the families will gather to settle the dispute. Nazir Mohammad's brother, Rahim- sahib, is a politician and wants to settle the dispute quickly. At the ranger post, Hamir's family, Shabanu's family, and Rahim- sahib talk far into the night. The next day, they announce the settlement: Phulan will marry Murad right away, Nazir Mohammad will leave the family alone, and Rahim-sahib, who met Shabanu briefly in the courtyard, will take Shabanu as his fourth wife.
Shabanu is devastated. She numbly endures Phulan's wedding. Sharma, however, draws her aside. She counsels Shabanu to learn to manipulate and control the doting man, to remain true to herself, to keep her heart hidden from him, and, if all else fails, to escape and join her and Fatima in the desert.
After the wedding, the family returns to their home in the desert. Shabanu tries to reconcile herself to her future. When her period starts, she hides it from her parents, as she knows she must marry soon after. When her father finds out she has hidden something from him, he is livid: her secretive and rebellious behavior does not befit a woman. Shabanu quickly decides to leave for Sharma's that very night.
When her parents are asleep, she slips out and climbs atop a camel. One of her favorite young camels insists on following her. She rides all night and is almost assured of freedom, when the young camel falls and breaks his leg. She knows that if she leaves the camel, predators will attack and kill him. Rather than leave him, she waits, knowing Dadi will find them in a few hours. When he does, he beats her violently. Shabanu stands silently under his attack. She resigns herself to her fate, but she carefully guards her inner happiness in her heart."
Correctly,"Meursault, the narrator, is a young man living in Algiers. After receiving a telegram informing him of his mother’s death, he takes a bus to Marengo, where his mother had been living in an old persons’ home. He sleeps for almost the entire trip. When he arrives, he speaks to the director of the home. The director allows Meursault to see his mother, but Meursault finds that her body has already been sealed in the coffin. He declines the caretaker’s offer to open the coffin.
That night, Meursault keeps vigil over his mother’s body. Much to his displeasure, the talkative caretaker stays with him the whole time. Meursault smokes a cigarette, drinks coffee, and dozes off. The next morning, before the funeral, he meets with the director again. The director informs him that Thomas Perez, an old man who had grown very close to Meursault’s mother, will be attending the funeral service. The funeral procession heads for the small local village, but Perez has difficulty keeping up and eventually faints from the heat. Meursault reports that he remembers little of the funeral. That night, he happily arrives back in Algiers.
The next day, Meursault goes to the public beach for a swim. There, he runs into Marie Cardona, his former co-worker. The two make a date to see a comedy at the movie theater that evening. After the movie they spend the night together. When Meursault wakes up, Marie is gone. He stays in bed until noon and then sits on his balcony until evening, watching the people pass on the street.
The following day, Monday, Meursault returns to work. He has lunch with his friend Emmanuel and then works all afternoon. While walking upstairs to his apartment that night, Meursault runs into Salamano, an old man who lives in his building and owns a mangy dog. Meursault also runs into his neighbor, Raymond Sintes, who is widely rumored to be a pimp. Raymond invites Meursault over for dinner. Over the meal, Raymond recounts how he beat up his mistress after he discovered that she had been cheating on him. As a result, he got into a fight with her brother. Raymond now wants to torment his mistress even more, but he needs Meursault to write a letter to lure his mistress back to him. Meursault agrees and writes the letter that night.
The following Saturday, Marie visits Meursault at his apartment. She asks Meursault if he loves her, and he replies that “it didn’t mean anything,” but probably not. The two then hear shouting coming from Raymond’s apartment. They go out into the hall and watch as a policeman arrives. The policeman slaps Raymond and says that he will be summoned to the police station for beating up his mistress. Later, Raymond asks Meursault to testify on his behalf, and Meursault agrees. That night, Raymond runs into Salamano, who laments that his dog has run away.
Marie asks Meursault if he wants to marry her. He replies indifferently but says that they can get married if she wants to, so they become engaged. The following Sunday, Meursault, Marie, and Raymond go to a beach house owned by Masson, one of Raymond’s friends. They swim happily in the ocean and then have lunch. That afternoon, Masson, Raymond, and Meursault run into two Arabs on the beach, one of whom is the brother of Raymond’s mistress. A fight breaks out and Raymond is stabbed. After tending to his wounds, Raymond returns to the beach with Meursault. They find the Arabs at a spring. Raymond considers shooting them with his gun, but Meursault talks him out of it and takes the gun away. Later, however, Meursault returns to the spring to cool off, and, for no apparent reason, he shoots Raymond’s mistress’s brother.
Meursault is arrested and thrown into jail. His lawyer seems disgusted at Meursault’s lack of remorse over his crime, and, in particular, at Meursault’s lack of grief at his mother’s funeral. Later, Meursault meets with the examining magistrate, who cannot understand Meursault’s actions. The magistrate brandishes a crucifix and demands that Meursault put his faith in God. Meursault refuses, insisting that he does not believe in God. The magistrate cannot accept Meursault’s lack of belief, and eventually dubs him “Monsieur Antichrist.”
One day, Marie visits Meursault in prison. She forces herself to smile during the visit, and she expresses hope that Meursault will be acquitted and that they will get married. As he awaits his trial, Meursault slowly adapts to prison life. His isolation from nature, women, and cigarettes torments him at first, but he eventually adjusts to living without them, and soon does not even notice their absence. He manages to keep his mind occupied, and he sleeps for most of each day.
Meursault is taken to the courthouse early on the morning of his trial. Spectators and members of the press fill the courtroom. The subject of the trial quickly shifts away from the murder to a general discussion of Meursault’s character, and of his reaction to his mother’s death in particular. The director and several other people who attended the vigil and the funeral are called to testify, and they all attest to Meursault’s lack of grief or tears. Marie reluctantly testifies that the day after his mother’s funeral she and Meursault went on a date and saw a comedic movie. During his summation the following day, the prosecutor calls Meursault a monster and says that his lack of moral feeling threatens all of society. Meursault is found guilty and is sentenced to death by beheading.
Meursault returns to prison to await his execution. He struggles to come to terms with his situation, and he has trouble accepting the certainty and inevitability of his fate. He imagines escaping and he dreams of filing a successful legal appeal. One day, the chaplain comes to visit against Meursault’s wishes. He urges Meursault to renounce his atheism and turn to God, but Meursault refuses. Like the magistrate, the chaplain cannot believe that Meursault does not long for faith and the afterlife. Meursault suddenly becomes enraged, grabs the chaplain, and begins shouting at him. He declares that he is correct in believing in a meaningless, purely physical world. For the first time, Meursault truly embraces the idea that human existence holds no greater meaning. He abandons all hope for the future and accepts the “gentle indifference of the world.” This acceptance makes Meursault feel happy."
Walk,"A Long Walk to Water weaves together the stories of two young people, both of whom are from southern Sudan. 
We first meet eleven-year old Nya. It is 2008, and she spends her days fetching water for her family. Every day, Nya travels back and forth from her village to the pond, not once but twice. 
Next, we meet Salva, also eleven years old, but the year is 1985. He sits in the schoolhouse, not far from his family’s village. At the sound of gunshots, Salva flees into the bush. War between the government and the rebels has reached his village. He walks for hours with others who are fleeing and joins a group from his village, Loun-Ariik, but his family is not among them. Soldiers lead them to the rebel camp. Salva, forced to join the group of women and children, spends the night in a barn. When he wakes up, the others have gone and he is alone. A woman from Salva’s tribe, the Dinka, befriends him. Four days later, she prepares to leave and will not take Salva with her. Strangers approach who are Dinka, but Salva’s family is not among them.
As we alternate back and forth between stories, we learn that Nya’s family must move to a camp near a lake for the dry season. It is a three-day journey from her village. Their tribe, the Nuer, fight with the rival Dinka tribe over the land near the lake, so it is too dangerous to live near the lake year-round. Every day for five months, Nya digs for water in the lake. Her father and Dep, her brother, hunt, hoping not to encounter men from the Dinka tribe. When Nya’s sister, Akeer, becomes sick, Nya and her mother travel with her to the nearest medical clinic, a several day’s walk away. Akeer receives medicine and recovers, but her sickness, the nurse tells them, came from the water, and now Nya’s family must boil their water to destroy the germs. 
When we return to Salva, he has been walking for weeks. He meets Buksa, from the Jur-chol tribe, who leads the group to a beehive. With his energy renewed from honey and beeswax, Salva continues walking, and meets Marial, a Dinka who also has not found his family. One day, Salva hears someone calling his name. It is his Uncle Jewiir. Uncle promises to take care of Salva. He has a gun and can protect Salva as they travel through the land of the Aruot, “people of the lion.” Soon afterward, Marial disappears in the middle of the night, the victim of a lion attack. Salva, crippled with grief at the loss of his friend and by his thorn-torn feet, staggers on, coaxed by his uncle to take “a step at a time.” The group crosses the Nile River and begin the treacherous journey across the Akobo desert. After several days, armed men from the Nuer tribe confront the group, and kill Uncle. Though Salva mourns the loss of Marial and Uncle, he feels their strength. He reaches a refugee camp in Ethiopia and searches for his family.
When we pick up the thread of Nya’s story, the rainy season has come and Nya’s family has returned to their village. One day, two men visit and speak with Nya’s uncle, the chief of the village. The strangers survey an area between two large trees and decide that this is where they will find water. After the two men leave, villagers begin clearing the land. Men and trucks have arrived at the village with a large drill, plastic pipes, and other equipment. Nya continues her walk to and from the pond. 
Salva’s story continues. In 1991, he is almost seventeen, and still in the refugee camp. However, war has come to Ethiopia and the soldiers force the refugees into the crocodile-infested Gilo River. Salva survives the crossing and finds himself the leader of over a thousand boys traveling to Kenya. The journey will take a year and a half. 
Fast forward to 2009 where drilling continues in Nya’s village. Workers need water to operate the drill, so they bring water in trucks from the pond to the site. When discouraged, their leader encourages them. On the third day of drilling, Nya hears a loud whoosh sound. Water shoots out of the hole. People cheer. The water that gushes forth is muddy, but soon becomes clear. Nya continues to walk to the pond while the men finish the well. Meanwhile, men from the village begin clearing the land near the second tree, preparing the land to build a school. Soon, Nya will spend her days at school rather than fetching water.
When we rejoin Salva, he is twenty-two years old, and living in the Ifo refugee camp in Kenya. Michael, an aid worker, teaches him English. Michael tells him that 3,000 men will be chosen to go to the United States. Weeks later, Salva’s name is among the list of the men chosen.
The year is 1996. On the journey to America, Salva learns that he is a Lost Boy, one of the many who have lost their families and homes in the war. Six years later, Salva is living with his adopted family in Rochester, New York, going to college, and studying business. He learns that his father is alive, recovering from surgery in a United Nations clinic in Sudan. Salva journeys to Sudan and after nineteen years apart, reunites with his father. He learns that his mother and sisters, Akit and Agnath, are alive. Two of his brothers, Ariik and Kuol are dead, but Ring is alive. Salva returns to the United States with a plan. Three years later, his goal is near. 
Back at Nya’s village, the well is finished. Villagers gather around as the crew’s leader holds up a sign. It says Elm Street School, the school in the United States whose students have raised the money for the well. Nya lines up to fill her bottle as her uncle works the pump. She drinks the clean, cool water. The leader watches the villagers from a distance. He is Dinka, Dep tells her. Why, she wonders, has he drilled water for the Nuer? She approaches him and thanks him for bringing the water. She tells him her name. Then, he introduces himself. His name is Salva."
Philanthropist,"Bigger Thomas, a poor, uneducated, twenty-year-old Black man in 1930s Chicago, wakes up one morning in his family’s cramped apartment on the South Side of the city. He sees a huge rat scamper across the room, which he corners and kills with a skillet. Having grown up under the climate of harsh racial prejudice in 1930s America, Bigger is burdened with a powerful conviction that he has no control over his life and that he cannot aspire to anything other than menial, low-wage labor. His mother pesters him to take a job with a rich white man named Mr. Dalton, but Bigger instead chooses to meet up with his friends to plan the robbery of a white man’s store.
Anger, fear, and frustration define Bigger’s daily existence, as he is forced to hide behind a façade of toughness or risk succumbing to despair. While Bigger and his gang have robbed many Black-owned businesses, they have never attempted to rob a white man. Bigger sees whites not as individuals, but as a natural, oppressive force—a great looming “whiteness” pressing down upon him. Bigger’s fear of confronting this force overwhelms him, but rather than admit his fear, he violently attacks a member of his gang to sabotage the robbery. Left with no other options, Bigger takes a job as a chauffeur for the Daltons.
Coincidentally, Mr. Dalton is also Bigger’s landlord, as he owns a controlling share of the company that manages the apartment building where Bigger’s family lives. Mr. Dalton and other wealthy real estate barons are effectively robbing the poor, Black tenants on Chicago’s South Side—they refuse to allow Black people to rent apartments in predominantly white neighborhoods, thus leading to overpopulation and artificially high rents in the predominantly Black South Side. Mr. Dalton sees himself as a benevolent philanthropist, however, as he donates money to Black schools and offers jobs to “poor, timid black boys” like Bigger. However, Mr. Dalton practices this token philanthropy mainly to alleviate his guilty conscience for exploiting poor Black people.
Mary, Mr. Dalton’s daughter, frightens and angers Bigger by ignoring the social taboos that govern the relations between white women and Black men. On his first day of work, Bigger drives Mary to meet her communist boyfriend, Jan. Eager to prove their progressive ideals and racial tolerance, Mary and Jan force Bigger to take them to a restaurant in the South Side. Despite Bigger’s embarrassment, they order drinks, and as the evening passes, all three of them get drunk. Bigger then drives around the city while Mary and Jan make out in the back seat. Afterward, Mary is too drunk to make it to her bedroom on her own, so Bigger helps her up the stairs. Drunk and aroused by his unprecedented proximity to a young white woman, Bigger begins to kiss Mary.
Just as Bigger places Mary on her bed, Mary’s blind mother, Mrs. Dalton, enters the bedroom. Though Mrs. Dalton cannot see him, her ghostlike presence terrifies him. Bigger worries that Mary, in her drunken condition, will reveal his presence. He covers her face with a pillow and accidentally smothers her to death. Unaware that Mary has been killed, Mrs. Dalton prays over her daughter and returns to bed. Bigger tries to conceal his crime by burning Mary’s body in the Daltons’ furnace. He decides to try to use the Daltons’ prejudice against communists to frame Jan for Mary’s disappearance. Bigger believes that the Daltons will assume Jan is dangerous and that he may have kidnapped their daughter for political purposes. Additionally, Bigger takes advantage of the Daltons’ racial prejudices to avoid suspicion, continuing to play the role of a timid, ignorant Black servant who would be unable to commit such an act.
Mary’s murder gives Bigger a sense of power and identity he has never known. Bigger’s girlfriend, Bessie, makes an offhand comment that inspires him to try to collect ransom money from the Daltons. They know only that Mary has vanished, not that she is dead. Bigger writes a ransom letter, playing upon the Daltons’ hatred of communists by signing his name “Red.” He then bullies Bessie to take part in the ransom scheme. However, Mary’s bones are found in the furnace, and Bigger flees with Bessie to an empty building. Bigger rapes Bessie and, frightened that she will give him away, bludgeons her to death with a brick after she falls asleep.
Bigger eludes the massive manhunt for as long as he can, but he is eventually captured after a dramatic shoot-out. The press and the public determine his guilt and his punishment before his trial even begins. The furious populace assumes that he raped Mary before killing her and burned her body to hide the evidence of the rape. Moreover, the white authorities and the white mob use Bigger’s crime as an excuse to terrorize the entire South Side .
Jan visits Bigger in jail. He says that he understands how he terrified, angered, and shamed Bigger through his violation of the social taboos that govern tense race relations. Jan enlists his friend, Boris A. Max, to defend Bigger free of charge. Jan and Max speak with Bigger as a human being, and Bigger begins to see whites as individuals and himself as their equal.
Max tries to save Bigger from the death penalty, arguing that while his client is responsible for his crime, it is vital to recognize that he is a product of his environment. Part of the blame for Bigger’s crimes belongs to the fearful, hopeless existence that he has experienced in a racist society since birth. Max warns that there will be more men like Bigger if America does not put an end to the vicious cycle of hatred and vengeance. Despite Max’s arguments, Bigger is sentenced to death.
Bigger is not a traditional hero by any means. However, Wright forces us to enter into Bigger’s mind and to understand the devastating effects of the social conditions in which he was raised. Bigger was not born a violent criminal. He is a “native son”: a product of American culture and the violence and racism that suffuse it."
Dispensed,"In Common Sense, Thomas Paine argues for American independence. His argument begins with more general, theoretical reflections about government and religion, then progresses onto the specifics of the colonial situation.
Paine begins by distinguishing between government and society. Society, according to Paine, is everything constructive and good that people join together to accomplish. Government, on the other hand, is an institution whose sole purpose is to protect us from our own vices. Government has its origins in the evil of man and is therefore a necessary evil at best. Paine says that government's sole purpose is to protect life, liberty and property, and that a government should be judged solely on the basis of the extent to which it accomplishes this goal.
Paine then considers an imagined scenario in which a small group of people has been placed on an island, and cut off from the rest of society. In time, these people develop ties with one another, and lawmaking becomes inevitable. Paine says the people will be much happier if they are responsible for the creation of the laws that rule them. Paine is also implicitly arguing that such a system of representation is also better for the American colonists. Having expressed his disagreement with British reign in America, Paine proceeds to launch a general attack on the British system of government. Paine says the British system is too complex and rife with contradictions, and that the monarchy is granted far too much power. The British system pretends to offer a reasonable system of checks and balances, but in fact, it does not.
From here Paine moves on to discuss, in general, the notions of monarchy and hereditary succession. Man, Pain argues, was born into a state of equality, and the distinction that has arisen between king and subject is an unnatural one. At first, Paine says, the world was without kings, but the ancient Jews decided they wanted a king. This angered God, but he allowed them to have one. Paine presents pages of biblical evidence detailing God's wrath at the idea of the Jews having a king. The conclusion Paine reaches is that the practice of monarchy originates from sin, and is an institution that the Bible and God condemn. Paine calls hereditary succession an abominable practice. He says that even if people were to choose to have a king, that does not legitimize that King's child acting as a future ruler. Furthermore, hereditary succession has brought with it innumerable evils, such as incompetent kings, corruption, and civil war.
Having dispensed with the preliminary theoretical issues, Paine sets in to discuss the details of the American situation. In response to the argument that America has flourished under British rule, and therefore ought to stay under the king, Paine says that such an argument fails to realize that America has evolved and no longer needs Britain's help. Some say that Britain has protected America, and therefore deserves allegiance, but Paine responds that Britain has only watched over America in order to secure its own economic well-being. Paine adds that most recently, instead of watching over the colonies, the British have been attacking them, and are therefore undeserving of American loyalty.
Paine says that the colonies have little to gain from remaining attached to Britain. Commerce can be better conducted with the rest of Europe, but only after America becomes independent. Paine also asserts that if the colonies remain attached to Britain, the same problems that have arisen in the past will arise in the future. Paine argues that it is necessary to seek independence now, as to do otherwise would only briefly cover up problems that will surely reemerge.
Paine even proposes the form of government that the independent colonies should adopt. His recommendation is for a representative democracy that gives roughly equal weight to each of the colonies.
Paine explains why the current time is a good time to break free of Britain. Primarily, Paine focuses on the present size of the colonies, and on their current capabilities. He presents an inventory of the British Navy and gives calculations revealing how America could build a navy of comparable size. Paine recommends this as a way of ensuring America's security and prosperity in trade. Paine also argues that America is sufficiently small as to be united now. If time were to elapse, and the population of the colonies to grow, the same feeling of unity would not be present. Paine adds that if the Americans revolt now, they can use the vast expanses of uncharted land to the West in order to pay down some of the debt they will incur.
Paine says that as a colony of Britain, America lacks respectability on the international scene. They are seen simply as rebels, and cannot form substantial alliances with other nations. In order to prosper in the long term, the colonies need to be independent. Paine says that, by declaring independence, America will be able to ask for the help of other countries in its struggle for freedom. For all of these reasons, Paine says it is imperative and urgent that the colonies declare independence."
Chairs,"Our Town is introduced and narrated by the Stage Manager, who welcomes the audience to the fictional town of Grover’s Corners, New Hampshire, early on a May morning in 1901. In the opening scene, the stage is largely empty, except for some tables and chairs that represent the homes of the Gibbs and Webb families, the setting of most of the action in Act I. The set remains sparse throughout the rest of the play.
	After the Stage Manager’s introduction, the activities of a typical day begin. Howie Newsome, the milkman, and Joe Crowell, Jr., the paperboy, make their delivery rounds. Dr. Gibbs returns from delivering a set of twins at one of the homes in town. Mrs. Gibbs and Mrs. Webb make breakfast, send their children off to school, and meet in their gardens to gossip. The two women also discuss their modest ambitions, and Mrs. Gibbs reveals that she longs to visit Paris.
Throughout the play, the characters pantomime their activities and chores. When Howie makes his milk deliveries, for example, no horse appears onstage despite the fact that he frequently addresses his horse as “Bessie.” Howie does not actually hold anything in his hands, but he pantomimes carrying bottles of milk, and the sound of clinking milk bottles comes from offstage. This deliberate abandonment of props goes hand in hand with the minimal set.
	The Stage Manager interrupts the action. He calls Professor Willard and then Mr. Webb out onto the stage to tell the audience some basic facts about Grover’s Corners. Mr. Webb not only reports to the audience, but also takes questions from some “audience members” who are actually characters in the play seated in the audience.
Afternoon arrives, school lets out, and George Gibbs meets his neighbor Emily Webb outside the gate of her house. We see the first inkling of George and Emily’s romantic affection for one another during this scene and during Emily’s subsequent conversation with her mother. The Stage Manager thanks and dismisses Emily and Mrs. Webb, then launches into a discussion of a time capsule that will be placed in the foundation of a new bank building in town. He tells us that he wishes to put a copy of Our Town into this time capsule.
	Now evening, a choir in the orchestra pit begins to sing “Blessed Be the Tie That Binds.” The choir, directed by the bitter yet comical choirmaster Simon Stimson, continues to sing as George and Emily talk to each other through their open windows. Mrs. Webb, Mrs. Gibbs, and their gossipy friend Mrs. Soames return home from choir practice and chat about the choirmaster’s alcoholism. The women return to their respective homes. George and his sister Rebecca sit at a window and look outside. Rebecca ponders the position of Grover’s Corners within the vastness of the universe, which she believes is contained within “the Mind of God.” Night has fallen on Grover’s Corners, and the first act comes to an end.
	Act II takes place three years later, on George and Emily’s wedding day. George tries to visit his fiancée, but he is shooed away by Mr. and Mrs. Webb, who insist that it is bad luck for the groom to see the bride-to-be on the wedding day anytime before the ceremony. Mrs. Webb goes upstairs to make sure Emily does not come downstairs. George is left alone with Mr. Webb. The young man and his future father-in-law awkwardly discuss marriage and how to be a virtuous husband.
	The Stage Manager interjects and introduces a flashback to the previous year. George and Emily are on their way home from school. George has just been elected class president and Emily has just been elected secretary and treasurer. George has also become something of a local baseball star. Emily tells George that his popularity has made him “conceited and stuck-up.” George, though hurt, thanks Emily for her honesty, but Emily becomes mortified by her own words and asks George to forget them. The two stop at Mr. Morgan’s drugstore for ice-cream sodas and, over the course of their drink, admit their mutual affection. George decides to scrap his plan of attending agriculture school in favor of staying in Grover’s Corners with Emily.
	We return to the day of the wedding in 1904. Both the bride and groom feel jittery, but their parents calm them down and the ceremony goes ahead as planned. The Stage Manager acts as the clergyman. The newlyweds run out through the audience, and the second act ends with the Stage Manager’s announcement that it is time for another intermission.
	Act III takes place nine years later, in a cemetery on a hilltop overlooking the town. Emily has died in childbirth and is about to be buried. The funeral party occupies the back of the stage. The most prominent characters in this act, the dead souls who already inhabit the cemetery, sit in chairs at the front of the stage. Among the dead are Mrs. Gibbs, Mrs. Soames, Wally Webb, and Simon Stimson. As the funeral takes place, the dead speak, serving as detached witnesses. Death has rendered them largely indifferent to earthly events. Emily joins the dead, but she misses her previous life and decides to go back and relive part of it. The other souls disapprove and advise Emily to stay in the cemetery.
	With the aid of the Stage Manager, Emily steps into the past, revisiting the morning of her twelfth birthday. Howie Newsome and Joe Crowell, Jr. make their deliveries as usual. Mrs. Webb gives her daughter some presents and calls to Mr. Webb. As Emily participates, she also watches the scene as an observer, noting her parents’ youth and beauty. Emily now has a nostalgic appreciation for everyday life that her parents and the other living characters do not share. She becomes agonized by the beauty and transience of everyday life and demands to be taken back to the cemetery. As Emily settles in among the dead souls, George lays prostrate by her tomb. “They don’t understand,” she says of the living. The stars come out over Grover’s Corners, and the play ends."
Example,"In Outliers: The Story of Success, Malcolm Gladwell considers the circumstances that lead to success. The first half of the book looks closely at how opportunities matter more in the lives of successful people than hard work or raw talent. The second half of the book focuses on cultural legacies: behavioral tendencies rooted in their ancestral past.
Part One examines the role of opportunity in the lives of extremely successful people. Gladwell’s first example is the Canadian Hockey League, the world’s most competitive youth hockey league. Since the cutoff date for the Canadian leagues that serve the youngest players is January 1, those born in the first part of the calendar year are much larger and more coordinated than their peers. The larger and more coordinated kids are given more playing time and better coaching, and thus become better players by the time they reach the top league. An overwhelming majority of Canadian professional hockey players have birthdays in January, February or March.
Gladwell proposes that 10,000 hours of practice is needed to master a skill, even for prodigies like Mozart. Bill Joy, Bill Gates, and the Beatles all worked hard to achieve success but benefited from opportunities they did not create. Joy, one of the founders of Sun Microsystems, happened to attend one of the first colleges in the world with a time-sharing terminal. In graduate school, he had a terminal in his room, where he spent all of his free time programming. Gates happened to attend a private high school with a time-sharing terminal connected to a mainframe in Seattle. He also was able to spend all of his free time programming. Early on, the Beatles were hired to play long shows day after day in Hamburg, Germany. 
Birth year or era is another form of opportunity. Gates and Joy (as well as other early programmers) all reached the end of their teen years just as personal computers became available to the public. In another example, fourteen of the top seventy-five richest people in the history of the world happened to be alive at the same time, in the same country: the United States in the mid-1800s.
Opportunity matters more than an individual’s IQ. Using a study conducted by Lewis Terman, the creator of the Stanford-Binet IQ test, Gladwell shows that “practical intelligence” is as important as “analytical intelligence.” He also contrasts Chris Langan, one of the world’s smartest living people, with Robert Oppenheimer. While both had difficulties in college, only Oppenheimer had a successful life, due to his practical intelligence.
The last portion of Part One looks at Joe Flom, a successful lawyer from New York City. While he was born into a poor family to Jewish immigrants (in a time when Jewish immigrants were not treated well), many of the disadvantages in his life were actually benefits and directly contributed to his success.
Part Two investigates cultural legacies. Using flight recorder transcripts from several plane crashes from the last few decades, Gladwell shows that cultural expectations and habits can be a severe hindrance to pilots. Copilots from countries that have a high “Power Distance Index” (those that show the most deference to authority) will often avoid telling pilots that they are making mistakes, even when the mistakes are potentially fatal. After recognizing the dangers of such cultural expectations, commercial aviation has instituted programs to change the way flight crews talk with one another. 
Gladwell next analyzes the disparity in public school math test scores between Eastern and Western countries. He suggests that the cultures in which rice paddy farming is historically important have a stronger work ethic. Using various examples, Gladwell shows that hard work has a greater impact on success in learning mathematics than intelligence. 
The final example is an examination of the KIPP school in the South Bronx and the “achievement gap” between socioeconomic groups. American students from middle-class and affluent households retain more information over summer vacation and are more likely to make additional gains than students from low-income households. The KIPP school uses longer school days and summer programming to eliminate the achievement gap for low-income children. While the work schedule is very rigorous, the school’s students go on to great academic success.
Gladwell demonstrates that if more opportunities were available, there would be far more successful people and the world would be richer for it."
Administer,"Starr Carter, a sixteen-year-old black girl, attends a party in her neighborhood, Garden Heights. Starr goes with Kenya, a friend with whom she shares an older half-brother, Seven. Ever since attending Williamson Prep, a primarily white school, Starr feels out of place in the Garden Heights social scene. When Kenya goes off with other friends, Starr runs into her childhood best friend, Khalil Harris, whom she hasn’t seen in a long time. Gunshots from a gang fight interrupt the party, and Khalil offers to take Starr home. While Khalil drives, he explains rapper Tupac Shakur’s idea that “Thug Life” stands for “The Hate U Give Little Infants F---- Everybody.” Soon after, a white police officer with the badge number one-fifteen pulls them over. Khalil questions the motivation for the stop, and One-Fifteen orders him out of the car and searches him. One-Fifteen commands Khalil not to move, and returns to his car. Khalil opens the door to check on Starr. One-Fifteen fatally shoots Khalil.
Starr has nightmares about the death of another childhood friend, Natasha, who died in the crossfire of a gang shooting. At school on Monday, Starr feels tense around Hailey and Chris, her white friend and boyfriend, as memories of Khalil’s death interrupt her thoughts and she realizes they don’t understand. At the urging of her uncle Carlos, a police officer, Starr goes into the police station after school with her mother, Lisa, to testify about Khalil’s shooting. Starr realizes that the officers are asking more questions about whether Khalil was a troublemaker than about the night of the shooting. She worries that justice for Khalil will not be served. At Khalil’s funeral, a lawyer and activist named April Ofrah confirms Starr’s fears when she announces that the police will not pursue legal action against One-Fifteen and invites the attendees to a rally in Khalil’s honor. Starr blames herself for the police’s inaction. King, the head of a local gang called the King Lords, also interrupts the funeral and places a gray bandana on Khalil’s casket, signifying Khalil’s membership in the King Lords. April Ofrah tells Starr to call her if she needs legal representation.
The news that the police won’t prosecute One-Fifteen leads to days of protests in Garden Heights. During this time, Maverick, Starr’s father, explains to her his interpretation of Tupac’s phrase “Thug Life.” He believes that Thug Life describes a system designed against black communities. Only by speaking out can black communities begin to break the cycle. At the Carter family’s grocery store, a teenage member of the King Lords named DeVante begs Maverick, a former King Lord, to help him leave the gang. Maverick agrees. Starr sees DeVante’s request as a chance to help someone in a similar situation as Khalil. A few days later, Maverick gets into an argument with the neighborhood barber, Mr. Lewis. Although the argument is peaceful, two police officers intervene, and when they see Maverick is Starr’s father, they push him to the ground and search him. Between this scary event and pressure from Kenya, Starr decides that she will no longer be silent.
The District Attorney calls Lisa to announce that a grand jury will hear the case against One-Fifteen and asks if Starr will testify. Starr agrees, and April Ofrah decides to represent Starr pro bono, and also find a way to get Starr a television interview. Meanwhile, DeVante tells Starr that Khalil had never been a member of the King Lords and only sold drugs for King to protect his mother, who had stolen money from King. During Starr’s television interview, she decides, against Ms. Ofrah’s advice, to talk about the truth behind Khalil’s drug dealing. Starr’s implication of King enrages him. The night before her grand jury testimony, someone throws a brick and fires a gun into the Carter household. Unsure if the culprits are the King Lords or the police, Starr almost backs out of testifying. However, she ultimately decides that Khalil needs her truth. She testifies before the grand jury.
Almost two months later, the grand jury announces their decision not to indict One-Fifteen. Starr and some of her friends get caught up in the resulting riots. As she tries to avoid the chaos, Starr stumbles upon a protest led by Ms. Ofrah. She offers Starr the megaphone, and Starr leads a chant in front of the protest. The police try to break up the protest with tear gas. Starr and her friends head to the Carter family store to get milk to help heal their eyes. A Molotov cocktail lands in the store, setting it ablaze and trapping them. Maverick arrives just in time to unlock the back door. King arrives to taunt them, proud about getting his revenge. The police arrive, and King, confident that no one will testify against him, claims ignorance. However, the neighbors rally around the Carter family and tell the police that they saw King throw the Molotov cocktail. The police arrest King. Although the grocery store is in ruins, Starr knows that the family will rebuild. She vows to continue fighting for justice on behalf of Khalil and all other black people killed at the hands of police."
From,"Finding himself laid up in the small New England town of Starkfield for the winter, the narrator sets out to learn about the life of a mysterious local named Ethan Frome, who had a tragic accident some twenty years earlier. After questioning various locals with little result, the narrator finally comes to learn the details of Ethan’s “smash-up” (as the locals call it) when a violent snowstorm forces the narrator into an overnight stay at the Frome household.
Going back to that tragic year, we find Ethan walking through snowy Starkfield at midnight. He arrives at the village church, where lights in the basement reveal a dance. Ethan loiters by the window, transfixed by the sight of a young girl in a cherry-colored scarf. He has come to the church to fetch his wife’s cousin, Mattie Silver, who has been living with the Fromes for over a year, helping around the house. Eventually, we learn that Mattie is the girl in the red scarf—and the object of Ethan’s affection.
When the dance lets out, Ethan hangs back to keep his presence unknown. Mattie refuses the offer of a ride from another young man named Denis Eady and begins the walk home alone. Ethan catches up with her. As they continue on their way together, Ethan experiences a sense of thrill in Mattie’s presence, and the tension between the two becomes apparent. However, the tension dissipates when they arrive home and Zeena, Ethan’s sickly, shrewish wife, who has kept a late-night vigil in anticipation of their return, greets them. She regards the dynamic between her husband and her cousin with obvious suspicion, and Ethan goes to bed in a state of unease, without a word to Zeena and with thoughts only of Mattie.
The next day Ethan spends the morning cutting wood and returns home to find his wife prepared for a journey. She has decided to seek treatment for her illness in a neighboring town, where she will spend the night with some distant relatives. Excited by the prospect of an evening alone with Mattie, Ethan quickly assents to his wife’s plan. He goes into town to make a lumber sale, but he hurries so as to return to Mattie in time for supper.
That evening, tensions run high between Ethan and Mattie. Although the two never consummate or even verbalize their passions, their mutual feelings hang palpably between them, unspoiled by the house’s many reminders of the absent Zeena. Catastrophe threatens when the cat shatters Zeena’s favorite pickle dish, which Mattie had taken out to celebrate their dinner together, but Ethan quickly pieces the shards together and tucks the broken dish back in its place. After supper, with Mattie busy at her sewing work, Ethan contemplates an outright demonstration of his affections, but he stops short of full disclosure. Just after eleven, the two turn in for the night without so much as touching.
The next morning, Ethan remains eager to reveal his feelings to Mattie, but the presence of his hired man, Jotham Powell, coupled with his own inhibitions, prevent him from making a move. Ethan makes a run into town to pick up some glue for the pickle dish. When he arrives back at the farm, expecting to find Mattie alone, she informs him that Zeena has returned. Quickly collecting himself, Ethan visits the bedroom to greet his wife. Zeena, however, is in no mood for kindnesses and bitterly informs Ethan that her health is failing rapidly. In light of this fact, Zeena announces, she plans to replace Mattie with a more efficient hired girl. Ethan privately resents Zeena’s decision but keeps the bulk of his anger to himself.
Going down to the kitchen, Ethan’s passions spill over, and he kisses Mattie zealously. He tells Mattie of Zeena’s plan to dismiss her, but their moment together is interrupted by Zeena herself, who had originally declined to come down to dinner but has changed her mind. After the meal, Zeena discovers the broken pickle dish while in search of some medicines and, in her rage, grows all the more determined to chase Mattie out.
That evening, Ethan retreats to his makeshift study, where he contemplates the decision that lies before him. Unable to tolerate Mattie’s dismissal, but effectively unable to prevent it, Ethan briefly considers eloping with Mattie, and even begins to draft a letter of farewell to Zeena. However, in a sober evaluation of his financial situation, Ethan comes to realize the impossibility of running away and falls asleep in a state of hopelessness.
At breakfast the next morning, Zeena announces the day’s plans for Mattie’s departure and the arrival of the new hired girl. At mid-morning, having finished his tasks on the farm, Ethan steals into town on a desperate errand. His plan, hatched on the fly, is to make a second attempt to collect an advance from Andrew Hale on a recently delivered lumber load, in hopes of financing his elopement with Mattie after all. On his way down the hill Ethan encounters the Hale sleigh, and, in passing, Hale’s wife praises him greatly for his patience in caring for the ailing Zeena. Her kind words serve to check his plan, and he returns to the farm with a guilty conscience.
Against Zeena’s wishes, Ethan decides to bring Mattie to the station himself. In a fit of nostalgia, he takes her by a roundabout route, and they eventually end up stopping at the crest of a village hill in order to take a sledding adventure they had once proposed but had never undertaken. A successful first run prompts Mattie to suggest a second, but with a different purpose in mind. She asks Ethan to run the sled into the elm tree at the foot of the hill, allowing them to spend their last moments together. Ethan initially rejects her proposal but is slowly won over, and they take their positions on the sled, locking themselves in a final embrace. In the wake of the collision, Ethan comes to consciousness dazedly, reaching out to feel the face of the softly moaning Mattie, who opens her eyes and weakly utters his name.
Jumping forward twenty years, we find ourselves back in the company of the narrator as he enters the Frome household. Inside, he meets the gaze of two frail and aging women, and takes stock of the house’s squalid conditions. Frome apologizes for the lack of heat in the house and introduces the narrator to the woman preparing their supper—his wife, Zeena—and to the seated, paralyzed woman in the chair by the fire—Miss Mattie Silver.
The next day, the narrator returns to town, where he lodges with Mrs. Ned Hale and her mother, Mrs. Varnum. Sensing their curiosity, he gives a brief account of his evening in the Frome household, and after supper he settles down to a more intimate discussion with Mrs. Hale. Together, they mourn the tragic plight of the silent, cursed man and the two women fated to keep him company during the long New England winter nights."
Approving,"Anne’s diary begins on her thirteenth birthday, June 12, 1942, and ends shortly after her fifteenth. At the start of her diary, Anne describes fairly typical girlhood experiences, writing about her friendships with other girls, her crushes on boys, and her academic performance at school. Because anti-Semitic laws forced Jews into separate schools, Anne and her older sister, Margot, attended the Jewish Lyceum in Amsterdam.
	The Franks had moved to the Netherlands in the years leading up to World War II to escape persecution in Germany. After the Germans invaded the Netherlands in 1940, the Franks were forced into hiding. With another family, the van Daans, and an acquaintance, Mr. Dussel, they moved into a small secret annex above Otto Frank’s office where they had stockpiled food and supplies. The employees from Otto’s firm helped hide the Franks and kept them supplied with food, medicine, and information about the outside world.
	The residents of the annex pay close attention to every development of the war by listening to the radio. Some bits of news catch Anne’s attention and make their way into her diary, providing a vivid historical context for her personal thoughts. The adults make optimistic bets about when the war will end, and their mood is severely affected by Allied setbacks or German advances. Amsterdam is devastated by the war during the two years the Franks are in hiding. All of the city’s residents suffer, since food becomes scarce and robberies more frequent.
	Anne often writes about her feelings of isolation and loneliness. She has a tumultuous relationship with the adults in the annex, particularly her mother, whom she considers lacking in love and affection. She adores her father, but she is frequently scolded and criticized by Mr. and Mrs. van Daan and Mr. Dussel. Anne thinks that her sister, Margot, is smart, pretty, and agreeable, but she does not feel close to her and does not write much about her. Anne eventually develops a close friendship with Peter van Daan, the teenage boy in the annex. Mr. Frank does not approve, however, and the intensity of Anne’s infatuation begins to lessen.
	Anne matures considerably throughout the course of her diary entries, moving from detailed accounts of basic activities to deeper, more profound thoughts about humanity and her own personal nature. She finds it difficult to understand why the Jews are being singled out and persecuted. Anne also confronts her own identity. Though she considers herself to be German, her German citizenship has been revoked, and though she calls Holland her home, many of the Dutch have turned against the Jews. Anne feels a tremendous solidarity with her aggrieved people, and yet at the same time she wants to be seen as an individual rather than a member of a persecuted group.
During the two years recorded in her diary, Anne deals with confinement and deprivation, as well as the complicated and difficult issues of growing up in the brutal circumstances of the Holocaust. Her diary describes a struggle to define herself within this climate of oppression. Anne’s diary ends without comment on August 1, 1944, the end of a seemingly normal day that leaves us with the expectation of seeing another entry on the next page. However, the Frank family is betrayed to the Nazis and arrested on August 4, 1944. Anne’s diary, the observations of an imaginative, friendly, sometimes petty, and rather normal teenage girl, comes to an abrupt and silent end. 
Otto Frank is the family’s sole survivor, and he recovers Anne’s diary from Miep. He decides to fulfill Anne’s wishes by publishing the diary. Anne’s diary becomes a condemnation of the unimaginable horror of the Holocaust, and one of the few accounts that describe it from a young person’s perspective.
	Since Anne’s diary is a true personal account of a life in hiding, it is inappropriate to analyze it as a novel or other work of fiction. Parts of the diary were intended for public view, but others clearly were not. To appreciate and interpret the diary, it is necessary to consider its horrible context, World War II and the Holocaust, before any discussion of plot development or thematic content."
Instructions,"Some two and a half centuries after its creation, the city of Ember is in a state of crisis. Chronic supply shortages and blackouts ravish the city, which is devoid of any natural light, while a deadly coughing disease plagues its populace. Ember’s surviving citizens, largely impoverished and often consumed by total darkness, live in fear and sense impending doom.
The story begins in the distant past, shortly after Ember’s “Builders” have completed construction of the city. Its chief builder, during a discussion with his assistant, reveals that its inhabitants must live there for at least 200 years and that the Builders will provide a list of critical instructions intended for Ember’s future citizens. The instructions will be sealed in a box with a timed lock programmed to open at the right date. Only the city’s mayors, in succession, are to know about the box, though none of them will know what is contained within. At this point, the Builders’ identity and their purpose for creating the city remain a mystery.
With Ember’s origin story, however vaguely, now established, the story fast-forwards to the present. It is year 241, though by now citizens have lost an accurate count of how many years have passed since the city’s inception. Twelve-year-old Lina Mayfleet, who has recently graduated from school and joined the adult workforce as a Messenger, finds the secret box in her apartment after her Granny dislodges it from the far depths of a closet. The box, now open, has remained there for generations after Lina’s great-great-grandfather and Ember’s seventh mayor, Podd Morethwart, absconded with the box and tried, unsuccessfully, to unlock it for his own benefit. Next to the box, Lina sees that her baby sister, Poppy, has torn and chewed its contents: a piece of paper, now in fragments strewn across the floor, lined with perfect printing that Lina believes must have come from the Builders.
Like all of Ember’s citizens, Lina has been taught that Ember stands alone, that it is a solitary city in an otherwise empty world engulfed in darkness beginning at the city’s edges and extending forever in the Unknown Regions. But she believes and has faith in a city of light, one she often dreams of and draws in pictures that decorate the walls of her apartment. She also believes that the piece of paper from the unlocked box contains a vital message that could save Ember from a tragic fate. 
Lina determines, then, to decode the paper’s message, filling in its broken and missing words. Lina enlists the help of Doon Harrow, a friend and former schoolmate who now works in the underground labyrinth of Ember’s Pipeworks and who shares her passion for saving the city. With assistance from Lina’s friend, Clary, who works in the city’s greenhouses, the two soon see that the message contains a seven-step list of instructions for exiting Ember. Its point of egress, they ultimately discover, is in the Pipeworks and its source, a raging underground river that powers the city’s failing generator. Their curiosity and determination also lead them to hidden rooms, hollowed out along the river’s edge and filled with matches, candles, and boats for all of Ember’s citizens to escape.
While Lina and Doon work to decode the message, they uncover unsettling truths about the city and some of its residents. Lina learns that her friend Lizzie Bisco has been stealing coveted storeroom goods with her boyfriend and fellow storeroom worker, Looper. While exploring an off-limits tunnel in the Pipeworks, Doon discovers a secret room where Mayor Cole hordes rare and precious supplies, including food and light bulbs. The two children take their findings to Assistant Guard Barton Snode at Ember’s Gathering Hall, but their attempts to reveal the mayor’s corruption backfire. City guards, conspiring with the mayor, set out to capture Lina and Doon and punish them for spreading what they say are vicious rumors. 
Lina and Doon had planned to reveal Ember’s exit instructions and the mayor’s lies at Singing, an annual event where citizens gather to sing the city’s three great songs. But as they hide from the guards in Ember School, they decide instead to exit the city that day after leaving a message with Clary so that their fellow citizens can do the same.
Lina and Doon escape with Poppy by boat and, after reaching the river’s end, see a sign from the Builders, welcoming refugees from Ember. They then ascend a steep passage that emerges into a vast wilderness lit with moonlight and other natural wonders they have never before seen. As Lina and Doon read a journal left near the river’s end by one of Ember’s first inhabitants, they can finally make full sense of Ember’s mystery: The Builders, a group of concerned scientists and engineers, created the city as an underground refuge for humans, believing the earth was in great peril at the time. Now, centuries later, Lina and Doon feel unsure if anyone is still alive on the surface. 
Having realized that Lina is still carrying the note for Clary, the children fear those remaining in Ember will not find the way out. As they search for a way back into Ember, they follow a steep climb leading to an indent in the earth and within a narrow tunnel that ends with an immense drop and a dramatic discovery: Visible by a cluster of electric lights, Ember exists at the bottom of the vast chasm, and the only way for Lina and Doon to make contact is with Clary’s note. Lina weighs the message down with a rock, wraps it in Doon’s shirt, and then hurls the bundle into the darkness below. Back in Ember, the message lands, directly in front of one of Lina’s neighbors."
Offered,"Offred is a Handmaid in the Republic of Gilead, a totalitarian and theocratic state that has replaced the United States of America. Because of dangerously low reproduction rates, Handmaids are assigned to bear children for elite couples that have trouble conceiving. Offred serves the Commander and his wife, Serena Joy, a former gospel singer and advocate for “traditional values.” Offred is not the narrator’s real name—Handmaid names consist of the word “of” followed by the name of the Handmaid’s Commander. Every month, when Offred is at the right point in her menstrual cycle, she must have ritualized sex with the Commander while Serena sits behind her, holding her hands. Offred’s freedom, like the freedom of all women, is completely restricted. She can leave the house only on shopping trips, the door to her room cannot be completely shut, and the Eyes, Gilead’s secret police force, watch her every public move.
As Offred tells the story of her daily life, she frequently slips into flashbacks, from which the reader can reconstruct the events leading up to the beginning of the novel. In the old world, before Gilead, Offred had an affair with Luke, a married man. Luke divorced his wife and married Offred, and they had a child together. Offred’s mother was a single mother and feminist activist. Offred’s best friend, Moira, was fiercely independent. The architects of Gilead began their rise to power in an age of readily available pornography, prostitution, and violence against women—when pollution and chemical spills led to declining fertility rates. Using the military, they assassinated the president and members of Congress and launched a coup, claiming that they were taking power temporarily. They cracked down on women’s rights, forbidding women to hold property or jobs. Offred and Luke took their daughter and attempted to flee across the border into Canada, but they were caught and separated from one another, and Offred has seen neither her husband nor her daughter since.
After her capture, Offred’s marriage was voided (because Luke had been divorced), and she was sent to the Rachel and Leah Re-education Center, called the Red Center by its inhabitants. At the center, women were indoctrinated into Gilead’s ideology in preparation for becoming Handmaids. Aunt Lydia supervised the women, giving speeches extolling Gilead’s beliefs that women should be subservient to men and solely concerned with bearing children. Aunt Lydia also argued that such a social order ultimately offers women more respect and safety than the old, pre-Gilead society offered them. Moira is brought to the Red Center, but she escapes, and Offred does not know what becomes of her.
Once Offred is assigned to the Commander’s house, her life settles into a restrictive routine. She takes shopping trips with Ofglen, another Handmaid, and they visit the Wall outside what used to be Harvard University, where the bodies of rebels hang. She must visit the doctor frequently to be checked for disease and other complications, and she must endure the “Ceremony,” in which the Commander reads to the household from the Bible, then goes to the bedroom, where Serena and Offred wait for him, and has sex with Offred.
The first break from her routine occurs when she visits the doctor and he offers to have sex with her to get her pregnant, suggesting that her Commander is probably infertile. She refuses. The doctor makes her uneasy, but his proposition is too risky—she could be sent away if caught. After a Ceremony, the Commander sends his gardener and chauffeur, Nick, to ask Offred to come see him in his study the following night. She begins visiting him regularly. They play Scrabble (which is forbidden, since women are not allowed to read), and he lets her look at old magazines like Vogue. At the end of these secret meetings, he asks her to kiss him.
During one of their shopping trips, Ofglen reveals to Offred that she is a member of “Mayday,” an underground organization dedicated to overthrowing Gilead. Meanwhile, Offred begins to find that the Ceremony feels different and less impersonal now that she knows the Commander. Their nighttime conversations begin to touch on the new order that the Commander and his fellow leaders have created in Gilead. When Offred admits how unhappy she is, the Commander remarks, “[Y]ou can’t make an omelette without breaking eggs.”
After some time has gone by without Offred becoming pregnant, Serena suggests that Offred have sex with Nick secretly and pass the child off as the Commander’s. Serena promises to bring Offred a picture of her daughter if she sleeps with Nick, and Offred realizes with horror that Serena has always known where her daughter was. The same night that Offred is to sleep with Nick, the Commander secretly takes her out to a club called Jezebel’s, where the Commanders mingle with prostitutes. Offred sees Moira working there. The two women meet in a bathroom, and Offred learns that Moira was captured just before she crossed the border. She chose life in Jezebel’s over being sent to the Colonies, where most political prisoners and others who pose a threat to Gilead are sent. After that night at Jezebel’s, Offred says, she never sees Moira again. The Commander takes Offred upstairs after a few hours, and they have sex in what used to be a hotel room. She tries to feign passion.
Soon after Offred returns from Jezebel’s, late at night, Serena arrives and tells Offred to go to Nick’s room. Offred and Nick have sex. Soon they begin to sleep together frequently, without anyone’s knowledge. Offred becomes caught up in the affair and ignores Ofglen’s requests that she gather information from the Commander for Mayday. One day, all the Handmaids take part in a group execution of a supposed rapist, supervised by Aunt Lydia. Ofglen strikes the first blow. Later, she tells Offred that the so-called rapist was a member of Mayday and that she hit him to put him out of his misery.
Shortly thereafter, Offred goes out shopping, and a new Ofglen meets her. This new woman is not part of Mayday, and she tells Offred that the old Ofglen hanged herself when she saw the secret police coming for her. At home, Serena has found out about Offred’s trip to Jezebel’s, and she sends her to her room, promising punishment. Offred waits there, and she sees a black van from the Eyes approach. Then Nick comes in and tells her that the Eyes are really Mayday members who have come to save her. Offred leaves with them, over the Commander’s futile objections, on her way either to prison or to freedom—she does not know which.
The novel closes with an epilogue from 2195, after Gilead has fallen, written in the form of a lecture given by Professor Pieixoto. He explains the formation and customs of Gilead in objective, analytical language. He discusses the significance of Offred’s story, which has been found on cassette tapes in Bangor, Maine. Pieixoto suggests that Nick arranged Offred’s escape but that her fate after that is unknown. She could have escaped to Canada or England, or she could have been recaptured."
Reference,"In Outliers: The Story of Success, Malcolm Gladwell considers the circumstances that lead to success. The first half of the book looks closely at how opportunities matter more in the lives of successful people than hard work or raw talent. The second half of the book focuses on cultural legacies: behavioral tendencies rooted in their ancestral past.
Part One examines the role of opportunity in the lives of extremely successful people. Gladwell’s first example is the Canadian Hockey League, the world’s most competitive youth hockey league. Since the cutoff date for the Canadian leagues that serve the youngest players is January 1, those born in the first part of the calendar year are much larger and more coordinated than their peers. The larger and more coordinated kids are given more playing time and better coaching, and thus become better players by the time they reach the top league. An overwhelming majority of Canadian professional hockey players have birthdays in January, February or March.
Gladwell proposes that 10,000 hours of practice is needed to master a skill, even for prodigies like Mozart. Bill Joy, Bill Gates, and the Beatles all worked hard to achieve success but benefited from opportunities they did not create. Joy, one of the founders of Sun Microsystems, happened to attend one of the first colleges in the world with a time-sharing terminal. In graduate school, he had a terminal in his room, where he spent all of his free time programming. Gates happened to attend a private high school with a time-sharing terminal connected to a mainframe in Seattle. He also was able to spend all of his free time programming. Early on, the Beatles were hired to play long shows day after day in Hamburg, Germany. 
Birth year or era is another form of opportunity. Gates and Joy (as well as other early programmers) all reached the end of their teen years just as personal computers became available to the public. In another example, fourteen of the top seventy-five richest people in the history of the world happened to be alive at the same time, in the same country: the United States in the mid-1800s.
Opportunity matters more than an individual’s IQ. Using a study conducted by Lewis Terman, the creator of the Stanford-Binet IQ test, Gladwell shows that “practical intelligence” is as important as “analytical intelligence.” He also contrasts Chris Langan, one of the world’s smartest living people, with Robert Oppenheimer. While both had difficulties in college, only Oppenheimer had a successful life, due to his practical intelligence.
The last portion of Part One looks at Joe Flom, a successful lawyer from New York City. While he was born into a poor family to Jewish immigrants (in a time when Jewish immigrants were not treated well), many of the disadvantages in his life were actually benefits and directly contributed to his success.
Part Two investigates cultural legacies. Using flight recorder transcripts from several plane crashes from the last few decades, Gladwell shows that cultural expectations and habits can be a severe hindrance to pilots. Copilots from countries that have a high “Power Distance Index” (those that show the most deference to authority) will often avoid telling pilots that they are making mistakes, even when the mistakes are potentially fatal. After recognizing the dangers of such cultural expectations, commercial aviation has instituted programs to change the way flight crews talk with one another. 
Gladwell next analyzes the disparity in public school math test scores between Eastern and Western countries. He suggests that the cultures in which rice paddy farming is historically important have a stronger work ethic. Using various examples, Gladwell shows that hard work has a greater impact on success in learning mathematics than intelligence. 
The final example is an examination of the KIPP school in the South Bronx and the “achievement gap” between socioeconomic groups. American students from middle-class and affluent households retain more information over summer vacation and are more likely to make additional gains than students from low-income households. The KIPP school uses longer school days and summer programming to eliminate the achievement gap for low-income children. While the work schedule is very rigorous, the school’s students go on to great academic success.
Gladwell demonstrates that if more opportunities were available, there would be far more successful people and the world would be richer for it."
Timeâ,"A Wrinkle in Time is the story of Meg Murry, a high-school-aged girl who is transported on an adventure through time and space with her younger brother Charles Wallace and her friend Calvin O'Keefe to rescue her father, a gifted scientist, from the evil forces that hold him prisoner on another planet. At the beginning of the book, Meg is a homely, awkward, but loving girl, troubled by personal insecurities and her concern for her father, who has been missing for over a year. The plot begins with the arrival of Mrs. Whatsit at the Murry house on a dark and stormy evening. Although she looks like an eccentric tramp, she is actually a celestial creature with the ability to read Meg's thoughts. She startles Meg's mother by reassuring her of the existence of a tesseract--a sort of ""wrinkle"" in space and time. It is through this wrinkle that Meg and her companions will travel through the fifth dimension in search of Mr. Murry.
On the afternoon following Mrs. Whatsit's visit, Meg and Charles Wallace walk over to Mrs. Whatsit's cabin. On the way, they meet Calvin O'Keefe, a popular boy in Meg's school whom Charles considers a kindred spirit. The three children learn from Mrs. Whatsit and her friends Mrs. Who and Mrs. Which that the universe is threatened by a great evil called the Dark Thing and taking the form of a giant cloud, engulfing the stars around it. Several planets have already succumbed to this evil force, including Camazotz, the planet on which Mr. Murry is imprisoned.
The three Mrs. W's transport the children to Camazotz and instruct them to remain always in each other's company while on their quest for Mr. Murry. On Camazotz, all objects and places appear exactly alike because the whole planet must conform to the terrifying rhythmic pulsation of IT, a giant disembodied brain. Charles Wallace tries to fight IT with his exceptional intelligence but is overpowered by the evil and becomes a robot-like creature mouthing the words with which IT infuses him. Under the control of IT, Charles leads Meg and Calvin to Mr. Murry and together they confront IT. However, they, too, are unable to withstand IT's power; they escape only at the last minute, when Mr. Murry appears and seizes Meg and Calvin, ""tessering"" away with them (traveling via another tesseract) to a gray planet called Ixchel inhabited by tall, furry beasts who care for the travelers. Charles Wallace remains possessed by IT, a prisoner of Camazotz.
On Planet Ixchel the three Mrs. W's appear once again, and Meg realizes that she must travel alone back to Camazotz to rescue her brother. Mrs. Which tells her that she has one thing that IT does not have, and this will be her weapon against the evil. However, Meg must discover this weapon for herself. When standing in the presence of IT, Meg realizes what this is: her ability to love. Thus, by concentrating on her love for Charles Wallace, she is able to restore him to his true identity. Meg releases Charles from IT's clutches and tessers with him through time and space, landing in her twin brothers' vegetable garden on Earth, where her father and Calvin stand waiting. The family joyously reunites, and the Mrs. W's visit the happy scene en route to further travels."
Boat,"The Old Man and the Sea is the story of an epic struggle between an old, seasoned fisherman and the greatest catch of his life. For eighty-four days, Santiago, an aged Cuban fisherman, has set out to sea and returned empty-handed. So conspicuously unlucky is he that the parents of his young, devoted apprentice and friend, Manolin, have forced the boy to leave the old man in order to fish in a more prosperous boat. Nevertheless, the boy continues to care for the old man upon his return each night. He helps the old man tote his gear to his ramshackle hut, secures food for him, and discusses the latest developments in American baseball, especially the trials of the old man’s hero, Joe DiMaggio. Santiago is confident that his unproductive streak will soon come to an end, and he resolves to sail out farther than usual the following day.
On the eighty-fifth day of his unlucky streak, Santiago does as promised, sailing his skiff far beyond the island’s shallow coastal waters and venturing into the Gulf Stream. He prepares his lines and drops them. At noon, a big fish, which he knows is a marlin, takes the bait that Santiago has placed one hundred fathoms deep in the waters. The old man expertly hooks the fish, but he cannot pull it in. Instead, the fish begins to pull the boat.
Unable to tie the line fast to the boat for fear the fish would snap a taut line, the old man bears the strain of the line with his shoulders, back, and hands, ready to give slack should the marlin make a run. The fish pulls the boat all through the day, through the night, through another day, and through another night. It swims steadily northwest until at last it tires and swims east with the current. The entire time, Santiago endures constant pain from the fishing line. Whenever the fish lunges, leaps, or makes a dash for freedom, the cord cuts Santiago badly. Although wounded and weary, the old man feels a deep empathy and admiration for the marlin, his brother in suffering, strength, and resolve.
On the third day the fish tires, and Santiago, sleep-deprived, aching, and nearly delirious, manages to pull the marlin in close enough to kill it with a harpoon thrust. Dead beside the skiff, the marlin is the largest Santiago has ever seen. He lashes it to his boat, raises the small mast, and sets sail for home. While Santiago is excited by the price that the marlin will bring at market, he is more concerned that the people who will eat the fish are unworthy of its greatness.
As Santiago sails on with the fish, the marlin’s blood leaves a trail in the water and attracts sharks. The first to attack is a great mako shark, which Santiago manages to slay with the harpoon. In the struggle, the old man loses the harpoon and lengths of valuable rope, which leaves him vulnerable to other shark attacks. The old man fights off the successive vicious predators as best he can, stabbing at them with a crude spear he makes by lashing a knife to an oar, and even clubbing them with the boat’s tiller. Although he kills several sharks, more and more appear, and by the time night falls, Santiago’s continued fight against the scavengers is useless. They devour the marlin’s precious meat, leaving only skeleton, head, and tail. Santiago chastises himself for going “out too far,” and for sacrificing his great and worthy opponent. He arrives home before daybreak, stumbles back to his shack, and sleeps very deeply.
The next morning, a crowd of amazed fishermen gathers around the skeletal carcass of the fish, which is still lashed to the boat. Knowing nothing of the old man’s struggle, tourists at a nearby café observe the remains of the giant marlin and mistake it for a shark. Manolin, who has been worried sick over the old man’s absence, is moved to tears when he finds Santiago safe in his bed. The boy fetches the old man some coffee and the daily papers with the baseball scores, and watches him sleep. When the old man wakes, the two agree to fish as partners once more. The old man returns to sleep and dreams his usual dream of lions at play on the beaches of Africa."
Its,"When the novel opens, Lily Bloom sits on the roof of a building in Boston, looking out at the city and the stars, thinking about death. She’s just come from her father’s funeral. She’s reflecting on how much she resents her father for abusing her mother when a man joins her on the roof and starts angrily kicking a patio chair. The man, Ryle Kincaid, is a neurosurgeon, and the two begin to flirt and tell each other increasingly intimate “naked truths.” Ryle reveals that he lost a child patient because the child’s brother shot him accidentally. Lily tells Ryle that she gave the eulogy at her abusive father’s funeral and couldn’t think of anything nice to say, so she stood there for two minutes in purposeful silence. Lily also tells Ryle she lost her virginity to a homeless boy named Atlas. Ryle tells Lily he wants to sleep with her, but he only has one-night stands and never wants to get married or have children. Though Lily is interested in Ryle, she can’t imagine having sex without it leading to a relationship. 
Six months later, Lily uses her inheritance to buy a storefront to convert into a flower shop. A woman named Allysa offers to work for Lily, and the two become fast friends. Lily and Allysa are cleaning up the storefront when Lily falls and hurts her ankle. Allysa calls her husband Marshall and her brother for help. When Allysa’s brother arrives, Lily sees that it’s Ryle. They pretend not to know each other for Allysa’s sake, but Ryle tells Lily that he still wants to sleep with her. They decide they need to stay away from each other because they want different things. As Lily recovers from her sprained ankle for a week, she reads her teenage journals, which were written as letters addressed to Ellen DeGeneres. They tell the story of Atlas and Lily. 
As a teenager, Lily notices a boy is living in an abandoned house behind hers. She feels for Atlas and begins to leave him food, lend him her father’s clothes, and let him shower at her house. The two become closer and begin to fall in love, and Atlas becomes a confidant and protector for Lily when her father hurts her and her mother. The two watch Ellen and Finding Nemo together and tell each other to “just keep swimming” when times get tough, quoting a line from the movie. Atlas learns a family member can take him in in Boston, and though Lily dreads it, Atlas moves away to find more stability. She’s heartbroken, but he returns on her 16th birthday. He gives her a magnet that says that everything is better in Boston. They make love for the first time. Atlas promises to come for Lily when he feels that his life is good enough for her. Then Lily’s father walks in on them. He savagely beats Atlas with a baseball bat. Atlas is taken away in an ambulance. This is the last time Lily sees Atlas, and throughout her life, she wonders why Atlas never came back for her.
Back in the present, Ryle pursues Lily, and after trying to get her to have sex with him, he admits he has feelings for her. Lily insists they not have sex and try dating, since she doesn’t trust him to have a relationship with her. They quickly start falling for each other. After they have been dating for a bit, Ryle invites himself to dinner with Lily and her mom. At dinner, Lily sees Atlas working at the restaurant. She’s shocked. During a brief conversation, Atlas tells Lily he has a girlfriend but that he wishes they had run into each other a year ago. Lily doesn’t tell Ryle that she ran into Atlas and tries to avoid going back to the restaurant again. One night, when Ryle and Lily are hanging out, Ryle burns himself on a casserole dish he tries to take out of the oven without a mitt. When Lily laughs, Ryle pushes her, and she hits her head. She’s bleeding, and she feels horrified and heartbroken, immediately worrying she’s turned into her mother. He’s quickly apologetic and eventually she forgives him, saying that if anything violent happens again, she’ll leave him.
They go to dinner with Allysa and Marshall at the same restaurant where Atlas works to celebrate that Allysa and Marshall are going to have a baby. Atlas comes to the table and the waiter introduces him as the chef. Atlas notices that both Lily and Ryle are injured and intuits that Ryle hurt her. When they are alone, Atlas tells Lily to leave Ryle. When she refuses, he says she’s like her mother. Ryle sees them together, and he learns that the chef is Atlas, the boy from Lily’s past. It comes to blows and Atlas throws Ryle out of his restaurant. Lily assures Ryle that nothing is going on between her and Atlas. They enjoy a period of peace and decide to get married in Vegas. But Ryle’s jealousy continues to simmer. When Ryle discovers that Atlas has given Lily his phone number, he flies into a jealous rage and pushes Lily down the stairs. She’s badly injured. When Allysa finds out what happened, she insists Ryle tell Lily about his past. He confesses that, just like the young patient he lost the night they met, his brother died of a gunshot wound because Ryle accidentally shot him. He marks this as the origin of his rage. Lily forgives him, and they try to be together again.
Allysa and Marshall have a baby and name her after Ryle. The night Rylee is born, Lily comes home to find Ryle in a strange mood. He makes her read an article in the newspaper in which Atlas mentions a woman who is special to him and says that the name of his restaurant (Bib’s) means “Better in Boston.” Ryle has the magnet in his hand and has read all of Lily’s teenage journals. He attempts to rape Lily and headbutts her so hard she blacks out. She calls Atlas to come get her, and he takes her to the hospital, where she discovers she’s pregnant. She takes her time figuring out what she wants for her life, confused by her emotions for Atlas and by all her conflicting feelings of rage and love and hurt for Ryle. She gradually lets Ryle back into her life in a platonic way, telling him about the baby, though she’s unsure what she wants from him. 
When the baby is born, Lily and Ryle name her Emerson, after Ryle’s brother. Lily says she wants a divorce because she would never want her daughter to endure what she and her mother did. Ryle agrees, though he is heartbroken about it. They share custody of Emerson. One day, Lily runs into Atlas. He says his life is good enough for Lily now, so if she’s ever ready to fall in love again, he’s there for her. She says she’s ready, and they embrace. He says she can stop swimming."
Contention,"The protagonist, who is named Tim O’Brien, begins by describing an event that occurred in the middle of his Vietnam experience. “The Things They Carried” catalogs the variety of things his fellow soldiers in the Alpha Company brought on their missions. Several of these things are intangible, including guilt and fear, while others are specific physical objects, including matches, morphine, M-16 rifles, and M&M’s candy.
Throughout the collection, the same characters reappear in various stories. The first member of the Alpha Company to die is Ted Lavender, a “grunt,” or low-ranking soldier, who deals with his anxiety about the war by taking tranquilizers and smoking marijuana. Lavender is shot in the head on his way back from going to the bathroom, and his superior, Lieutenant Jimmy Cross, blames himself for the tragedy. When Lavender is shot, Cross is distracting himself with thoughts of Martha, a college crush. It is revealed in “Love” that Cross’s feelings for Martha, whom he dated once before leaving for Vietnam, were never reciprocated, and that even twenty years after the war, his guilt over Lavender’s death remains.
In “On the Rainy River,” the narrator, O’Brien, explains the series of events that led him to Vietnam in the first place. He receives his draft notice in June of 1968, and his feelings of confusion drive him north to the Canadian border, which he contemplates crossing so that he will not be forced to fight in a war in which he doesn’t believe. Sitting in a rowboat with the proprietor of the Tip Top Lodge, where he stays, O’Brien decides that his guilt about avoiding the war and fear of disappointing his family are more important than his political convictions. He soon leaves, going first back home to Worthington, Minnesota and later to Vietnam.
In addition to Ted Lavender, a few other members of the Alpha Company are killed during their mission overseas, including Curt Lemon, who is killed when he steps on a rigged mortar round. Though O’Brien is not close to Lemon, in “The Dentist,” he tells a story of how Lemon, who faints before a routine checkup with an army-issued dentist, tries to save face by insisting that a perfectly good tooth be pulled. Lee Strunk, another member of the company, dies from injuries he sustains by stepping on a landmine. In “Friends,” O’Brien remembers that before Strunk was fatally hurt, Strunk and Dave Jensen had made a pact that if either man were irreparably harmed, the other man would see that he was quickly killed. However, when Strunk is actually hurt, he begs Jensen to spare him, and Jensen complies. Instead of being upset by the news of his friend’s swift death en route to treatment, Jensen is relieved.
The death that receives the most attention in The Things They Carried is that of Kiowa, a much-loved member of the Alpha Company and one of O’Brien’s closest friends. In “Speaking of Courage,” the story of Kiowa’s death is relayed in retrospect through the memory of Norman Bowker, years after the war. As Bowker drives around a lake in his Iowa hometown, he thinks that he failed to save Kiowa, who was killed when a mortar round hit and caused him to sink headfirst into a marshy field. O’Brien realizes that he has dealt with his guilt over Kiowa’s death differently than Norman Bowker in “Notes.” Just before the end of the war, O’Brien receives a long letter from Bowker that says he hasn’t found a way to make life meaningful after the war. O’Brien resolves to tell Bowker’s story, and the story of Kiowa’s death, in order to negotiate his own feelings of guilt and hollowness.
Like “Love” and “Notes,” several of O’Brien’s stories are told from a perspective twenty years after the Vietnam War, when he is a forty-three-year-old writer living in Massachusetts. Exposure to the guilt of old friends like Jimmy Cross and Norman Bowker prompts him to write stories in order to understand what they were going through. But two stories, “The Man I Killed” and “Ambush,” are written so that O’Brien can confront his own guilt over killing a man with a grenade outside the village of My Khe. In “The Man I Killed,” O’Brien imagines the life of his victim, from his childhood to the way things would have turned out for him had O’Brien not spotted him on a path and thrown a grenade at his feet. In “Ambush,” O’Brien imagines how he might relay the story of the man he killed to his nine-year-old daughter, Kathleen. In this second story, O’Brien provides more details of the actual killing—including the sound of the grenade and his own feelings—and explains that even well after the fact, he hasn’t finished sorting out the experience.
In the last story, “The Lives of the Dead,” O’Brien gives another twist to his contention that stories have the power to save people. In the stories of Curt Lemon and Kiowa, O’Brien explains that his imagination allowed him to grapple successfully with his guilt and confusion over the death of his fourth-grade first love, Linda."
Harbor,"Refugee follows the stories of three different children and their families, each attempting to flee their violent homelands, in different regions of the world and during different decades. Josef and his family flee Nazi Germany in 1938; Isabel and her family flee Cuba in 1994; and Mahmoud and his family flee Syria in 2015.
Josef Landau is a twelve-year-old boy living in Berlin. In 1938, his home is raided by Nazi storm troopers, and his father is taken to the Dachau concentration camp. Six months later, his mother receives a telegram that her husband has been released, but the family must leave Germany immediately. Josef, his sister Ruth, and his mother all travel to Hamburg to board a ship that will take them to Cuba. When Josef’s father is reunited with his family, they notice that Dachau has changed him: he is paranoid and very thin. They board the St. Louis, a large German ship, and set out.
Aboard the St. Louis, Josef’s family and the other passengers, all Jewish refugees, are treated well by Captain Schroeder and most of the ship’s crew. A few of the crew, however, openly dislike the Jewish passengers, especially Otto Schiendick, who proudly states his Nazi allegiance. When the St. Louis reaches Havana Harbor in Cuba, the ship is not allowed to dock. Josef’s father’s mental state deteriorates further, and he eventually jumps from the ship, trying to kill himself. Officer Padron, a Cuban policeman assigned to the St. Louis, saves Josef’s father. Josef’s father is taken to Havana to recover. When Officer Padron returns to the St. Louis, he is treated like a hero by the Jewish passengers. 
Eventually, the captain announces that they are not going to be allowed to dock in Havana and that the boat will be leaving. He promises the passengers that he will try to deliver them to a country other than Germany. The refugees aboard the St. Louis are delivered to England, Belgium, the Netherlands, and France. The Nazis invade France just a few months after Josef’s family arrives there. When the family is eventually caught, Josef’s mother is forced to choose which of her children will be freed and which will be sent to a concentration camp.
Isabel Fernandez is an eleven-year-old girl who lives just outside Havana in 1994. After the fall of the Soviet Union, Cuba has become inhospitable for most of its citizens under the regime of Fidel Castro. Isabel’s best friend and neighbor, Iván, is building a small boat with his father so that his family can flee to America. After a riot in Havana, Isabel’s family decides that they should also leave Cuba immediately. Isabel trades her trumpet to a fisherman for gasoline, paying her family’s way onto Iván’s family’s boat. Lito, Isabel’s grandfather, also joins them. 
The two families face many challenges as they try to cross the Caribbean Sea to Florida. A storm sweeps them to the Bahamas, where they are not allowed to disembark; Iván is attacked by sharks and eventually bleeds to death in the boat; and toward the end of the journey, Isabel’s pregnant mother goes into labor. Lito tells the story of the St. Louis and how he had to turn away so many refugees when he was a young policeman. (He is Officer Padron from Josef’s story.) Just when Miami becomes visible on the horizon, a U.S. Coast Guard boat tries to intercept the two families. Lito jumps in the water to distract the Coast Guard, and Isabel’s mother gives birth to a boy, just as they reach the shore. When Isabel is asked to play a song at her new school in America, she plays a Cuban salsa version of “The Star-Spangled Banner.”
Mahmoud Bishara is a twelve-year-old boy who lives in Aleppo, Syria in 2015. For the last few years, there has been a war in his country between the Syrian government, rebels, the Soviets, the United States and several other factions. After Mahmoud’s home is destroyed, his brother Waleed, sister Hana, and his parents drive to the border of Turkey, hoping to escape. Mahmoud’s father tells them that Germany is accepting Syrian refugees and if they can get to Greece, they will be able to travel within the European Union to reach Germany. After a violent conflict between the rebels and the Syrian government, Mahmoud and his family walk to the Turkish border. Mahmoud’s father arranges for a smuggler to take them to the island of Lesbos, in Greece. The smuggler’s raft is destroyed by rocks as they cross the Mediterranean. Mahmoud hands his sister, Hana, to another passing raft of refugees, knowing that his mother cannot hold her and swim. The family is eventually pulled from the water by the Greek Coast Guard. 
Mahmoud and his family travel through Serbia and into Hungary, where they are detained at a refugee camp that is built like a prison. Mahmoud decides that he no longer wants to be ignored and leads the refugees out of the prison, walking twelve hours to Austria. The refugees are welcomed in Austria, and Mahmoud’s family takes a train to Germany. While they travel, they ask if anyone has seen Hana. After a few weeks in Munich, Mahmoud’s family is transferred to a host family in Berlin. An elderly couple, Herr and Frau Rosenberg, welcome them into their home. Frau Rosenberg takes Mahmoud aside and tells him the story of her childhood: she is Ruth, Josef’s sister. The night that they were captured in France, Josef volunteered to be taken by the Nazis; both Josef and their mother were killed in concentration camps. Ruth promises to help Mahmoud find Hana."
Carries,"Carrie White’s peers don’t know much about her, but they do know that they don’t like the plain, socially awkward girl who lives alone with her odd mother. Now seniors at Ewen High School in the small Maine town of Chamberlain, most of Carrie’s peers have gone to school with Carrie for years. During that time, they have continually tormented her with cat calls and pranks, and their teasing comes to a tipping point one day in the locker room after gym class when Carrie starts her period and is oblivious to that fact. The girls pounce on Carrie’s weakness and taunt her with their cruel words while showering her with a rain of feminine products.
When Carrie learns what menstruation is and that all women experience it, she becomes angry with her mother, Margaret White, who has withheld this information even though Carrie is sixteen years old. On this same day, Carrie also learns that she is telekinetic, which means that she has the ability to move objects with her mind. She has a dim memory of having done this before, but the sudden onset of her period fully unleashes this power along with the memories of her childhood and the time that she made stones rain down upon her house. Carrie’s peers don’t know that she has the gene for telekinesis, or TK, but Margaret has long suspected that her daughter possesses the “devil’s power.” Margaret constantly watches for sin in her daughter and in others and has brought up Carrie to do the same. She educates Carrie on the sins of womanhood on the day that Carrie gets her period.
The fallout from the incident in the locker room has consequences for the other girls, who must attend a week of detention or forfeit their tickets to the upcoming Spring Ball. The ringleader, Chris Hargensen, is furious when she loses her tickets and seeks revenge on Carrie. Sue Snell, another girl who joined in the jeering, feels remorse about her role in it and enlists her boyfriend, Tommy Ross, to ask Carrie to the prom as a gesture of apology. Sue plans to stay home on prom night.
After Tommy asks Carrie to the prom and she accepts, Chris enlists her boyfriend, Billy Nolan, to help her formulate and execute her plan for revenge. Chris sneaks a look at the seating plan for prom and finds out that Tommy and Carrie are on the ballot for King and Queen. Billy and his friends travel to a local farm where they slaughter two sows and drain the blood into two buckets.
Margaret is furious that Carrie is going to prom and appalled by the sexy red dress that Carrie has made for herself. She and Carrie fight but Carrie uses her TK to keep her mother at bay. When Tommy picks Carrie up, he tells Carrie he is dazzled by her beauty. At the prom, Carrie comes out of her shell enough to talk to some new people and enjoy herself, and when she and Tommy win prom King and Queen, she allows herself to enjoy that victory as well.
When Tommy and Carrie are onstage being crowned, Chris pulls a rope that is connected to the two buckets of pig’s blood balanced in the rafters. The contents of the buckets pour all over Tommy, Carrie, and the stage. One of the buckets comes down and hits Tommy in the head, knocking him unconscious and ultimately killing him. All the students laugh at Carrie as she stands on stage covered in blood, and she runs out of the gym, humiliated. A few moments later, the doors to the gym slam shut, and some people see Carrie’s smiling face looking back at them through the glass. In a fit of rage, Carrie uses her TK to turn on the fire sprinklers and loosen the electrical wires in the gym. Students are electrocuted and some burst into flames.
Carrie heads into town where she dismantles several fire hydrants so the school fires cannot be put out and unlocks the pumps at the gas station. Not long afterward, the school explodes. Before Carrie heads home, she loosens the electrical wiring along the streets, killing several people in town. All the while, she has been broadcasting a telepathic message to the townspeople that she is responsible for the chaos and death. At home, Carrie finds Margaret waiting for her with a butcher knife. Margaret believes Carrie is possessed and plunges the knife into Carrie’s shoulder. Carrie uses her TK to slow the beating of Margaret’s heart until it stops.
Chris and Billy had gone to a roadhouse outside of town after the buckets fell, but when they learn of the destruction in town, they race around to cover their tracks. They don’t get very far before they see Carrie, who flips the car they are driving into the wall of the roadhouse where its gas tank explodes. Sue Snell, who has been following Carrie’s trail since she saw the school explode, finds Carrie unconscious in the roadhouse parking lot. They speak to each other using only their minds, and Carrie realizes that Sue was not part of the prank and is innocent regarding Carrie’s humiliating experience. Sue stays with Carrie in the final moments before Carrie’s death."
Sworn,"A Game of Thrones takes place over the course of one year on or near the fictional continent of Westeros. The story begins when King Robert visits the northern castle Winterfell to ask Ned Stark to be his right-hand assistant, or Hand of the King. The previous Hand, Jon Arryn, died under suspicious circumstances. Robert comes with his queen, Cersei Lannister, and his retinue, which includes a number of Lannisters. Just after the royal party arrives, Ned’s wife, Catelyn, receives a message claiming that the Lannister family was responsible for the death of the former Hand. She tells Ned, who accepts the position as Hand in order to protect Robert from the Lannisters. Ned’s son Bran then discovers Cersei Lannister and her brother Jaime Lannister having sex, and Jaime pushes Bran from a window to silence him. Everyone thinks Bran simply fell while climbing around the castle.
While Bran is still unconscious, Ned leaves Winterfell and rides south with Robert. The same day, Ned’s bastard son, Jon, leaves to serve at the Wall, a massive structure that protects Westeros from the wilderness of the far North. The group of men sworn to defend the Wall, the Night’s Watch, have been receiving reports of strange creatures and have been losing men with increasing frequency. Tyrion Lannister, a little person who is brother to Cersei and Jaime, travels with Jon to the Wall to see the massive structure. Meanwhile, on a continent east of Westeros, Daenerys Targaryen marries the warlord Khal Drogo, one of the leaders of the Dothraki people. Daenerys and her brother Viserys are the last surviving members of the family Robert defeated to become king, the Targaryens. They are an old family said to be descended from dragons, and Viserys thinks with Khal Drogo’s army he can retake the throne. A knight named Ser Jorah Mormont, exiled by Ned Stark, pledges he will help. Daenerys receives three dragon eggs as a wedding gift and becomes immediately fascinated by them.
On the trip south to the capital, called King’s Landing, Robert and Cersei’s son, Joffrey, and Ned’s daughter Sansa, who everyone presumes will be married one day, go for a walk. When Joffrey sees Arya, Ned’s other daughter and sister to Sansa, practicing her swordfighting with a boy, he decides to show them he’s a better fighter. As pets, all of the Stark children have direwolf pups, a wolf breed larger than normal wolves that also happens to be the symbol of the Stark house, and Arya’s wolf injures Joffrey defending her. Though Sansa knows Joffrey instigated the fight, she will not tell on Joffrey because she’s in love with him. As punishment, Cersei wants Arya’s wolf killed, but since it ran away after hurting Joffrey, Cersei demands that Ned kill Sansa’s wolf instead. Meanwhile, an assassin tries to kill the unconscious Bran and fails. Ned finally reaches King’s Landing to find that Catelyn has sailed to the city in secret to discover the truth about the assassin. She has the dagger the assassin used, and after examining it, Catelyn’s childhood friend Littlefinger recognizes it as belonging to Tyrion Lannister. Ned tells Catelyn he will try to determine who killed the former Hand, Jon Arryn, and who tried to kill Bran. Bran finally wakes from his coma, but he doesn’t remember how he fell. Tyrion visits him on his way south from the Wall to deliver a greeting from Jon. Tyrion continues south as Catelyn starts back north, and when their paths cross Catelyn has him seized for trying to kill Bran.
In King’s Landing, Ned slowly begins to unravel the mystery of why the previous Hand was killed. He knows it has to do with something the Hand learned about King Robert’s children. Through a spy, Robert learns that Daenerys Targaryen is pregnant. He wants to assassinate her because he fears she and her son will one day challenge Robert’s right to the throne. Disgusted with Robert’s plan, Ned resigns as Hand. That night, Jaime and his men confront Ned about Tyrion’s capture. Jaime kills Ned’s men and Ned breaks his leg while fighting. The following day, Robert reinstates Ned as Hand. While Robert is gone hunting, Ned orders the execution of a rogue knight loyal to the Lannister family who has been pillaging villages. Further north, Catelyn takes Tyrion to her sister Lysa Arryn’s castle, the Eyrie, which is in a mountainous area called The Vale. Lysa accuses Tyrion of arranging the murder of both Jon Arryn and Bran. Tyrion denies the accusations and demands a trial by combat. A knight fights on Lysa’s behalf, and a mercenary fights on Tyrion’s behalf. Tyrion’s mercenary wins. While Tyrion rides from the Eyrie, a group of mountain clansmen try to kill him, but he promises to help them take The Vale and convinces them to join him.
In the east, as Khal Drogo and his Dothraki followers head back to Vaes Dothrak, their capital, Viserys becomes increasingly angry that Drogo has not provided him with an army with which to wage war on Westeros. During a feast he attacks Daenerys in a rage, and Khal Drogo has Viserys killed by dumping molten gold on his head. In King’s Landing, Ned has figured out why the Hand was killed: he had discovered that Joffrey was not really Robert’s child but was actually the product of Cersei’s sexual relationship with her brother, Jaime. Robert doesn’t know the truth. Robert is mortally wounded in a hunt, and before he dies, he names Ned the Protector of the Realm, essentially an interim king, until Joffrey comes of age. Ned does not tell Robert that he knows Joffrey is not the true heir, since he is the son of Cersei and Jaime. Ned asks Littlefinger’s help to install the true heir, Robert’s brother Stannis, as the king, and Littlefinger agrees. But when Ned confronts the Lannisters, saying that Joffrey is not the true heir and expecting Littlefinger’s support, Littlefinger betrays him, and Cersei imprisons Ned for treason. Meanwhile, north of the Wall, Jon and other men have discovered two strange dead bodies. They bring the bodies back for examination, and late at night, one of the bodies comes to life and tries to kill Jon’s commander. Jon and his direwolf fight off the undead body, and Jon kills the creature with fire.
After Ned’s capture, Arya escapes the castle in King’s Landing and Cersei holds Sansa hostage (she says she is holding Sansa for her own protection). Tywin Lannister, father to Tyrion, Cersei, and Jaime, wages war with Catelyn and her son, Robb Stark. Shrewdly outmaneuvering Tywin, Robb manages to defeat a portion of the Lannister army and capture Jaime. In King’s Landing, Joffrey, who is considered Robert’s heir, is crowned King. In the hopes that he can prevent his daughters being harmed, Ned confesses publicly to treason, and Joffrey has him executed while Sansa watches. Arya is in the crowd, though nobody knows it.
Learning of his father’s death and his brother’s march to war, Jon tries to desert the Wall. Jon’s friends convince him that he must stay and defend the Wall as he vowed. In the east, Drogo suffers a wound while raiding a village. Daenerys has one of the village women treat him, but he becomes very sick. When he is about to die, Daenerys asks the woman to heal him, but she says only bloodmagic will save him and it will require a death in exchange for his life. Despite the protests of the Dothraki people, Daenerys has the woman do it. Shortly thereafter Daenerys goes into labor. When she wakes many days later, her child is dead and Drogo is alive but brain dead. His followers have all left, leaving behind only a few warriors, the sick and old, and Ser Jorah Mormont, who has become one of Daenerys’s most trusted advisors. Daenerys sets a funeral pyre to burn Drogo and the woman, who tricked her and essentially killed her husband and child. Daenerys also places the three dragon eggs into the pyre. As the fire burns, Daenerys walks into it, and when finally it clears, Mormont and the Dothrakis find her with three newborn dragons at her breast."
Enemies,"The town in which the play is set has built a huge bathing complex that is crucial to the town's economy. Dr. Stockmann has just discovered that the baths' drainage system is seriously contaminated. He alerts several members of the community, including Hovstad and Aslaksen, and receives generous support and thanks for making his discovery in time to save the town. The next morning, however, his brother, who is also the town's mayor, tells him that he must retract his statements, for the necessary repairs would be too expensive; additionally, the mayor is not convinced by Dr. Stockmann's findings. The brothers have a fierce argument, but Dr. Stockmann hopes that at least Hovstad's newspaper will support him. However, the mayor convinces Hovstad and Aslaksen to oppose Dr. Stockmann.
The doctor holds a town meeting to give a lecture on the baths, but Aslaksen and the mayor try to keep him from speaking. Dr. Stockmann then begins a long tirade in which he condemns the foundations of the town and the tyranny of the majority. The audience finds his speech incredibly offensive, and the next morning the doctor's home is vandalized. He and his daughter are fired. The mayor insinuates that the doctor's actions were merely a scheme to inherit more of Morten Kiil's money, and Kiil himself soon arrives to suggest just such a plan to Dr. Stockmann. However, the doctor refuses all such suggestions and decides to defy authority and remain in town. His family is supportive, and he says that the strongest man is the man who stands alone."
Times,"Thomas Gradgrind, a wealthy, retired merchant in the industrial city of Coketown, England, devotes his life to a philosophy of rationalism, self-interest, and fact. He raises his oldest children, Louisa and Tom, according to this philosophy and never allows them to engage in fanciful or imaginative pursuits. He founds a school and charitably takes in one of the students, the kindly and imaginative Sissy Jupe, after the disappearance of her father, a circus entertainer.
	As the Gradgrind children grow older, Tom becomes a dissipated, self-interested hedonist, and Louisa struggles with deep inner confusion, feeling as though she is missing something important in her life. Eventually Louisa marries Gradgrind’s friend Josiah Bounderby, a wealthy factory owner and banker more than twice her age. Bounderby continually trumpets his role as a self-made man who was abandoned in the gutter by his mother as an infant. Tom is apprenticed at the Bounderby bank, and Sissy remains at the Gradgrind home to care for the younger children.
	In the meantime, an impoverished “Hand”—Dickens’s term for the lowest laborers in Coketown’s factories—named Stephen Blackpool struggles with his love for Rachael, another poor factory worker. He is unable to marry her because he is already married to a horrible, drunken woman who disappears for months and even years at a time. Stephen visits Bounderby to ask about a divorce but learns that only the wealthy can obtain them. Outside Bounderby’s home, he meets Mrs. Pegler, a strange old woman with an inexplicable devotion to Bounderby.
	James Harthouse, a wealthy young sophisticate from London, arrives in Coketown to begin a political career as a disciple of Gradgrind, who is now a Member of Parliament. He immediately takes an interest in Louisa and decides to try to seduce her. With the unspoken aid of Mrs. Sparsit, a former aristocrat who has fallen on hard times and now works for Bounderby, he sets about trying to corrupt Louisa.
	The Hands, exhorted by a crooked union spokesman named Slackbridge, try to form a union. Only Stephen refuses to join because he feels that a union strike would only increase tensions between employers and employees. He is cast out by the other Hands and fired by Bounderby when he refuses to spy on them. Louisa, impressed with Stephen’s integrity, visits him before he leaves Coketown and helps him with some money. Tom accompanies her and tells Stephen that if he waits outside the bank for several consecutive nights, help will come to him. Stephen does so, but no help arrives. Eventually he packs up and leaves Coketown, hoping to find agricultural work in the country. Not long after that, the bank is robbed, and the lone suspect is Stephen, the vanished Hand who was seen loitering outside the bank for several nights just before disappearing from the city.
	Mrs. Sparsit witnesses Harthouse declaring his love for Louisa, and Louisa agrees to meet him in Coketown later that night. However, Louisa instead flees to her father’s house, where she miserably confides to Gradgrind that her upbringing has left her married to a man she does not love, disconnected from her feelings, deeply unhappy, and possibly in love with Harthouse. She collapses to the floor, and Gradgrind, struck dumb with self-reproach, begins to realize the imperfections in his philosophy of rational self-interest.
	Sissy, who loves Louisa deeply, visits Harthouse and convinces him to leave Coketown forever. Bounderby, furious that his wife has left him, redoubles his efforts to capture Stephen. When Stephen tries to return to clear his good name, he falls into a mining pit called Old Hell Shaft. Rachael and Louisa discover him, but he dies soon after an emotional farewell to Rachael. Gradgrind and Louisa realize that Tom is really responsible for robbing the bank, and they arrange to sneak him out of England with the help of the circus performers with whom Sissy spent her early childhood. They are nearly successful, but are stopped by Bitzer, a young man who went to Gradgrind’s school and who embodies all the qualities of the detached rationalism that Gradgrind once espoused, but who now sees its limits. Sleary, the lisping circus proprietor, arranges for Tom to slip out of Bitzer’s grasp, and the young robber escapes from England after all.
	Mrs. Sparsit, anxious to help Bounderby find the robbers, drags Mrs. Pegler—a known associate of Stephen Blackpool—in to see Bounderby, thinking Mrs. Pegler is a potential witness. Bounderby recoils, and it is revealed that Mrs. Pegler is really his loving mother, whom he has forbidden to visit him: Bounderby is not a self-made man after all. Angrily, Bounderby fires Mrs. Sparsit and sends her away to her hostile relatives. Five years later, he will die alone in the streets of Coketown. Gradgrind gives up his philosophy of fact and devotes his political power to helping the poor. Tom realizes the error of his ways but dies without ever seeing his family again. While Sissy marries and has a large and loving family, Louisa never again marries and never has children. Nevertheless, Louisa is loved by Sissy’s family and learns at last how to feel sympathy for her fellow human beings."
Conditions,"Tambu, the narrator, is unmoved by the death of her brother, Nhamo. The afternoon he is expected home at the end of his term at the mission school, he does not arrive. He dislikes taking the bus and then walking the rest of the way through the countryside to the family’s homestead. Tambu is relieved at his absence, as she does not have to kill and prepare a chicken to celebrate his return.
Tambu then reflects on the events leading up to her brother’s death. Despite the family’s poverty, Tambu’s parents were able to raise the fees to send Nhamo to school. There was not enough money to send Tambu as well, so she decided to grow and sell vegetables and raise the money herself. When she discovered that her brother was stealing food from her garden patch, she attempted to beat him up while the two were attending Sunday school. Tambu’s teacher, Mr. Matimba, took her to Umtali, a local urban center, to sell green ears of corn. A white woman, Doris, and her husband pitied Tambu and gave Mr. Matimba ten pounds sterling to pay for her education.
The extended family gathered to celebrate the return of Babamukuru, his wife, Maiguru, and their two children, Chido and Nyasha, back from studying abroad in England. Chido and Nyasha, Tambu’s cousins, had lost the ability to speak their native tongue, Shona. Maiguru did not want them participating in the dancing and other festive activities. At the end of the meal, Tambu was ordered to bring a bowl of water to each member of the extended family so they could wash their hands. Babamukuru’s three siblings praised his success. He proposed educating a member of each family, focusing especially on the neediest branch, Tambu’s clan. They chose Nhamo to go to the mission school, but after his sudden death, Tambu is selected to replace him.
Tambu, returning her focus to the present, is excited and awed by her new life in her aunt and uncle’s house on the mission school grounds. Maiguru warmly welcomes Tambu into her new home. She serves Tambu tea and pastries and gives her an entirely new wardrobe, all in preparation for her first day of school. The coldness and emotional distance that once existed between Nyasha and Tambu quickly disappear. Tambu becomes absorbed in her studies. She soon learns the rhythms of the household, witnessing Nyasha and Babamukuru’s frequent fights. She also learns that Maiguru is highly educated.
To mark the end of the term, Nyasha, Tambu, and the children of white missionaries attend a dance. Tambu reluctantly joins the festivities. At the end of the evening, Nyasha resists coming inside, still trying to master a new dance one of the boys is teaching her. When the young people finally enter the house, a violent argument erupts between Babamukuru and Nyasha, in which Babamukuru accuses Nyasha of lewd behavior. Nyasha strikes her father, who vows to kill her for performing the taboo act of assaulting her own parent. Nyasha grows more detached in the following weeks, and Tambu tries to help assuage her guilt.
During the school vacation, Tambu and her relatives head back to the homestead. Maiguru laments the fact that, as senior wife, she is expected to cook and clean for the extended family the entire time. Babamukuru is upset to find Lucia, Tambu’s mother’s sister, and Takesure, a relative of Tambu’s father, still living at the homestead. To make matters worse, Lucia is pregnant with Takesure’s child. A family meeting is held to decide what course of action should be taken. Ultimately the couple is allowed to remain, as Babamukuru shifts his focus to another moral issue that rankles him: his own brother’s unsanctified domestic status. Babamukuru declares that Jeremiah and Ma’Shingayi must be married in a formal Christian ceremony as soon as possible.
Tambu’s mother comes to the mission hospital and gives birth to a son. Lucia soon follows and asks Babamukuru to find her a job, which he does. She cooks at the school and begins taking classes. Preparations are being made for the impending nuptials. When it comes time to leave, Tambu, who is vehemently opposed to her parents’ wedding, feigns illness. When Babamukuru tells her to be ready in thirty minutes, she refuses to attend. When he returns from the wedding, he punishes her by lashing her and forcing her to perform the maid’s duties for two weeks. Maiguru argues with Babamukuru over the lack of respect that she gets and the fact that her economic contribution to the family is not recognized. She leaves the next day and stays with her son, Chido.
While the girls are preparing for final exams, nuns arrive at the mission and administer a test. Tambu is offered a scholarship to study at the esteemed mission school. At first, Babamukuru is opposed to her accepting the offer, but he eventually relents. Home for the holiday, Tambu finds her mother ill. Lucia arrives and nurses her sister back to health. When Tambu returns to the mission and prepares to leave for the convent school, she cannot find Nyasha anywhere. When she finally finds Nyasha, Nyasha is cold toward her, upset that her best friend will soon be leaving and she will be left alone with her unsympathetic father.
Tambu leaves for the convent school, where she shares a crowded room with other African girls. Busy with her studies, she soon falls out of touch with Nyasha. Tambu returns to the mission to find Nyasha changed, frightfully thin and suffering from a severe eating disorder. One night, Nyasha has what appears to be a psychotic episode. Nyasha sees a psychiatrist and slowly regains her health. Tambu fears she is succumbing to the negative, colonial influence that made Nyasha mentally ill. Her other cousin, Chido, has a white girlfriend, much to Maiguru’s chagrin. Tambu declares her intention to begin questioning her world and the influences that it exerts on her."
Exploit,"In a brief preface, C.S. Lewis says he discovered the bundle of Screwtape’s letters somewhere, but will not say how he managed to come across them. Screwtape is a devil, he warns the reader, and Screwtape’s version of events, therefore, should not be taken as the truth. Then the letters begin. In them, Screwtape advises his nephew, Wormwood, on how best to tempt a British man, called only “the Patient,” into sin and, eventually, into Hell. Wormwood is an inexperienced devil, and he hasgone to a training college to help prepare him to tempt humans into sin. Screwtape complains, however, that this college has taught Wormwood nothing because of its incompetent director, Slubgob. By the second letter, readers learn that the Patient has converted to Christianity and has begun going to church. The Patient is most likely in his mid-thirties and he lives with and takes care of his aging mother.
The Patient’s mother is a difficult woman. She makes many demands on the Patient’s time and energy. In the early letters, Screwtape advises Wormwood to make the Patient think that being Christian is an internal, spiritual thing rather than an external way of being in the world. After the Patient prays, Wormwood should make him fight with his mother about insignificant details about the house and chores. Over the course of these early letters, the dynamic between Screwtape and Wormwood begins to take shape. Wormwood keeps himself invisible as he follows the Patient around on Earth.  He essentially whispers in the Patient’s ear, encouraging the Patient to experience negative emotions and to pursue unhealthy distractions. Unlike Wormwood, Screwtape is an experienced tempter. He has already won souls for Hell. This has earned him, it seems, a mid-management position in Hell’s vast “Lowerarchy”—a devilish corporation that determines how best to organize Hell’s temptation strategies on Earth.
After World War II begins, the Patient worries about whether he will be drafted. Screwtape advises Wormwood to exploit the Patient’s uncertainty, and soon, there is a period of relative inactivity during the war. During this time, Patient makes new, unnamed friends. These friends, however, are not Christians. They are skeptical and worldly. Screwtape advises Wormwood to make the Patient a hypocrite. The Patient should think he is better than his fellow, humble churchgoers because he has such smart and sophisticated friends, and he should think he is better than his friends because he, unlike them, is a Christian. As a result of the negative influence of these friends on the Patient, Wormwood, very briefly, seems to be doing a good job winning over the Patient’s soul. Soon, however, after reading a book and going on a walk by an old mill, the Patient experiences a reawakening of his faith. This reawakening amounts to a second conversion, and, during it, the Enemy—God—forms a barrier of grace around the Patient that appears to Wormwood as a noxious fog.
After the Patient’s second conversion, Screwtape advises Wormwood to tempt the Patient with sexual pleasures. Screwtape instructs Wormwood to make a list of all the young women in the Patient’s neighborhood that would prove to be bad marriages matches for the Patient. But the Patient falls in love withthe Woman. A Christian girl a Christian family, the Woman has a tremendously positive influence on the Patient’s life. Screwtape hates the Woman. During this time, Wormwood reports Screwtape to Hell’s secret police because Screwtape writes that the Enemy really loves humans. In Hell, this claim is heresy. It contradicts Hell’s essential teachingthat the Enemy’s love is a lie that the Enemy uses to mask His self-interest. Wormwood continues to make poor progress with the Patient and, during an episode of intense anger, Screwtape transforms into a giant centipede. This is a normal occurrence, he , an outward manifestation of his inner “Life Force.” is able to clear his name with Hell’s authorities by explaining that he was only speaking of the Enemy’s love for humans as an analogy for the Enemy’s incomprehensible preoccupation with humankind.
World War II, meanwhile, grows active again. The Germans begin to drop bombs on the Patient’s unnamed hometown. The Patient’s unspecified duties place him in harms way, and he soon begins to fear for his life. Screwtape advises Wormwood to exploit the Patient’s cowardice, but not to the extent that the Patient prays for help with it. During one bombing, the Patient acts according to his duty. Because he is afraid, however, the Patient feels himself to be a coward. This is bad news for Wormwood, Screwtape says. It keeps the Patient humble. Screwtape warns Wormwood that the Patient’s soul is prepared for Heaven, and he advises Wormwood to keep the Patient alive as long as possible. That way, Wormwood can use the Patient’s whole life to tempt him away from the Enemy and into sin. But the Patient dies during a German air raid, and his soul is taken into Heaven. Because of his failure, Wormwood must take the Patient’s place.  Wormwood begs Screwtape for mercy, but Screwtape laughs, saying there is no mercy in Hell. Screwtape concludes the final letter by saying how excited he is at the prospect of eating Wormwood alive."
Situation,"Revolutionary and incendiary, The Second Sex is one of the earliest attempts to confront human history from a feminist perspective. It won de Beauvoir many admirers and just as many detractors. Today, many regard this massive and meticulously researched masterwork as not only as pillar of feminist thought but of twentieth-century philosophy in general.
De Beauvoir’s primary thesis is that men fundamentally oppress women by characterizing them, on every level, as the Other, defined exclusively in opposition to men. Man occupies the role of the self, or subject; woman is the object, the other. He is essential, absolute, and transcendent. She is inessential, incomplete, and mutilated. He extends out into the world to impose his will on it, whereas woman is doomed to immanence, or inwardness. He creates, acts, invents; she waits for him to save her. This distinction is the basis of all de Beauvoir’s later arguments.
De Beauvoir states that while it is natural for humans to understand themselves in opposition to others, this process is flawed when applied to the genders. In defining woman exclusively as Other, man is effectively denying her humanity.
The Second Sex chronicles de Beauvoir’s effort to locate the source of these profoundly imbalanced gender roles. In Book I, entitled “Facts and Myths,” she asks how “female humans” come to occupy a subordinate position in society. To answer this question—and to better understand her own identity—de Beauvoir first turns to biology, psychoanalysis, and historical materialism. These disciplines reveal indisputable “essential” differences between men and women but provide no justification for woman’s inferiority. They all take woman’s inferior “destiny” for granted.
She then moves to history to trace the emergence of male superiority in society, from nomadic hunter-gatherers through the French Revolution and contemporary times. Here she finds ample examples of female subordination, but again, no persuasive justification for them. History, she argues, is not an immutable “fact,” but a reflection of certain attitudes, preconceptions, and injustices.
De Beauvoir next discusses various mythical representations of women and demonstrates how these myths have imprinted human consciousness, often to the disservice of women. De Beauvoir hopes to debunk the persistent myth of the “eternal feminine” by showing that it arose from male discomfort with the fact of his own birth. Throughout history, maternity has been both worshipped and reviled: the mother both brings life and heralds death. These mysterious operations get projected onto the woman, who is transformed into a symbol of “life” and in the process is robbed of all individuality. To illustrate the prevalence of these myths, de Beauvoir studies the portrayal of women by five modern writers. In the end of this section, de Beauvoir examines the impact of these myths on individual experience. She concludes that the “eternal feminine” fiction is reinforced by biology, psychoanalysis, history, and literature.
De Beauvoir insists on the impossibility of comparing the “character” of men and women without considering the immense differences in their situation, and in Book II, entitled “Woman’s Life Today,” she turns to the concrete realities of this situation. She traces female development through its formative stages: childhood, youth, and sexual initiation. Her goal is to prove that women are not born “feminine” but shaped by a thousand external processes. She shows how, at each stage of her upbringing, a girl is conditioned into accepting passivity, dependence, repetition, and inwardness. Every force in society conspires to deprive her of subjectivity and flatten her into an object. Denied the possibility of independent work or creative fulfillment, the woman must accept a dissatisfying life of housework, childbearing, and sexual slavishness.
Having brought the woman to adulthood, de Beauvoir analyzes the various “situations,” or roles, the adult woman inhabits. The bourgeois woman performs three major functions: wife, mother, and entertainer. No matter how illustrious the woman’s household may be, these roles inevitably lead to immanence, incompleteness, and profound frustration. Even those who accept a less conventional place in society—as a prostitute or courtesan, for example—must submit to imperatives defined by the male. De Beauvoir also reflects on the trauma of old age. When a woman loses her reproductive capacity, she loses her primary purpose and therefore her identity. In the final chapter of this section, “Woman’s Situation and Character,” de Beauvoir reiterates the controversial claim that woman’s situation is not a result of her character. Rather, her character is a result of her situation. Her mediocrity, complacency, lack of accomplishment, laziness, passivity—all these qualities are the consequences of her subordination, not the cause.
In “Justifications,” de Beauvoir studies some of the ways that women reinforce their own dependency. Narcissists, women in love, and mystics all embrace their immanence by drowning selfhood in an external object—whether it be the mirror, a lover, or God. Throughout the book, de Beauvoir mentions such instances of females being complicit in their Otherness, particularly with regard to marriage. The difficulty of breaking free from “femininity”—of sacrificing security and comfort for some ill-conceived notion of “equality”—induces many women to accept the usual unfulfilling roles of wife and mother. From the very beginning of her discussion, de Beauvoir identifies the economic underpinnings of female subordination—and the economic roots of woman’s liberation. Only in work can she achieve autonomy. If woman can support herself, she can also achieve a form of liberation. In the concluding chapters of The Second Sex, de Beauvoir discusses the logistical hurdles woman faces in pursuing this goal."
Cultural,"In Outliers: The Story of Success, Malcolm Gladwell considers the circumstances that lead to success. The first half of the book looks closely at how opportunities matter more in the lives of successful people than hard work or raw talent. The second half of the book focuses on cultural legacies: behavioral tendencies rooted in their ancestral past.
Part One examines the role of opportunity in the lives of extremely successful people. Gladwell’s first example is the Canadian Hockey League, the world’s most competitive youth hockey league. Since the cutoff date for the Canadian leagues that serve the youngest players is January 1, those born in the first part of the calendar year are much larger and more coordinated than their peers. The larger and more coordinated kids are given more playing time and better coaching, and thus become better players by the time they reach the top league. An overwhelming majority of Canadian professional hockey players have birthdays in January, February or March.
Gladwell proposes that 10,000 hours of practice is needed to master a skill, even for prodigies like Mozart. Bill Joy, Bill Gates, and the Beatles all worked hard to achieve success but benefited from opportunities they did not create. Joy, one of the founders of Sun Microsystems, happened to attend one of the first colleges in the world with a time-sharing terminal. In graduate school, he had a terminal in his room, where he spent all of his free time programming. Gates happened to attend a private high school with a time-sharing terminal connected to a mainframe in Seattle. He also was able to spend all of his free time programming. Early on, the Beatles were hired to play long shows day after day in Hamburg, Germany. 
Birth year or era is another form of opportunity. Gates and Joy (as well as other early programmers) all reached the end of their teen years just as personal computers became available to the public. In another example, fourteen of the top seventy-five richest people in the history of the world happened to be alive at the same time, in the same country: the United States in the mid-1800s.
Opportunity matters more than an individual’s IQ. Using a study conducted by Lewis Terman, the creator of the Stanford-Binet IQ test, Gladwell shows that “practical intelligence” is as important as “analytical intelligence.” He also contrasts Chris Langan, one of the world’s smartest living people, with Robert Oppenheimer. While both had difficulties in college, only Oppenheimer had a successful life, due to his practical intelligence.
The last portion of Part One looks at Joe Flom, a successful lawyer from New York City. While he was born into a poor family to Jewish immigrants (in a time when Jewish immigrants were not treated well), many of the disadvantages in his life were actually benefits and directly contributed to his success.
Part Two investigates cultural legacies. Using flight recorder transcripts from several plane crashes from the last few decades, Gladwell shows that cultural expectations and habits can be a severe hindrance to pilots. Copilots from countries that have a high “Power Distance Index” (those that show the most deference to authority) will often avoid telling pilots that they are making mistakes, even when the mistakes are potentially fatal. After recognizing the dangers of such cultural expectations, commercial aviation has instituted programs to change the way flight crews talk with one another. 
Gladwell next analyzes the disparity in public school math test scores between Eastern and Western countries. He suggests that the cultures in which rice paddy farming is historically important have a stronger work ethic. Using various examples, Gladwell shows that hard work has a greater impact on success in learning mathematics than intelligence. 
The final example is an examination of the KIPP school in the South Bronx and the “achievement gap” between socioeconomic groups. American students from middle-class and affluent households retain more information over summer vacation and are more likely to make additional gains than students from low-income households. The KIPP school uses longer school days and summer programming to eliminate the achievement gap for low-income children. While the work schedule is very rigorous, the school’s students go on to great academic success.
Gladwell demonstrates that if more opportunities were available, there would be far more successful people and the world would be richer for it."
Day,"Tommy Wilhelm is a man in his mid-forties, temporarily living in the Hotel Gloriana on the Upper West Side of New York City, the same hotel in which his father has taken residence for a number of years. He is out of place from the beginning, living in a hotel filled with elderly retirees and continuing throughout the novel to be a figure of isolation amidst crowds. The novella traverses one very important day in the life of this self-same Tommy Wilhelm: his ""day of reckoning,"" so to speak.
As the novella opens, Tommy is descending in the hotel elevator, on his way to meet his father for breakfast, as he does every morning. However, this morning feels different to Tommy, he feels a certain degree of fear and of foreboding for something that lies in the hours ahead of him and has been building for quite some time.
The reader begins to discover through Tommy's thoughts and through a series of flashbacks that Tommy has just recently been fired from his job as a salesman, he is a college drop-out, a man with two children, recently separated from his wife, and he is a man on the brink of financial disaster. Tommy has just given over the last of his savings to the fraudulent Dr. Tamkin, who has promised to knowingly invest it in the commodities market. Amid all of this, he has, apparently, fallen in love with a woman named Olive, who he cannot marry because his wife will not grant him a divorce. Tommy is unhappy and in need of assistance both emotionally and financially.
In the first three chapters the reader follows Tommy as he talks with his father, Dr. Adler, who sees his son as a failure in every sense of the word. Tommy is refused financial assistance and also refused any kind of support, emotionally or otherwise, from his father. It is also within these beginning chapters that the flashbacks begin. The flashbacks highlight, among other things, Tommy's meeting with the duplicitous Maurice Venice, the talent scout who shows initial interest in a young Tommy and his good looks. Wilhelm, however, is later rejected by the same scout after a failed screen test but nevertheless attempts a career in Hollywood as an actor. He discontinues his college education and moves to California, against his parent's will and warnings.
The chapters that follow focus on Tommy's encounters and conversations with Dr. Tamkin, a seemingly fraudulent and questionable ""psychologist,"" who gives Tommy endless advice and thus provides the assistance he had looked for from his father. Whether Tamkin is fraudulent and questionable as a psychologist, and whether he is a liar and a charlatan is a question that is constantly being posed to us. Regardless, Tamkin is quite charming and appeals to Tommy. Dr. Tamkin claims to be a poet, a healer, a member of the Detroit Purple Gang, as well as claiming a number of other positions and titles. Despite his lies, he gives Tommy kernels of truth that become significant in the novella and for Tommy. Moreover, Tommy entrusts Tamkin with the last of his savings to invest in the commodities market, since Tamkin claims a certain stock market expertise.
The rest of the novella consists of Tommy and Dr. Tamkin traveling back and forth to and from the stock market, meeting several characters along the way. The novel finally illustrates Tommy's terrible loss in the commodities in which Tamkin has invested Tommy's money. Tommy has lost all of his savings but still has the monetary demands of his family to meet. Furthermore, Tamkin has disappeared. After an attempt to look for Tamkin in his room at the hotel, the novella comes to a close with three climaxes—two minor and one large, final climax.
First, there is the final confrontation with his father in the massage room of the hotel in which Tommy is denied any assistance one last time, as he stands before his naked father. Afterward, Tommy has a loud and almost raving fight with his wife on the telephone in which he claims to be ""suffocating"" and unable to ""breathe."" Full of rage, he exits out onto Broadway where he believes to see Dr. Tamkin at a funeral, nearby. He calls out to Tamkin but receives no reply. Suddenly he is swept in by a rush of people and finds himself carried into a crowd within the chapel where the funeral is taking place. It is here that the final climax comes because Tommy finds himself before the body of a dead stranger, unable to break away and he begins to cry and weep. He releases pools of emotion and ""crie[s] with all his heart."" It is here that the book ends. Other people at the funeral are confused as to who he is, wondering how close he had been to the deceased. The deceased is a stranger but Tommy, however, is left in this ""happy oblivion of tears."""
Entirety,"In the midst of a raging war, a plane evacuating a group of schoolboys from Britain is shot down over a deserted tropical island. Two of the boys, Ralph and Piggy, discover a conch shell on the beach, and Piggy realizes it could be used as a horn to summon the other boys. Once assembled, the boys set about electing a leader and devising a way to be rescued. They choose Ralph as their leader, and Ralph appoints another boy, Jack, to be in charge of the boys who will hunt food for the entire group.
Ralph, Jack, and another boy, Simon, set off on an expedition to explore the island. When they return, Ralph declares that they must light a signal fire to attract the attention of passing ships. The boys succeed in igniting some dead wood by focusing sunlight through the lenses of Piggy’s eyeglasses. However, the boys pay more attention to playing than to monitoring the fire, and the flames quickly engulf the forest. A large swath of dead wood burns out of control, and one of the youngest boys in the group disappears, presumably having burned to death.
At first, the boys enjoy their life without grown-ups and spend much of their time splashing in the water and playing games. Ralph, however, complains that they should be maintaining the signal fire and building huts for shelter. The hunters fail in their attempt to catch a wild pig, but their leader, Jack, becomes increasingly preoccupied with the act of hunting.
When a ship passes by on the horizon one day, Ralph and Piggy notice, to their horror, that the signal fire—which had been the hunters’ responsibility to maintain—has burned out. Furious, Ralph accosts Jack, but the hunter has just returned with his first kill, and all the hunters seem gripped with a strange frenzy, reenacting the chase in a kind of wild dance. Piggy criticizes Jack, who hits Piggy across the face. Ralph blows the conch shell and reprimands the boys in a speech intended to restore order. At the meeting, it quickly becomes clear that some of the boys have started to become afraid. The littlest boys, known as “littluns,” have been troubled by nightmares from the beginning, and more and more boys now believe that there is some sort of beast or monster lurking on the island. The older boys try to convince the others at the meeting to think rationally, asking where such a monster could possibly hide during the daytime. One of the littluns suggests that it hides in the sea—a proposition that terrifies the entire group.
Not long after the meeting, some military planes engage in a battle high above the island. The boys, asleep below, do not notice the flashing lights and explosions in the clouds. A parachutist drifts to earth on the signal-fire mountain, dead. Sam and Eric, the twins responsible for watching the fire at night, are asleep and do not see the parachutist land. When the twins wake up, they see the enormous silhouette of his parachute and hear the strange flapping noises it makes. Thinking the island beast is at hand, they rush back to the camp in terror and report that the beast has attacked them.
The boys organize a hunting expedition to search for the monster. Jack and Ralph, who are increasingly at odds, travel up the mountain. They see the silhouette of the parachute from a distance and think that it looks like a huge, deformed ape. The group holds a meeting at which Jack and Ralph tell the others of the sighting. Jack says that Ralph is a coward and that he should be removed from office, but the other boys refuse to vote Ralph out of power. Jack angrily runs away down the beach, calling all the hunters to join him. Ralph rallies the remaining boys to build a new signal fire, this time on the beach rather than on the mountain. They obey, but before they have finished the task, most of them have slipped away to join Jack.
Jack declares himself the leader of the new tribe of hunters and organizes a hunt and a violent, ritual slaughter of a sow to solemnize the occasion. The hunters then decapitate the sow and place its head on a sharpened stake in the jungle as an offering to the beast. Later, encountering the bloody, fly-covered head, Simon has a terrible vision, during which it seems to him that the head is speaking. The voice, which he imagines as belonging to the Lord of the Flies, says that Simon will never escape him, for he exists within all men. Simon faints. When he wakes up, he goes to the mountain, where he sees the dead parachutist. Understanding then that the beast does not exist externally but rather within each individual boy, Simon travels to the beach to tell the others what he has seen. But the others are in the midst of a chaotic revelry—even Ralph and Piggy have joined Jack’s feast—and when they see Simon’s shadowy figure emerge from the jungle, they fall upon him and kill him with their bare hands and teeth.
The following morning, Ralph and Piggy discuss what they have done. Jack’s hunters attack them and their few followers and steal Piggy’s glasses in the process. Ralph’s group travels to Jack’s stronghold in an attempt to make Jack see reason, but Jack orders Sam and Eric tied up and fights with Ralph. In the ensuing battle, one boy, Roger, rolls a boulder down the mountain, killing Piggy and shattering the conch shell. Ralph barely manages to escape a torrent of spears.
Ralph hides for the rest of the night and the following day, while the others hunt him like an animal. Jack has the other boys ignite the forest in order to smoke Ralph out of his hiding place. Ralph stays in the forest, where he discovers and destroys the sow’s head, but eventually, he is forced out onto the beach, where he knows the other boys will soon arrive to kill him. Ralph collapses in exhaustion, but when he looks up, he sees a British naval officer standing over him. The officer’s ship noticed the fire raging in the jungle. The other boys reach the beach and stop in their tracks at the sight of the officer. Amazed at the spectacle of this group of bloodthirsty, savage children, the officer asks Ralph to explain. Ralph is overwhelmed by the knowledge that he is safe but, thinking about what has happened on the island, he begins to weep. The other boys begin to sob as well. The officer turns his back so that the boys may regain their composure."
Drama,"In the Puritan New England town of Salem, Massachusetts, a group of girls goes dancing in the forest with a black slave named Tituba. While dancing, they are caught by the local minister, Reverend Parris. One of the girls, Parris’s daughter Betty, falls into a coma-like state. A crowd gathers in the Parris home while rumors of witchcraft fill the town. Having sent for Reverend Hale, an expert on witchcraft, Parris questions Abigail Williams, the girls’ ringleader, about the events that took place in the forest. Abigail, who is Parris’s niece and ward, admits to doing nothing beyond “dancing.”
While Parris tries to calm the crowd that has gathered in his home, Abigail talks to some of the other girls, telling them not to admit to anything. John Proctor, a local farmer, then enters and talks to Abigail alone. Unbeknownst to anyone else in the town, while working in Proctor’s home the previous year she engaged in an affair with him, which led to her being fired by his wife, Elizabeth. Abigail still desires Proctor, but he fends her off and tells her to end her foolishness with the girls.
Betty wakes up and begins screaming. Much of the crowd rushes upstairs and gathers in her bedroom, arguing over whether she is bewitched. A separate argument between Proctor, Parris, the argumentative Giles Corey, and the wealthy Thomas Putnam soon ensues. This dispute centers on money and land deeds, and it suggests that deep fault lines run through the Salem community. As the men argue, Reverend Hale arrives and examines Betty, while Proctor departs. Hale quizzes Abigail about the girls’ activities in the forest, grows suspicious of her behavior, and demands to speak to Tituba. After Parris and Hale interrogate her for a brief time, Tituba confesses to communing with the devil, and she hysterically accuses various townsfolk of consorting with the devil. Suddenly, Abigail joins her, confessing to having seen the devil conspiring and cavorting with other townspeople. Betty joins them in naming witches, and the crowd is thrown into an uproar.
A week later, alone in their farmhouse outside of town, John and Elizabeth Proctor discuss the ongoing trials and the escalating number of townsfolk who have been accused of being witches. Elizabeth urges her husband to denounce Abigail as a fraud; he refuses, and she becomes jealous, accusing him of still harboring feelings for her. Mary Warren, their servant and one of Abigail’s circle, returns from Salem with news that Elizabeth has been accused of witchcraft but the court did not pursue the accusation. Mary is sent up to bed, and John and Elizabeth continue their argument, only to be interrupted by a visit from Reverend Hale. While they discuss matters, Giles Corey and Francis Nurse come to the Proctor home with news that their wives have been arrested. Officers of the court suddenly arrive and arrest Elizabeth. After they have taken her, Proctor browbeats Mary, insisting that she must go to Salem and expose Abigail and the other girls as frauds.
The next day, Proctor brings Mary to court and tells Judge Danforth that she will testify that the girls are lying. Danforth is suspicious of Proctor’s motives and tells Proctor, truthfully, that Elizabeth is pregnant and will be spared for a time. Proctor persists in his charge, convincing Danforth to allow Mary to testify. Mary tells the court that the girls are lying. When the girls are brought in, they turn the tables by accusing Mary of bewitching them. Furious, Proctor confesses his affair with Abigail and accuses her of being motivated by jealousy of his wife. To test Proctor’s claim, Danforth summons Elizabeth and asks her if Proctor has been unfaithful to her. Despite her natural honesty, she lies to protect Proctor’s honor, and Danforth denounces Proctor as a liar. Meanwhile, Abigail and the girls again pretend that Mary is bewitching them, and Mary breaks down and accuses Proctor of being a witch. Proctor rages against her and against the court. He is arrested, and Hale quits the proceedings.
The summer passes and autumn arrives. The witch trials have caused unrest in neighboring towns, and Danforth grows nervous. Abigail has run away, taking all of Parris’s money with her. Hale, who has lost faith in the court, begs the accused witches to confess falsely in order to save their lives, but they refuse. Danforth, however, has an idea: he asks Elizabeth to talk John into confessing, and she agrees. Conflicted, but desiring to live, John agrees to confess, and the officers of the court rejoice. But he refuses to incriminate anyone else, and when the court insists that the confession must be made public, Proctor grows angry, tears it up, and retracts his admission of guilt. Despite Hale’s desperate pleas, Proctor goes to the gallows with the others, and the witch trials reach their awful conclusion."
Begun,"Guy Montag is a fireman who burns books in a futuristic American city. In Montag’s world, firemen start fires rather than putting them out. The people in this society do not read books, enjoy nature, spend time by themselves, think independently, or have meaningful conversations. Instead, they drive very fast, watch excessive amounts of television on wall-size sets, and listen to the radio on “Seashell Radio” sets attached to their ears.
Montag encounters a gentle seventeen-year-old girl named Clarisse McClellan, who opens his eyes to the emptiness of his life with her innocently penetrating questions and her unusual love of people and nature. Over the next few days, Montag experiences a series of disturbing events. First, his wife, Mildred, attempts suicide by swallowing a bottle of sleeping pills. Then, when he responds to an alarm that an old woman has a stash of hidden literature, the woman shocks him by choosing to be burned alive along with her books. A few days later, he hears that Clarisse has been killed by a speeding car. Montag’s dissatisfaction with his life increases, and he begins to search for a solution in a stash of books that he has stolen from his own fires and hidden inside an air-conditioning vent.
When Montag fails to show up for work, his fire chief, Beatty, pays a visit to his house. Beatty explains that it’s normal for a fireman to go through a phase of wondering what books have to offer, and he delivers a dizzying monologue explaining how books came to be banned in the first place. According to Beatty, special-interest groups and other “minorities” objected to books that offended them. Soon, books all began to look the same, as writers tried to avoid offending anybody. This was not enough, however, and society as a whole decided to simply burn books rather than permit conflicting opinions. Beatty tells Montag to take twenty-four hours or so to see if his stolen books contain anything worthwhile and then turn them in for incineration. Montag begins a long and frenzied night of reading.
Overwhelmed by the task of reading, Montag looks to his wife for help and support, but she prefers television to her husband’s company and cannot understand why he would want to take the terrible risk of reading books. He remembers that he once met a retired English professor named Faber sitting in a park, and he decides that this man might be able to help him understand what he reads. He visits Faber, who tells him that the value of books lies in the detailed awareness of life that they contain. Faber says that Montag needs not only books but also the leisure to read them and the freedom to act upon their ideas.
Faber agrees to help Montag with his reading, and they concoct a risky scheme to overthrow the status quo. Faber will contact a printer and begin reproducing books, and Montag will plant books in the homes of firemen to discredit the profession and to destroy the machinery of censorship. Faber gives him a two-way radio earpiece (the “green bullet”) so that he can hear what Montag hears and talk to him secretly.
Montag goes home, and soon two of his wife’s friends arrive to watch television. The women discuss their families and the war that is about to be declared in an extremely frivolous manner. Their superficiality angers him, and he takes out a book of poetry and reads “Dover Beach” by Matthew Arnold. Faber buzzes in his ear for him to be quiet, and Mildred tries to explain that the poetry reading is a standard way for firemen to demonstrate the uselessness of literature. The women are extremely disturbed by the poem and leave to file a complaint against Montag.
Montag goes to the fire station and hands over one of his books to Beatty. Beatty confuses Montag by barraging him with contradictory quotations from great books. Beatty exploits these contradictions to show that literature is morbid and dangerously complex, and that it deserves incineration. Suddenly, the alarm sounds, and they rush off to answer the call, only to find that the alarm is at Montag’s own house. Mildred gets into a cab with her suitcase, and Montag realizes that his own wife has betrayed him.
Beatty forces Montag to burn the house himself; when he is done, Beatty places him under arrest. When Beatty continues to berate Montag, Montag turns the flamethrower on his superior and proceeds to burn him to ashes. Montag knocks the other firemen unconscious and runs. The Mechanical Hound, a monstrous machine that Beatty has set to attack Montag, pounces and injects Montag’s leg with a large dose of anesthetic. Montag manages to destroy it with his flamethrower; then he walks off the numbness in his leg and escapes with some books that were hidden in his backyard. He hides these in another fireman’s house and calls in an alarm from a pay phone.
Montag goes to Faber’s house, where he learns that a new Hound has been put on his trail, along with several helicopters and a television crew. Faber tells Montag that he is leaving for St. Louis to see a retired printer who may be able to help them. Montag gives Faber some money and tells him how to remove Montag’s scent from his house so the Hound will not enter it. Montag then takes some of Faber’s old clothes and runs off toward the river. The whole city watches as the chase unfolds on TV, but Montag manages to escape in the river and change into Faber’s clothes to disguise his scent. He drifts downstream into the country and follows a set of abandoned railroad tracks until he finds a group of renegade intellectuals (“the Book People”), led by a man named Granger, who welcome him. They are a part of a nationwide network of book lovers who have memorized many great works of literature and philosophy. They hope that they may be of some help to mankind in the aftermath of the war that has just been declared. Montag’s role is to memorize the Book of Ecclesiastes. Enemy jets appear in the sky and completely obliterate the city with bombs. Montag and his new friends move on to search for survivors and rebuild civilization."

After Olly gets over his misgivings, he and Maddy fly to Hawaii. They spend a wonderful, intimate day together, but in the middle of the night, Maddy wakes up with aches and fever chills. Olly calls an ambulance to take her to the hospital. Meanwhile, Maddy’s mother has learned where they were and has boarded a flight to Hawaii. When she arrives, she puts Maddy on a plane back home.
Maddy and her mother try to resume life as before. Maddy misses Olly but believes she must shut her heart to the possibility of love. She deletes all of Olly’s emails, unread. Her mother, seeing how sad Maddy is, rehires Carla. Olly and his mother and sister move out of their house, leaving his father behind, alone.
Maddy receives an email from the doctor who treated her in Hawaii. The doctor questions whether Maddy has SCID and urges her to consult a doctor other than her mother. Confronted, Maddy’s mother insists that Maddy really is sick. Searching her mother’s office at night, however, Maddy finds no record of a SCID diagnosis, nor any records of the years of treatment. A specialist contacted by Carla confirms: Maddy does not have SCID. The shock and grief Maddy’s mother felt over losing her husband and son expressed itself as a pathological need to protect Maddy from all possibility of harm.
Maddy is angry at her mother and wants to leave home, but Carla counsels her to be more compassionate. Maddy books a flight to New York. During the flight, she begins to forgive her mother. In New York, she and Olly happily reunite."
Gains,"Michelle Obama grows up in a two-story bungalow on Chicago’s South Side. Her parents, Fraser and Marian Robinson, rent an upstairs apartment from Marian’s aunt and uncle, who live downstairs. Michelle’s father has multiple sclerosis, but he does not let his disability limit him. He works at a water filtration plant and is also a local precinct captain for the Democratic party. Michelle is a smart, determined girl with little tolerance for disorder. She is less sociable than her older brother, Craig, a gifted basketball player who has many friends. Over time, however, Michelle learns to be more outgoing.
Michelle’s parents believe in education. Her mother does volunteer work on behalf of their neighborhood school, which struggles to maintain quality as the neighborhood declines. Fraser and Marian send Craig to a predominantly white Catholic school with a strong basketball program and a rigorous curriculum. When Michelle is ready for high school, she gains admission to Whitney Young, a new magnet school for gifted students. At Whitney Young, her friendship with a daughter of civil rights leader the Reverend Jesse Jackson gives Michelle a chance to observe what life is like for people active in politics.
Michelle follows her brother to Princeton, where she does well. One of her closest friends at Princeton is a Jamaican student named Suzanne; that friendship helps Michelle see that not everyone has to be as organized and driven as she is. Michelle graduates, studies law at Harvard, and goes to work at a high-end law firm in Chicago. By then, however, she realizes that she hates being a lawyer. Her life takes a turn when she is asked to help mentor a male summer associate named Barack Obama. The son of a Black Kenyan father and a white American mother, he is older than Michelle but started law school later, after some years doing other things, including community organizing in Chicago. Barack’s brilliance is quickly apparent to everyone at the firm, and he and Michelle are immediately attracted to each other.
As Michelle and Barack get acquainted, she sees that he has a higher tolerance for turmoil and uncertainty than she does. She also sees his dedication to making the world a better place. However, Michelle faces crushing loss: her friend Suzanne dies of cancer, and her father dies from MS after decades of fighting to live a normal life. Realizing that life is short, Michelle looks for opportunities to transition out of her legal career. Some personal connections lead to a job at city hall, working for Valerie Jarrett, who will become a lifelong friend and ally. Barack, meanwhile, works in the Chicago area for a national get-out-the vote organization. By now, he and Michelle are engaged. They marry in 1992.
Barack is working for a public interest law firm when the opportunity arises for him to run for a seat in the Illinois state senate. By now, Michelle has run a nonprofit organization and is serving as a university dean. Michelle does not like politics and predicts that Barack will not like it, either; but after he wins his race, he turns out to have the right kind of temperament and skills to be a politician. Then Barack loses his mother to cancer, and Michelle suffers a miscarriage. After failed attempts to conceive again, the Obamas turn to in vitro fertilization (IVF) and their first daughter, Malia, is born Michelle becomes director of community outreach at a hospital. 
After a failed campaign for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, daughter Sasha is born. Their burgeoning family and careers but strains on Michelle and Barack, but couples therapy helps them make some useful adjustments. Barack runs for the U.S. Senate and unexpectedly builds a commanding lead even before his speech at the Democratic National Convention boosts his national profile. He wins the Senate race easily.
When Barack moves to Washington, Michelle and the girls stay in Chicago. To her consternation, Barack and a team of advisers are already discussing a 2008 presidential run. She agrees to be part of the campaign but privately thinks that as a Black man, Barack cannot win. During the campaign, there are absurd rumors, circulated by his opponents, about Barack having Muslim ties. Michelle is an asset on the campaign trail, although she is discouraged when a video of one of her speeches is edited down to suggests that she carries a grudge against America. After the August convention, where Michelle gives a well-received speech, Barack and his running mate, Joe Biden, achieve a decisive win. Michelle believes that Barack is the right person to lead the country out of the ongoing economic recession.
The transition between the Bush and Obama administrations is smooth and welcoming. The White House staff is kind and efficient. Michelle and Barack learn to get used to being accompanied by Secret Service agents whenever they go out, but they do their best to keep the girls’ lives as normal as possible. Michelle’s mother, whom Barack and Michelle persuaded to move in with them, declines Secret Service protection altogether.
As First Lady, Michelle must be engaged and productive without overstepping her bounds. Her early work focuses on childhood obesity, through the Let’s Move! initiative to promote exercise and healthy eating. Michelle plants a vegetable garden on the South Lawn. She also promotes post-high school education through her Reach Higher initiative, and education for girls around the world through the Let Girls Learn initiative. Finally, she teams up with the Second Lady, Jill Biden, to improve support for military families through the Joining Forces initiative. 
During Barack’s successful reelection campaign in 2012, Michelle discovers the power of social media. Like the rest of the country, the Obamas are shocked by mass shootings at Sandy Hook School in Newtown, Connecticut and at a Black church in Charleston. The death of a Chicago girl in a drive-by shooting has personal meaning for Michelle: the girl lived not far from Michelle’s old neighborhood and had recently participated in the second inaugural celebration. 
During the 2016 presidential contest, Michelle is appalled by Donald Trump’s past and present behavior and is shocked when he achieves a come-from-behind win over Hillary Clinton. She takes comfort in all the things she and Barack have accomplished over the last eight years and reminds herself that there is much to be optimistic about."
Devotion,"Margery Kempe is a well-off middle-class townswoman in the medieval English town of King’s Lynn. After the birth of her first child, Margery has a nervous breakdown, seeing hideous devils all around her. Margery recovers after having a vision of Jesus Christ, and she decides to devote her life to holiness and contemplation of God. One of the first hurdles Margery has to overcome is convincing her husband to live a life of celibacy with her—she succeeds only after having fourteen children. After the failure of a brewing business she starts, Margery becomes certain that God wants her to turn away from the world. Margery’s devotion to Jesus is highly emotional and dramatic, and she soon acquires a reputation as a religious eccentric, a potentially dangerous reputation in a time when heresy was a capital offense. Margery faces doubt and temptation, especially sexual temptation, but she perseveres and often receives guidance in her visions.
Margery makes several pilgrimages, the longest and most difficult of which is a journey to Jerusalem, with a long stopover in Rome. During the pilgrimage, Margery is shunned by her fellow travelers but is often accepted by the poor, a pattern that repeats itself throughout her life. In Jerusalem, Margery has several intense visions, and she begins to have spells in which she sobs and cries uncontrollably. These crying fits come upon her most often during religious services, but they also occur whenever she simply thinks of Jesus or sees something that reminds her of his suffering. Margery is stranded in Rome for a time after giving away her money to the poor, and she makes her way by begging. Margery’s extreme behavior begins to make her notorious, and she makes enemies among the English contingent in Rome. Eventually, Margery is given enough money to return home.
Upon her return to England, Margery does her best to live a life of devotion to Christ. As a married woman, however, she is somewhat constrained, such as by the fact that she cannot become a nun. Margery travels to various churches and holy sites in England, attracting attention wherever she goes, thanks to her public weeping and her all-white wardrobe. At times, Margery is accepted as a holy woman, and her advice and blessings are solicited. More often, she is treated as an oddity or a nuisance and mocked. On occasion, the hostile attention she draws goes beyond mockery. Traveling through the north of England, Margery is arrested several times and almost burned at the stake as a heretic, though she is saved by the intervention of the church authorities. Each time she is arrested, Margery defends herself vigorously. She is respectful to authority but firm in her beliefs, none of which are heretical, as her examiners soon see.
Margery continues to have mystical visions of Jesus, the Virgin Mary, and several saints. Margery’s devotion to Christ is particularly intense and is expressed in highly physical, even sexual, terms. In her visions, Margery often sees herself as a servant to Mary or Jesus, acting as an eyewitness to the events of the gospels. Jesus speaks to Margery in her visions of such subjects as the Trinity, the salvation and damnation of souls, and the meaning of the constant tears he sends her. Margery tries to spend as much time as she can in prayer or in conversation with her spiritual guides. Even so, her dramatic weeping in church and elsewhere continues to draw attention and, often, censure. Margery comes into particular conflict with a friar who moves to Lynn and refuses to allow Margery to hear him preach because of her disruptive weeping.
As time goes on, Margery’s husband becomes old and infirm, and Margery returns to his household to care for him. One of Margery’s sons turns from his sinful ways after much praying and beseeching by Margery, and he marries a German woman. The couple comes to England for a visit, and the son takes ill and dies, soon followed by his father. In her last extended journey, Margery accompanies her daughter-in-law (who is less than enthusiastic about being joined by her odd mother-in-law) back to Germany, only deciding to leave at the last minute. Margery’s trip overland from Germany to France is her most grueling yet, and she is again scorned by other travelers from England, to whom she turns for help. Eventually, Margery makes it to London and finally back to Lynn. Home once again, Margery, now an old woman, decides to record the story of her life and her devotions, and begins the dictation of her Book."
Went,"It is the spring of 1861. Scarlett O’Hara, a pretty Southern belle, lives on Tara, a large plantation in Georgia. She concerns herself only with her numerous suitors and her desire to marry Ashley Wilkes. One day she hears that Ashley is engaged to Melanie Hamilton, his frail, plain cousin from Atlanta. At a barbecue at the Wilkes plantation the next day, Scarlett confesses her feelings to Ashley. He tells her that he does love her but that he is marrying Melanie because she is similar to him, whereas he and Scarlett are very different. Scarlett slaps Ashley and he leaves the room. Suddenly Scarlett realizes that she is not alone. Rhett Butler, a scandalous but dashing adventurer, has been watching the whole scene, and he compliments Scarlett on being unladylike. 
The Civil War begins. Charles Hamilton, Melanie’s timid, dull brother, proposes to Scarlett. She spitefully agrees to marry him, hoping to hurt Ashley. Over the course of two months, Scarlett and Charles marry, Charles joins the army and dies of the measles, and Scarlett learns that she is pregnant. After Scarlett gives birth to a son, Wade, she becomes bored and unhappy. She makes a long trip to Atlanta to stay with Melanie and Melanie’s aunt, Pittypat. The busy city agrees with Scarlett’s temperament, and she begins to see a great deal of Rhett. Rhett infuriates Scarlett with his bluntness and mockery, but he also encourages her to flout the severely restrictive social requirements for mourning Southern widows. As the war progresses, food and clothing run scarce in Atlanta. Scarlett and Melanie fear for Ashley’s safety. After the bloody battle of Gettysburg, Ashley is captured and sent to prison, and the Yankee army begins bearing down on Atlanta. Scarlett desperately wants to return home to Tara, but she has promised Ashley she will stay with the pregnant Melanie, who could give birth at any time.
	On the night the Yankees capture Atlanta and set it afire, Melanie gives birth to her son, Beau. Rhett helps Scarlett and Melanie escape the Yankees, escorting them through the burning streets of the city, but he abandons them outside Atlanta so he can join the Confederate Army. Scarlett drives the cart all night and day through a dangerous forest full of deserters and soldiers, at last reaching Tara. She arrives to find that her mother, Ellen, is dead; her father, Gerald, has lost his mind; and the Yankee army has looted the plantation, leaving no food or cotton. Scavenging for subsistence, a furious Scarlett vows never to go hungry again.
	Scarlett takes charge of rebuilding Tara. She murders a Yankee thief and puts out a fire set by a spiteful Yankee soldier. At last the war ends, word comes that Ashley is free and on his way home, and a stream of returning soldiers begins pouring through Tara. One such soldier, a one-legged homeless Confederate named Will Benteen, stays on and helps Scarlett with the plantation. One day, Will brings terrible news: Jonas Wilkerson, a former employee at Tara and current government official, has raised the taxes on Tara, hoping to drive the O’Haras out so that he might buy the plantation. Distraught, Scarlett hurries to Atlanta to seduce Rhett Butler so that he will give her the three hundred dollars she needs for taxes. Rhett has emerged from the war a fabulously wealthy man, dripping with earnings from his blockade-running operation and from food speculation. However, Rhett is in a Yankee jail and cannot help Scarlett. Scarlett sees her sister’s beau, Frank Kennedy, who now owns a general store, and forges a plan. Determined to save Tara, she betrays her sister and marries Frank, pays the taxes on Tara, and devotes herself to making Frank’s business more profitable.
	After Rhett blackmails his way out of prison, he lends Scarlett enough money to buy a sawmill. To the displeasure of Atlanta society, Scarlett becomes a shrewd businesswoman. Gerald dies, and Scarlett returns to Tara for the funeral. There, she persuades Ashley and Melanie to move to Atlanta and accept a share in her lumber business. Shortly thereafter, Scarlett gives birth to Frank’s child, Ella Lorena.
	A free black man and his white male companion attack Scarlett on her way home from the sawmill one day. That night, the Ku Klux Klan avenges the attack on Scarlett, and Frank ends up dead. Rhett proposes to Scarlett and she quickly accepts. After a long, luxurious honeymoon in New Orleans, Scarlett and Rhett return to Atlanta, where Scarlett builds a garish mansion and socializes with wealthy Yankees. Scarlett becomes pregnant again and has another child, Bonnie Blue Butler. Rhett dotes on the girl and begins a successful campaign to win back the good graces of the prominent Atlanta citizens in order to keep Bonnie from being an outcast like Scarlett.
	Scarlett and Rhett’s marriage begins happily, but Rhett becomes increasingly bitter and indifferent toward her. Scarlett’s feelings for Ashley have diminished into a warm, sympathetic friendship, but Ashley’s jealous sister, India, finds them in a friendly embrace and spreads the rumor that they are having an affair. To Scarlett’s surprise, Melanie takes Scarlett’s side and refuses to believe the rumors.
	After Bonnie is killed in a horse-riding accident, Rhett nearly loses his mind, and his marriage with Scarlett worsens. Not long after the funeral, Melanie has a miscarriage and falls very ill. Distraught, Scarlett hurries to see her. Melanie makes Scarlett promise to look after Ashley and Beau. Scarlett realizes that she loves and depends on Melanie and that Ashley has been only a fantasy for her. She concludes that she truly loves Rhett. After Melanie dies, Scarlett hurries to tell Rhett of her revelation. Rhett, however, says that he has lost his love for Scarlett, and he leaves her. Grief-stricken and alone, Scarlett makes up her mind to go back to Tara to recover her strength in the comforting arms of her childhood nurse and slave, Mammy, and to think of a way to win Rhett back."
Allocating,"Charlie, the fifteen-year-old narrator of The Perks of Being a Wallflower, has just entered his freshman year of high school when the book begins. Charlie is the eponymous “wallflower.” He is quiet and withdrawn, but he is also extremely observant and thoughtful, always paying close attention to everything going on around him, even if he is only a silent witness. Charlie writes the entire book as a series of letters to an anonymous “friend.” The reader never learns who this “friend” is, and the “friend” never writes back. Each letter begins with the greeting “Dear friend” and ends “Love always, Charlie.” Because the recipient of the letters never writes back, the novel reads like a series of diary entries.
When the novel opens, Charlie is grappling with two major traumatic deaths of loved ones in his past. The most recent death occurred last spring, when his only friend from middle school committed suicide. When Charlie was seven, his beloved Aunt Helen was killed in a car crash on Christmas Eve, which is also Charlie’s birthday. Although Charlie is nervous about entering high school, he soon finds acceptance from two main sources. First, his English teacher, Bill Anderson, recognizes Charlie’s talent for literature, and he takes him under his wing, assigning him extra books to read and essays to write over the course of the year. Also, Charlie begins to participate more in events, and he becomes friends with Patrick and his stepsister, Sam, who integrate him into their friend group. Charlie develops an enormous crush on Sam, which he tells her about, but Sam treats him affectionately. Patrick, who is gay, is having a closeted relationship with Brad, the quarterback of the football team. Sam kisses Charlie so that his first kiss can be from someone who loves him.
As the school year progresses, Charlie begins to come out of his shell somewhat, but Charlie’s life, his family life, and his friends’ lives become more and more complicated. The holidays are always a difficult time for Charlie’s family, because they bring up memories of Aunt Helen’s death. This year is no exception. Even though Charlie finds some solace in reading and re-reading The Catcher in the Rye, he still struggles to cope with his depression and with flashbacks of his time with Aunt Helen. However, Charlie’s acceptance by his friend group helps him become more at peace with himself. As Charlie becomes more mature, his relationship with his sister also deepens. Charlie’s sister has an abusive boyfriend. Charlie tells Bill about the boyfriend, and Bill reports it to their parents, which makes his sister mad at Charlie. But when Charlie’s sister becomes pregnant, she decides to have an abortion, she trusts Charlie to drive her to the clinic.
After Charlie performs as Rocky in one of his friend group’s regular viewings of the film The Rocky Horror Picture Show, Mary Elizabeth, a smart, pretty senior in their friend group, starts dating Charlie. However, Mary Elizabeth is far more interested in Mary Elizabeth than in having a relationship. During a game of Truth or Dare, Charlie is dared to kiss the prettiest girl in the room, and he kisses Sam. Mary Elizabeth stalks out of the room in a rage. In solidarity, the rest of the group sides with Mary Elizabeth, and Patrick advises Charlie to stay away from everyone for a while until tempers cool down.
Brad’s abusive father discovers Patrick and Brad’s relationship, and Brad is sent to rehab. When Brad returns, he refuses to speak to Patrick. Patrick confronts Brad in the cafeteria, Brad makes a derogatory comment about Patrick’s homosexuality, and Brad’s football teammates beat up Patrick. Charlie jumps in and, in a whirlwind, breaks up the fight. His defense of Patrick wins back the respect of Sam and his friend group. Patrick is thoroughly depressed and he leans on Charlie for emotional support. Patrick gets drunk and kisses Charlie, but he apologizes, and Charlie understands that Patrick is lonely and doesn’t know how to handle it. Eventually, Patrick sees Brad kissing a strange man in the park, which helps Patrick pull himself together and move on.
At the end of the school year, Charlie becomes increasingly anxious as the prospect of all his senior friends moving away becomes more and more imminent. When Sam is packing to leave for her summer pre-college program, she and Charlie begin to make out and start to have sexual contact, but Charlie suddenly gets extremely uncomfortable. The sexual contact dredges up a repressed memory of his Aunt Helen molesting him as a child.
In an epilogue, Charlie writes a final letter to his “friend,” dated two months later, saying that his parents had found him naked in a catatonic state on the couch. They took him to a mental hospital, where Charlie eventually realizes that Aunt Helen had sexually abused him, but that he had repressed these memories. Charlie forgives the memory of his Aunt Helen, and the novel ends with Charlie writing that he is planning to stop writing letters and to start participating fully in his life."
Goes,"Never Let Me Go takes place in a dystopian version of late 1990s England, where the lives of ordinary citizens are prolonged through a state-sanctioned program of human cloning. The clones, referred to as students, grow up in special institutions away from the outside world. As young adults, they begin to donate their vital organs. All “donors” receive care from designated “carers,” clones who have not yet begun the donation process. The clones continue to donate organs until they “complete,” which is a euphemism for death after the donation of three or four organs. However, this premise is not immediately apparent to the reader. At the start of the novel, narrator Kathy H. merely introduces herself as a thirty-one-year-old carer. She has been a carer for nearly twelve years, but will leave her role in a few months. Kathy explains that she wants to revisit her memories of Tommy and Ruth, two friends who grew up with her at the Hailsham school. Kathy does not explain the donation program, or mention that Hailsham students are clones.
Although Kathy’s narration is often nonlinear, the novel’s three parts roughly align with three stages in her life. In Part One, Kathy remembers her childhood at Hailsham. She describes her friendship with Ruth, whose temperamental personality contrasts with her own quiet demeanor. At Hailsham, Ruth often annoys Kathy by pretending to have special knowledge and privileges. Kathy also describes Tommy, a student known for throwing violent temper tantrums. Tommy is initially an outcast among his peers because he lacks artistic ability, which the Hailsham staff (part teacher, part parent figures known as “guardians”), and its students value highly. Kathy sympathizes with Tommy, and tries to calm him down during one of his tantrums. Tommy later learns to control his temper after a guardian named Miss Lucy assures him that it is not necessary for him to be creative.
Although the students learn vaguely about the donation program, their guardians shield them from a full understanding of their future. Miss Lucy disagrees with this indirect approach, and often exhibits strange behavior in front of the students as a result, in one instance telling them explicitly about their futures. After Miss Lucy speaks with Tommy about his artwork, he and Kathy theorize that creativity may be connected to donations. They speculate about Madame, a woman who visits Hailsham to collect the best student artwork. Madame is rumored to keep this art in a personal gallery. Kathy later encounters Madame in the girls’ dormitory, while Kathy dances to the song “Never Let Me Go.” The song is Kathy’s favorite track on Songs After Dark, a Judy Bridgewater album that is one of her most prized possessions. When the song ends, Kathy sees Madame crying in the doorway. Shortly afterwards, Kathy loses her tape. Tommy’s temper returns during their last summer at Hailsham. Kathy thinks he is upset about his recent breakup with Ruth, whom he has dated for six months. But Tommy is upset about Miss Lucy, who recently told him that she was wrong to dismiss the importance of creativity. Miss Lucy departs Hailsham abruptly, and Tommy mends his relationship with Ruth.
In Part Two, Kathy moves with Ruth and Tommy to a transitional housing facility known as the Cottages. They adjust to their new lives, becoming acquainted with the “veteran” students living there already. Ruth often ignores Tommy and Kathy in her efforts to blend in with the veterans, who are not from Hailsham. Kathy notices that the veterans regard the Hailsham students with awe. One couple, Chrissie and Rodney, are especially interested in Hailsham. They convince Ruth to go with them to Norfolk, where Rodney claims to have seen Ruth’s “possible” in an open-plan office (a “possible” is a human that resembles a specific clone and from whom that clone's DNA may have been copied). Kathy is skeptical of Rodney’s story, especially since it features Ruth’s “dream future” of working in an open-plan office. In the end, Kathy, Tommy, Ruth, Rodney, and Chrissie all drive to Norfolk.
In Norfolk, Chrissie and Rodney ask about a rumored exception allowing Hailsham couples in love to defer their donations. Ruth pretends to know something about deferrals, which surprises Kathy and Tommy. The students eventually find the open-plan office. Rodney points to a woman in the window, and they all agree that she could be Ruth’s legitimate possible. They follow her to an art gallery, where they realize that the woman does not actually resemble Ruth. In her disappointment, Ruth says that the students are modeled only on “trash.” Ruth goes off with Chrissie and Rodney. Meanwhile, Tommy and Kathy find a copy of Kathy’s lost tape in a secondhand store. Tommy tells Kathy that he has begun drawing pictures of imaginary animals. He thinks Madame uses the students’ artwork to determine if couples applying for deferrals are truly in love. After Norfolk, Ruth stops talking about her dream future. Tommy shows his drawings to Kathy, who finds them puzzling but captivating. Meanwhile, Kathy’s friendship with Ruth grows increasingly tense. Ruth reveals that she knows Kathy likes Tommy, but says that Tommy will never return Kathy’s feelings. Shortly afterwards, Kathy submits her application for carer training and departs.
Part Three focuses on Kathy’s time as carer. While Kathy is good at her job, the work is both difficult and lonely. She unexpectedly runs into a Hailsham friend named Laura, who is also a carer. They talk about Ruth, who had a bad first donation. They also talk about Hailsham, which has closed. Kathy becomes Ruth’s carer, but their relationship is strained and guarded. One day, Ruth expresses a desire to visit a beached fishing boat near Tommy’s recovery center. They pick up Tommy on the way to the boat, which they find bleached and crumbling in a marsh. The marsh reminds both Tommy and Ruth of Hailsham. They also discuss Chrissie, who completed on her second donation. On the return trip, Ruth apologizes for keeping Tommy and Kathy apart. She encourages them to pursue a deferral, revealing that she has discovered Madame’s home address. In the weeks that follow, Kathy and Ruth reminisce peacefully about Hailsham and the Cottages. Ruth also encourages Kathy to become Tommy’s carer.
Ruth completes after her second donation. Tommy gives his third donation, and Kathy becomes his carer. They spend their days reading and talking at his recovery center. Eventually, they also begin to have sex. Hoping to pursue a deferral, they go to visit Madame at the address Ruth provided. Madame invites them inside and listens to their request, after which Miss Emily appears from the next room. Miss Emily says that deferrals do not exist. She explains that Hailsham was part of a progressive movement committed to raising clones more humanely. Madame used to exhibit the students’ artwork to show the outside world that clones had souls. Although the movement once had many supporters, changing public opinion eventually forced Hailsham to close. On the drive back to his recovery center, Tommy asks Kathy to pull over. He walks into the woods and begins screaming. Kathy goes to Tommy and holds him. Soon after, Tommy gives his fourth donation and completes. Kathy drives to a field in Norfolk, where she allows herself to imagine Tommy on the horizon. Then she drives away."
Reborn,"First published in 1982, the graphic novel V for Vendetta depicts a near-future version of a dystopian Britain in the 1990s, following a nuclear war that decimated much of Europe and the world. The racist, homophobic, neo-fascist Norsefire party has restored postwar order, but at a serious human toll: at gruesome Resettlement Camps, the party imprisoned, tortured, and killed all citizens it deems to be undesirable, including gay people, immigrants, racial minorities, socialists, dissidents, Jewish people, and other non-Christians. The authoritarian Norsefire government, led by Leader Adam Susan, allows its surviving citizens very few freedoms, and they also suffer from food shortages and environmental-induced illnesses. Surveillance cameras record people’s every move and word, any form of dissent is quickly suppressed, and state-produced propaganda, broadcast through The Voice of Fate program fills citizens’ minds with a steady stream of lies and disinformation.
In Book One, “Europe After the Reign,” opening scenes show sixteen-year-old Evey Hammond dressing and readying herself for a foray into prostitution as a way to earn much-needed money. It’s November 5, 1997, a significant date in British history. On this day in 1605, the infamous Guy Fawkes attempted (but failed) to blow up London’s House of Lords in what became known as the Gunpowder Plot. Now, nearly 400 years later, V, the book’s protagonist, disguises himself in a Guy Fawkes mask and recalls the plot to Evey after saving her from being raped and killed by a group of secret police known as “fingermen.” V then successfully blows up London’s Houses of Parliament and brings Evey to his home, the Shadow Gallery, which is filled with books, film, music, and other forms of culture that Norsefire attempted to wipe out after the war. There, Evey reveals she’s been alone since her mother died and state forces imprisoned her father, a former socialist.
Though V remains largely mysterious and his true identity is masked throughout the book, much of his backstory soon comes to light at the Shadow Gallery. V has recently abducted Lewis Prothero (who serves as the actual voice behind The Voice of Fate), and at the Shadow Gallery, V recreates scenes of the now-closed Larkhill Resettlement Camp for Prothero, who had been the camp’s commander. Prothero quickly realizes that V was once imprisoned there, in cell 5, or “V.” Though Prothero insists he was merely following orders, V forces him to recall the atrocities that occurred there as he burns Prothero’s revered doll collection in the Larkhill ovens that Prothero once used to discard human beings.
Larkhill’s history unfolds as V tracks down and kills all those who committed crimes against humanity there, including Bishop Anthony Lilliman, a serial pedophile abetted by the state who spreads its lies in sermons at Westminster Abbey. Soon after, V kills Dr. Delia Surridge, who tells him she knew he would come for her after she learned the suspect has been leaving Violet Carson roses at each crime scene. 
Investigator Eric Finch later learns more about Larkhill Resettlement Camp while reading Dr. Surridge’s diary, conspicuously left in her bedroom, on the night of her killing. Its contents, which Finch reveals in detail to Norsefire’s Leader, Adam Susan, tell a horrific history: Aided by Prothero, Lilliman, and others, Dr. Surridge conducted hormone testing on Larkhill’s prisoners, who she describes in her diary as being subhuman. Prisoners, also routinely tortured, developed grotesque appendages and atrophied genitalia before dying painful deaths. V, however, demonstrated no physical changes and instead experienced a psychotic break that led to increased intellectual powers. Those in charge, considering V harmless, allowed him to garden, and he increased the camp’s food production and grew Violet Carson roses. V’s work allowed him to gather ammonia-based fertilizer, which he later used to create an enormous toxic blast that killed many guards and allowed him to escape Larkhill.
In Book Two, “This Vicious Cabaret,” V kills a crew at Norsefire-controlled studios responsible for producing racist films, and then he takes over London’s airwaves to deliver a message. Human beings, he says, have committed heinous crimes throughout history. V condemns dictators but also berates those who put them power and remained silent as people’s lives and freedoms were stolen. He calls on London’s citizens to be better. 
After state police capture and imprison Evey, she discovers a note left in her cell by a former prisoner named Valerie, a lesbian actress rounded up and then killed by the government. In her letter, Valerie decries Norsefire’s persecution and oppression, but she tells her reader that if people can live with integrity, they can ultimately preserve their personal freedom. After Evey chooses death over signing papers falsely accusing her of crimes, guards say she’s free to go. Once she walks out of her cell, she realizes that V has somehow simulated her entire imprisonment. Though Evey is outraged at first, V tells her he did this because he loves her and wants her to be free from the mental prison that she and her fellow citizens have been locked in under Norsefire’s reign.
Book Three, “The Land of Do-As-You-Please,” begins precisely one year after the book’s opening. As V continues to destroy critical state infrastructure and take over London’s surveillance systems, chaos, looting, and riots consume London’s streets. V’s grand plan is that this phase of disorder will soon give birth to one of creation and true anarchy, a state of order without leaders where people are free to lead themselves. At the defunct Larkhill Resettlement Camp, Eric Finch takes LSD in an attempt to get inside V’s mind and solve the case. His hallucinations begin with grotesque images of corpses strung on barbed wire but eventually lead way to those of happy people of various races and sexual orientations. Suddenly, Finch sees how badly these people were treated, laments the role he played in their demise, and realizes how much he misses and loves them. Finch’s revelations ultimately lead to his mental rebirth and a newfound freedom from Norsefire’s lies.
As chaos continues in London, Rosemary Almond, the widow of Norsefire’s former head of secret police, assassinates Leader Susan. Finch later tracks down and mortally wounds V in an underground train tunnel beneath Victory Station. V tells Finch that he can’t kill the idea and the principles that V represents. Later, V dies in Evey’s arms in the Shadow Gallery, leaving her with a parting request and an enigmatic mission. She then gives him a Viking funeral inside an explosive-packed underground train that blows up Downing Street above and also resolves to discover “who V must be.” Evey’s conclusion leads her to take on V’s cause, and from high on a rooftop, she calls on Britain to now choose freedom and true order over oppression and chains."
Densely,"In a collection of essays, Malcolm Gladwell explores the relationship between power and prestige on the one hand and weakness and struggle on the other. Two theses run through the essays in David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants. The first thesis is that in a contest where one side is obviously superior to the other by conventional standards, the weaker side often has one or more underappreciated advantages. The second thesis is that too much strength can be a bad thing—a phenomenon represented graphically by an inverted-U curve: as strength increases along the horizontal axis, the benefit, on the vertical axis, at first rises but eventually begins to fall.
The Introduction and Part One develop both claims. The first example of hidden advantage on the weaker side is David, the Biblical shepherd boy, who uses a simple sling to overcome the heavily armored and physically imposing warrior Goliath. Later examples include an unskilled girls’ basketball team that wins games with the full-court press, and T. E. Lawrence and his Bedouin guerillas, who use sabotage and surprise to defeat the Turkish army during the First World War.
The moral is that weakness encourages innovation. The basketball team, for instance, adopts the full-court press because the team stands no chance of winning by playing the way other teams do. Gladwell also considers the value of being a Big Fish in a Little Pond instead of a Little Fish in a Big Pond. The French Impressionists found success by creating a Little Pond for themselves, in the form of a self-staged exhibition. Similarly, a college student choosing between a prestigious school and a less-prestigious one will often have a better experience, and will be more successful, at the latter.
A chapter primarily about school class sizes illustrates the concept of the inverted-U curve. According to conventional wisdom, students learn more in small classes than in large ones. This is true, according to Gladwell, for class sizes above twenty-five or so. But a class size of fifteen is smaller than ideal. Family income also illustrates the point: more income is good when it enables a family to afford necessities, but not when the added income makes it harder for parents to say “no” to their children.
Part Two of David and Goliath develops both themes further. Under the right circumstances, personal difficulty can promote the development of valuable skills. Gladwell illustrates this point using several people who grew up with dyslexia. Dyslexia forced trial lawyer David Boies to become an unusually good listener, and it forced film producer Brian Grazer to become an exceptional negotiator. In IKEA founder Ingvar Kamprad and investment banker Gary Cohn, dyslexia fostered a willingness to be “disagreeable”—to do things other disapprove of, like doing business in a communist country or lying your way into a job. A tragically deprived childhood had the same effect on medical pioneer Emil Freireich, who was willing to try treatment techniques that shocked and appalled his colleagues.
Brushes with danger can cause people to become physically more courageous. Here, Gladwell’s examples include the survivors of the London Blitz in World War II and civil rights leader Fred Shuttlesworth. Many of the examples in this section are also examples of inventiveness born of necessity. Freireich, for example, had to find ways to keep his young patients alive when existing techniques were of little use. Wyatt Walker, coordinator of the Birmingham civil rights protests, had to find a way to goad police chief Bull Connor into a response that would attract the country’s attention.
Part Three and the Afterword focus on the limits of government power. Again, the lesson of the inverted-U curve regularly applies. In Belfast, Northern Ireland, in the 1960s, the British government found that applying overwhelming force without establishing legitimacy in the eyes of the population was counterproductive. Conversely, a New York police unit demonstrated that legitimacy makes traditional policing techniques more effective. When it comes to the punishment of violent crime, Gladwell argues that overly harsh sentencing policies, like California’s Three Strikes law, do more harm than good. He makes his case partly with statistics and partly by describing the contrasting ways in which two parents of different murder victims each coped with their loss.
Gladwell’s last two examples are from times of war. During World War II, officials of Vichy France recognized the limits of their power when a small village openly refused to cooperate in the arrest and deportation of Jews. And during the Vietnam War, the U.S. government learned that despite the recommendations of a confident analyst from the RAND corporation, overwhelming financial and material superiority did not guarantee victory over the Viet Cong."
Persuasion,"Persuasion opens with a brief history of the Elliot family as recorded in Sir Walter Elliot's favorite book, The Baronetcy. We learn that the Elliots are a respected, titled, landowning family. Lady Elliot, Sir Walter's wife died fourtee n years ago and left him with three daughters: Elizabeth, Anne, and Mary. Both Elizabeth and Anne are single, but Mary, the youngest is married to a wealthy man named Charles Musgrove; they live close by. Sir Walter, who lavishly overspends, has brought the family into great debt. When Lady Russell, a trusted family advisor, suggests that the Elliots reduce their spending, Sir Walter is horrified. He is exceedingly vain and cannot bear to imagine life without his usual comforts. But with no other option, the Elliots decide they must relocate to a house in Bath where their expenses will be more manageable. They intend to rent the family estate, Kellynch Hall.
They soon find excellent tenants to rent their home; Admiral and Mrs. Croft are wealthy and well-mannered Navy people who have a model marriage. Sir Walter is relieved that the Admiral is a good-looking man. Though Sir Walter dislikes that the Navy brings ""men of obscure birth into undue distinction,"" he is satisfied with Admiral and Mrs. Croft as tenants for his home. Anne Elliot, the middle daughter, is also excited to meet the Crofts; Mrs. Croft is the sister of the man Anne loves. Eight years ago, she was engaged to be married to Captain Frederick Wentworth, but Lady Russell persuaded her that Captain Wentworth was not of high enough consequence, and Anne called off the engagement. With the Crofts at Kellynch, Anne hopes to see Captain Wentworth again.
Sir Walter, Elizabeth, and Mrs. Clay (a widowed, somewhat lower-class friend of the family) leave for Bath. Anne goes to stay with her sister Mary at Uppercross Cottage for a period of two months. Mary complains often and Anne patiently listens to her sister's worries. At Uppercross, Anne finds the Musgrove family delightful. Mr. and Mrs. Musgrove have three grown children: Charles (Mary's husband), Henrietta, and Louisa. Anne marvels at the bustling nature of the household and the Musgroves' clear affection for their children. Soon news comes that Captain Wentworth has returned from sea and is staying with his sister at Kellynch. Captain Wentworth makes friends with Mr. Musgrove, and he becomes a daily visitor at Uppercross. Anne is at first anxious to see him again after such a long time, but his actions toward her are merely detached and polite. He seems more smitten with Henrietta and Louisa Musgrove. Anne resigns herself to the idea that she has lost Captain Wentworth's love forever.
Captain Wentworth proposes that they all take a trip to Lyme to go visit his friends the Harvilles. While they are there, a good-looking gentleman takes notice of Anne; they later discover that this man is Mr. Elliot, Anne's cousin and Sir Walter' s heir to Kellynch. The group decides to go for a morning walk on the beach. Louisa Musgrove has a bad fall and is knocked unconscious. Anne keeps a level head and does all she can to care for Louisa. The doctor determines that Louisa will recover, but she will have to remain in Lyme for several months. Captain Wentworth blames himself for Louisa's fall and tries to help the Musgrove family. Anne returns to Uppercross to help Mr. and Mrs. Musgrove care for their younger children. After a few weeks, she leaves to stay with Lady Russell.
After Christmas, Lady Russell and Anne decide that they must rejoin the rest of the Elliot family in Bath, much to Anne's dismay. Sir Walter and Elizabeth care little about her, but they are glad to have her come to Bath. In Bath, she is formally introduced to her cousin Mr. Elliot, who has made peace with his once estranged uncle, Sir Walter. Though she questions Mr. Elliot's motives for his sudden apology, she accepts him as a pleasing gentleman. Mr. Elliot is extraordinarily appreciative of Anne, and i t is soon apparent that he seeks to make her his wife. While in Bath, Anne becomes reacquainted with an old school friend, Mrs. Smith, who has recently been widowed and fallen into hard times. From Mrs. Smith, Anne learns about Mr. Elliot's hidden past; she finds out that he has mistreated Mrs. Smith and that he plans to marry Anne to ensure that he becomes the sole heir of the Kellynch baronetcy. Mr. Elliot fears that Sir Walter will marry Mrs. Clay, have a son, and thereby deprive him of his title. He plots to ensure that he will remain Sir Walter's heir. Anne is appalled to hear this news.
The Crofts arrive in Bath with news of two engagements; Henrietta will marry her cousin Charles Hayter, and Louisa will marry Captain Benwick, a man she met at Lyme while she was convalescing. Anne is overjoyed that Captain Wentworth is not promised to Louisa and is free once again. Captain Wentworth soon arrives in Bath. He is now a much richer man than he was eight years ago, and Sir Walter reluctantly admits him into their social circle. Wentworth grows jealous because he believes Anne is attached to her cousin Mr. Elliot. Yet he writes Anne a love letter in which he describes his true, constant, and undying love for her. Anne is thrilled and they become engaged. Mr. Elliot is shocked that his plan to marry Anne has been foiled. He and Mrs. Clay leave Bath. It is rumored that they are together. There is no longer any danger that Sir Walter will marry beneath his station. Sir Walter and Lady Russell give their approval for the marriage between Anne and Captain Wentworth."
Eminently,"On their weekly walk, an eminently sensible, trustworthy lawyer named Mr. Utterson listens as his friend Enfield tells a gruesome tale of assault. The tale describes a sinister figure named Mr. Hyde who tramples a young girl, disappears into a door on the street, and reemerges to pay off her relatives with a check signed by a respectable gentleman. Since both Utterson and Enfield disapprove of gossip, they agree to speak no further of the matter. It happens, however, that one of Utterson’s clients and close friends, Dr. Jekyll, has written a will transferring all of his property to this same Mr. Hyde. Soon, Utterson begins having dreams in which a faceless figure stalks through a nightmarish version of London.
Puzzled, the lawyer visits Jekyll and their mutual friend Dr. Lanyon to try to learn more. Lanyon reports that he no longer sees much of Jekyll, since they had a dispute over the course of Jekyll’s research, which Lanyon calls “unscientific balderdash.” Curious, Utterson stakes out a building that Hyde visits—which, it turns out, is a laboratory attached to the back of Jekyll’s home. Encountering Hyde, Utterson is amazed by how undefinably ugly the man seems, as if deformed, though Utterson cannot say exactly how. Much to Utterson’s surprise, Hyde willingly offers Utterson his address. Jekyll tells Utterson not to concern himself with the matter of Hyde.
A year passes uneventfully. Then, one night, a servant girl witnesses Hyde brutally beat to death an old man named Sir Danvers Carew, a member of Parliament and a client of Utterson. The police contact Utterson, and Utterson suspects Hyde as the murderer. He leads the officers to Hyde’s apartment, feeling a sense of foreboding amid the eerie weather—the morning is dark and wreathed in fog. When they arrive at the apartment, the murderer has vanished, and police searches prove futile. Shortly thereafter, Utterson again visits Jekyll, who now claims to have ended all relations with Hyde; he shows Utterson a note, allegedly written to Jekyll by Hyde, apologizing for the trouble he has caused him and saying goodbye. That night, however, Utterson’s clerk points out that Hyde’s handwriting bears a remarkable similarity to Jekyll’s own.
For a few months, Jekyll acts especially friendly and sociable, as if a weight has been lifted from his shoulders. But then Jekyll suddenly begins to refuse visitors, and Lanyon dies from some kind of shock he received in connection with Jekyll. Before dying, however, Lanyon gives Utterson a letter, with instructions that he not open it until after Jekyll’s death. Meanwhile, Utterson goes out walking with Enfield, and they see Jekyll at a window of his laboratory; the three men begin to converse, but a look of horror comes over Jekyll’s face, and he slams the window and disappears. Soon afterward, Jekyll’s butler, Mr. Poole, visits Utterson in a state of desperation: Jekyll has secluded himself in his laboratory for several weeks, and now the voice that comes from the room sounds nothing like the doctor’s. Utterson and Poole travel to Jekyll’s house through empty, windswept, sinister streets; once there, they find the servants huddled together in fear. After arguing for a time, the two of them resolve to break into Jekyll’s laboratory. Inside, they find the body of Hyde, wearing Jekyll’s clothes and apparently dead by suicide—and a letter from Jekyll to Utterson promising to explain everything.
Utterson takes the document home, where first he reads Lanyon’s letter; it reveals that Lanyon’s deterioration and eventual death were caused by the shock of seeing Mr. Hyde take a potion and metamorphose into Dr. Jekyll. The second letter constitutes a testament by Jekyll. It explains how Jekyll, seeking to separate his good side from his darker impulses, discovered a way to transform himself periodically into a deformed monster free of conscience—Mr. Hyde. At first, Jekyll reports, he delighted in becoming Hyde and rejoiced in the moral freedom that the creature possessed. Eventually, however, he found that he was turning into Hyde involuntarily in his sleep, even without taking the potion. At this point, Jekyll resolved to cease becoming Hyde. One night, however, the urge gripped him too strongly, and after the transformation he immediately rushed out and violently killed Sir Danvers Carew. Horrified, Jekyll tried more adamantly to stop the transformations, and for a time he proved successful; one day, however, while sitting in a park, he suddenly turned into Hyde, the first time that an involuntary metamorphosis had happened while he was awake.
The letter continues describing Jekyll’s cry for help. Far from his laboratory and hunted by the police as a murderer, Hyde needed Lanyon’s help to get his potions and become Jekyll again—but when he undertook the transformation in Lanyon’s presence, the shock of the sight instigated Lanyon’s deterioration and death. Meanwhile, Jekyll returned to his home, only to find himself ever more helpless and trapped as the transformations increased in frequency and necessitated even larger doses of potion in order to reverse themselves. It was the onset of one of these spontaneous metamorphoses that caused Jekyll to slam his laboratory window shut in the middle of his conversation with Enfield and Utterson. Eventually, the potion began to run out, and Jekyll was unable to find a key ingredient to make more. His ability to change back from Hyde into Jekyll slowly vanished. Jekyll writes that even as he composes his letter he knows that he will soon become Hyde permanently, and he wonders if Hyde will face execution for his crimes or choose to kill himself. Jekyll notes that, in any case, the end of his letter marks the end of the life of Dr. Jekyll. With these words, both the document and the novel come to a close."
What,"A Raisin in the Sun portrays a few weeks in the life of the Youngers, a Black family living on the South Side of Chicago in the 1950s. When the play opens, the Youngers are about to receive an insurance check for $10,000. This money comes from the deceased Mr. Younger’s life insurance policy. Each of the adult members of the family has an idea as to what he or she would like to do with this money. The matriarch of the family, Mama, wants to buy a house to fulfill a dream she shared with her husband. Mama’s son, Walter Lee, would rather use the money to invest in a liquor store with his friends. He believes that the investment will solve the family’s financial problems forever. Walter’s wife, Ruth, agrees with Mama, however, and hopes that she and Walter can provide more space and opportunity for their son, Travis. Finally, Beneatha, Walter’s sister and Mama’s daughter, wants to use the money for her medical school tuition. She also wishes that her family members were not so interested in assimilating into the white world. Beneatha instead tries to find her identity by looking back to the past and to Africa.
As the play progresses, the Youngers clash over their competing dreams. Ruth discovers that she is pregnant but fears that if she has the child, she will put more financial pressure on her family members. When Walter says nothing to Ruth’s admission that she is considering abortion, Mama puts a down payment on a house for the whole family. She believes that a bigger, brighter dwelling will help them all. This house is in Clybourne Park, an entirely white neighborhood. When the Youngers’ future neighbors find out that the Youngers are moving in, they send Mr. Lindner, from the Clybourne Park Improvement Association, to offer the Youngers money in return for staying away. The Youngers refuse the deal, even after Walter loses the rest of the money ($6,500) to his friend Willy Harris, who persuades Walter to invest in the liquor store and then runs off with his cash.
In the meantime, Beneatha rejects her suitor, George Murchison, whom she believes to be shallow and blind to the problems of race. Subsequently, she receives a marriage proposal from her Nigerian boyfriend, Joseph Asagai, who wants Beneatha to get a medical degree and move to Africa with him (Beneatha does not make her choice before the end of the play). The Youngers eventually move out of the apartment, fulfilling the family’s long-held dream. Their future seems uncertain and slightly dangerous, but they are optimistic and determined to live a better life. They believe that they can succeed if they stick together as a family and resolve to defer their dreams no longer."
Cities,"The year is 1775, and social ills plague both France and England. Jerry Cruncher, an odd-job man who works for Tellson’s Bank, stops the Dover mail-coach with an urgent message for Jarvis Lorry. The message instructs Lorry to wait at Dover for a young woman, and Lorry responds with the cryptic words, “Recalled to Life.” At Dover, Lorry is met by Lucie Manette, a young orphan whose father, a once-eminent doctor whom she supposed dead, has been discovered in France. Lorry escorts Lucie to Paris, where they meet Defarge, a former servant of Doctor Manette, who has kept Manette safe in a garret. Driven mad by eighteen years in the Bastille, Manette spends all of his time making shoes, a hobby he learned while in prison. Lorry assures Lucie that her love and devotion can recall her father to life, and indeed they do.
The year is now 1780. Charles Darnay stands accused of treason against the English crown. A bombastic lawyer named Stryver pleads Darnay’s case, but it is not until his drunk, good-for-nothing colleague, Sydney Carton, assists him that the court acquits Darnay. Carton clinches his argument by pointing out that he himself bears an uncanny resemblance to the defendant, which undermines the prosecution’s case for unmistakably identifying Darnay as the spy the authorities spotted. Lucie and Doctor Manette watched the court proceedings, and that night, Carton escorts Darnay to a tavern and asks how it feels to receive the sympathy of a woman like Lucie. Carton despises and resents Darnay because he reminds him of all that he himself has given up and might have been.
In France, the cruel Marquis Evrémonde runs down a plebian child with his carriage. Manifesting an attitude typical of the aristocracy in regard to the poor at that time, the Marquis shows no regret, but instead curses the peasantry and hurries home to his chateau, where he awaits the arrival of his nephew, Darnay, from England. Arriving later that night, Darnay curses his uncle and the French aristocracy for its abominable treatment of the people. He renounces his identity as an Evrémonde and announces his intention to return to England. That night, the Marquis is murdered; the murderer has left a note signed with the nickname adopted by French revolutionaries: “Jacques.”
A year passes, and Darnay asks Manette for permission to marry Lucie. He says that, if Lucie accepts, he will reveal his true identity to Manette. Carton, meanwhile, also pledges his love to Lucie, admitting that, though his life is worthless, she has helped him dream of a better, more valuable existence. On the streets of London, Jerry Cruncher gets swept up in the funeral procession for a spy named Roger Cly. Later that night, he demonstrates his talents as a “Resurrection-Man,” sneaking into the cemetery to steal and sell Cly’s body. In Paris, meanwhile, another English spy known as John Barsad drops into Defarge’s wine shop. Barsad hopes to turn up evidence concerning the mounting revolution, which is still in its covert stages. Madame Defarge sits in the shop knitting a secret registry of those whom the revolution seeks to execute. Back in London, Darnay, on the morning of his wedding, keeps his promise to Manette; he reveals his true identity and, that night, Manette relapses into his old prison habit of making shoes. After nine days, Manette regains his presence of mind, and soon joins the newlyweds on their honeymoon. Upon Darnay’s return, Carton pays him a visit and asks for his friendship. Darnay assures Carton that he is always welcome in their home.
The year is now 1789. The peasants in Paris storm the Bastille and the French Revolution begins. The revolutionaries murder aristocrats in the streets, and Gabelle, a man charged with the maintenance of the Evrémonde estate, is imprisoned. Three years later, he writes to Darnay, asking to be rescued. Despite the threat of great danger to his person, Darnay departs immediately for France.
As soon as Darnay arrives in Paris, the French revolutionaries arrest him as an emigrant. Lucie and Manette make their way to Paris in hopes of saving him. Darnay remains in prison for a year and three months before receiving a trial. In order to help free him, Manette uses his considerable influence with the revolutionaries, who sympathize with him for having served time in the Bastille. Darnay receives an acquittal, but that same night he is arrested again. The charges, this time, come from Defarge and his vengeful wife. Carton arrives in Paris with a plan to rescue Darnay and obtains the help of John Barsad, who turns out to be Solomon Pross, the long-lost brother of Miss Pross, Lucie’s loyal servant.
At Darnay’s trial, Defarge produces a letter that he discovered in Manette’s old jail cell in the Bastille. The letter explains the cause of Manette’s imprisonment. Years ago, the brothers Evrémonde (Darnay’s father and uncle) enlisted Manette’s medical assistance. They asked him to tend to a woman, whom one of the brothers had raped, and her brother, whom the same brother had stabbed fatally. Fearing that Manette might report their misdeeds, the Evrémondes had him arrested. Upon hearing this story, the jury condemns Darnay for the crimes of his ancestors and sentences him to die within twenty-four hours. That night, at the Defarge’s wine shop, Carton overhears Madame Defarge plotting to have Lucie and her daughter (also Darnay’s daughter) executed as well; Madame Defarge, it turns out, is the surviving sibling of the man and woman killed by the Evrémondes. Carton arranges for the Manettes’ immediate departure from France. He then visits Darnay in prison, tricks him into changing clothes with him, and, after dictating a letter of explanation, drugs his friend unconscious. Barsad carries Darnay, now disguised as Carton, to an awaiting coach, while Carton, disguised as Darnay, awaits execution. As Darnay, Lucie, their child, and Dr. Manette speed away from Paris, Madame Defarge arrives at Lucie’s apartment, hoping to arrest her. There she finds the supremely protective Miss Pross. A scuffle ensues, and Madame Defarge dies by the bullet of her own gun. Sydney Carton meets his death at the guillotine, and the narrator confidently asserts that Carton dies with the knowledge that he has finally imbued his life with meaning."
Evident,"Lawyer Bryan Stevenson gives a first-person account of his decades helping marginalized Americans who have been unfairly and harshly punished by the U.S. criminal justice system, which disproportionately targets people of color and poor people. At the heart of Just Mercy is the story of Walter McMillian, a Black man who was framed for the murder of a girl named Ronda Morrison, convicted, and sent to death row. 
Stevenson alternates chapters about Walter with his personal reflections on our country’s history with racial disparity and issues around incarceration. Stevenson highlights other groups of vulnerable people who have been victimized by the criminal justice system and shares the stories of the prisoners he has helped over the years. The book also follows the growth of Stevenson’s nonprofit law project, the Alabama-based Equal Justice Initiative (EJI), through its expansion from focusing on death row prisoners to helping people sentenced to life without parole. Stevenson chronicles how EJI becomes a significant force in criminal justice reform.
In 1983 as a law student, Stevenson discovers his life’s passion when he interns with the Georgia-based Southern Prisoners Defense Committee and meets his first death row prisoner. After graduation Stevenson accepts a job with the organization to represent poor prisoners, including those in Alabama who lack any public defender. He meets Walter McMillian on Alabama’s death row. Walter owns a successful business but also transgresses racial boundaries when he has an affair with a white woman. Soon after the affair becomes public, the woman’s friend, Ralph Myers, accuses Walter of committing the unsolved murder of Ronda Morrison, which has outraged the community. Law enforcement, including a racist sheriff and the district attorney, eagerly pounces on this accusation, overlooking Walter’s alibi and a lack of evidence. Instead, they actively force Ralph to stick with his story even when he tries to recant. They coerce other false witness testimonies, and—as revealed years later—actively suppress evidence.
After Stevenson and the team at EJI unsuccessfully appeal Walter’s conviction, they launch their own investigation of the crime and uncover new evidence. They find witnesses who can prove the witnesses against Walter lied as well as financial records that indicate that one of these witnesses was paid to give false testimony. Stevenson and his team also petition for and receive all records from Walter’s trial. However, their big break comes when they receive a phone call from Ralph, who now wants to make amends. Ralph admits to lying about Walter and says he was threatened by law enforcement. Stevenson wins a hearing for Walter where he can present his new evidence: Ralph’s testimony, which is confirmed by health care workers and other inmates, as well as recordings of the law enforcement team threatening Ralph if he doesn’t frame Walter. 
While the judge refuses to grant Walter relief, Stevenson continues the appeal process through the Alabama courts. The district attorney asks outside agents to investigate the murder for which Walter was convicted, and the investigators determine that Walter had nothing to do with the crime. Six weeks later, the court invalidates Walter’s conviction. Stevenson and the State file a joint motion to dismiss the charges, and Walter is set free.
Throughout the process, Stevenson and Walter become close friends, and Stevenson helps Walter upon his release, including filing a civil suit on his behalf and offering him a place to stay. Walter works with Stevenson to share his story, giving interviews and speaking at legal conferences, and Walter is even featured in a documentary. Unfortunately, Walter is diagnosed with advancing dementia and is forced to rely on family and eventually a nursing facility for his care. He dies in 2013. Stevenson gives a eulogy at his funeral and shares all he learned from Walter, particularly that we must extend mercy to everyone, even those who have not earned it.
Interspersed with chapters chronicling Walter’s narrative are stories of Stevenson’s other clients and work. His closeness with these prisoners and their horrifying circumstances makes Stevenson more determined to help and causes him to reflect on abstract issues that nevertheless imbue the criminal justice system, like humanity and mercy. Stevenson focuses on several categories of vulnerable people who become trapped in the system, including mentally ill prisoners, disabled prisoners, and poor women who give birth to stillborn babies. 
Stevenson and his team at EJI also become increasingly focused on juvenile offenders who are sometimes tried as adults despite their young age. These offenders may be given de facto death sentences by being sentenced to life without parole and face perilous circumstances when they are housed in adult prisons. Stevenson illustrates how these prisoners retain their own humanity while being forced to live under inhumane conditions. He also discusses some of the qualities common among these types of prisoners: They are generally poor and disproportionately people of color, and most of them lack adequate legal counsel. The juveniles have horrific backgrounds of abuse and neglect.
Stevenson and his team at EJI also work to change the legal system to offer more protection to marginalized people. Several of his cases end up before the U.S. Supreme Court, and he succeeds in winning rulings that ban as unconstitutional the conviction of children to life without parole and the execution of people deemed incompetent from dementia or neurological disease. EJI works to raise public awareness of issues surrounding unfair incarceration, produces groundbreaking reports on racial issues, and sets up programs to help formerly incarcerated people adjust to life on the outside.
Stevenson also reflects on the issues that surround the criminal justice system. His time spent with prisoners awaiting their execution makes him realize how inhumane it is to prepare another human to die. After decades of work, when Stevenson fails to prevent the execution of a man who suffers from an intellectual disability, he momentarily feels unable to continue his work. However, he realizes that he cannot help but be broken by his experiences and comes to understand that it is his own brokenness that allows him to more fully understand the need for mercy and to bring compassion to others. The book ends with Stevenson’s renewed commitment to helping others."
Vital,"Never Let Me Go takes place in a dystopian version of late 1990s England, where the lives of ordinary citizens are prolonged through a state-sanctioned program of human cloning. The clones, referred to as students, grow up in special institutions away from the outside world. As young adults, they begin to donate their vital organs. All “donors” receive care from designated “carers,” clones who have not yet begun the donation process. The clones continue to donate organs until they “complete,” which is a euphemism for death after the donation of three or four organs. However, this premise is not immediately apparent to the reader. At the start of the novel, narrator Kathy H. merely introduces herself as a thirty-one-year-old carer. She has been a carer for nearly twelve years, but will leave her role in a few months. Kathy explains that she wants to revisit her memories of Tommy and Ruth, two friends who grew up with her at the Hailsham school. Kathy does not explain the donation program, or mention that Hailsham students are clones.
Although Kathy’s narration is often nonlinear, the novel’s three parts roughly align with three stages in her life. In Part One, Kathy remembers her childhood at Hailsham. She describes her friendship with Ruth, whose temperamental personality contrasts with her own quiet demeanor. At Hailsham, Ruth often annoys Kathy by pretending to have special knowledge and privileges. Kathy also describes Tommy, a student known for throwing violent temper tantrums. Tommy is initially an outcast among his peers because he lacks artistic ability, which the Hailsham staff (part teacher, part parent figures known as “guardians”), and its students value highly. Kathy sympathizes with Tommy, and tries to calm him down during one of his tantrums. Tommy later learns to control his temper after a guardian named Miss Lucy assures him that it is not necessary for him to be creative.
Although the students learn vaguely about the donation program, their guardians shield them from a full understanding of their future. Miss Lucy disagrees with this indirect approach, and often exhibits strange behavior in front of the students as a result, in one instance telling them explicitly about their futures. After Miss Lucy speaks with Tommy about his artwork, he and Kathy theorize that creativity may be connected to donations. They speculate about Madame, a woman who visits Hailsham to collect the best student artwork. Madame is rumored to keep this art in a personal gallery. Kathy later encounters Madame in the girls’ dormitory, while Kathy dances to the song “Never Let Me Go.” The song is Kathy’s favorite track on Songs After Dark, a Judy Bridgewater album that is one of her most prized possessions. When the song ends, Kathy sees Madame crying in the doorway. Shortly afterwards, Kathy loses her tape. Tommy’s temper returns during their last summer at Hailsham. Kathy thinks he is upset about his recent breakup with Ruth, whom he has dated for six months. But Tommy is upset about Miss Lucy, who recently told him that she was wrong to dismiss the importance of creativity. Miss Lucy departs Hailsham abruptly, and Tommy mends his relationship with Ruth.
In Part Two, Kathy moves with Ruth and Tommy to a transitional housing facility known as the Cottages. They adjust to their new lives, becoming acquainted with the “veteran” students living there already. Ruth often ignores Tommy and Kathy in her efforts to blend in with the veterans, who are not from Hailsham. Kathy notices that the veterans regard the Hailsham students with awe. One couple, Chrissie and Rodney, are especially interested in Hailsham. They convince Ruth to go with them to Norfolk, where Rodney claims to have seen Ruth’s “possible” in an open-plan office (a “possible” is a human that resembles a specific clone and from whom that clone's DNA may have been copied). Kathy is skeptical of Rodney’s story, especially since it features Ruth’s “dream future” of working in an open-plan office. In the end, Kathy, Tommy, Ruth, Rodney, and Chrissie all drive to Norfolk.
In Norfolk, Chrissie and Rodney ask about a rumored exception allowing Hailsham couples in love to defer their donations. Ruth pretends to know something about deferrals, which surprises Kathy and Tommy. The students eventually find the open-plan office. Rodney points to a woman in the window, and they all agree that she could be Ruth’s legitimate possible. They follow her to an art gallery, where they realize that the woman does not actually resemble Ruth. In her disappointment, Ruth says that the students are modeled only on “trash.” Ruth goes off with Chrissie and Rodney. Meanwhile, Tommy and Kathy find a copy of Kathy’s lost tape in a secondhand store. Tommy tells Kathy that he has begun drawing pictures of imaginary animals. He thinks Madame uses the students’ artwork to determine if couples applying for deferrals are truly in love. After Norfolk, Ruth stops talking about her dream future. Tommy shows his drawings to Kathy, who finds them puzzling but captivating. Meanwhile, Kathy’s friendship with Ruth grows increasingly tense. Ruth reveals that she knows Kathy likes Tommy, but says that Tommy will never return Kathy’s feelings. Shortly afterwards, Kathy submits her application for carer training and departs.
Part Three focuses on Kathy’s time as carer. While Kathy is good at her job, the work is both difficult and lonely. She unexpectedly runs into a Hailsham friend named Laura, who is also a carer. They talk about Ruth, who had a bad first donation. They also talk about Hailsham, which has closed. Kathy becomes Ruth’s carer, but their relationship is strained and guarded. One day, Ruth expresses a desire to visit a beached fishing boat near Tommy’s recovery center. They pick up Tommy on the way to the boat, which they find bleached and crumbling in a marsh. The marsh reminds both Tommy and Ruth of Hailsham. They also discuss Chrissie, who completed on her second donation. On the return trip, Ruth apologizes for keeping Tommy and Kathy apart. She encourages them to pursue a deferral, revealing that she has discovered Madame’s home address. In the weeks that follow, Kathy and Ruth reminisce peacefully about Hailsham and the Cottages. Ruth also encourages Kathy to become Tommy’s carer.
Ruth completes after her second donation. Tommy gives his third donation, and Kathy becomes his carer. They spend their days reading and talking at his recovery center. Eventually, they also begin to have sex. Hoping to pursue a deferral, they go to visit Madame at the address Ruth provided. Madame invites them inside and listens to their request, after which Miss Emily appears from the next room. Miss Emily says that deferrals do not exist. She explains that Hailsham was part of a progressive movement committed to raising clones more humanely. Madame used to exhibit the students’ artwork to show the outside world that clones had souls. Although the movement once had many supporters, changing public opinion eventually forced Hailsham to close. On the drive back to his recovery center, Tommy asks Kathy to pull over. He walks into the woods and begins screaming. Kathy goes to Tommy and holds him. Soon after, Tommy gives his fourth donation and completes. Kathy drives to a field in Norfolk, where she allows herself to imagine Tommy on the horizon. Then she drives away."
West,"Saeed and Nadia are young adults living in an unnamed city on the brink of war. Saeed asks Nadia to coffee, and they begin to date. However, between societal rules restricting men and women being in public together and escalating tension between the government and a militant group, they rarely get to see each other. Because Saeed lives with his parents, he sometimes goes to Nadia’s flat, disguising himself as a woman to not cause a scandal. Otherwise, they text frequently. Then, the government cuts off all cellular and Wi-Fi service as a counterterrorism measure, which also cuts Saeed and Nadia off from each other. Saeed searches everywhere for Nadia and finally waits all day at her flat for her to return. He begs her to move in with him and his parents, but Nadia is reluctant. When Saeed’s mother gets killed by stray gunfire, Nadia relents and moves in with Saeed and his father. As the fighting worsens, Saeed and Nadia hear rumors about magical doors that can transport people anywhere in the world. They don’t believe these rumors. 
The militants eventually take the city, imposing strict rules and surveillance. They hold public executions of those who break their religious rules and those who belong to certain religious denominations. Desperate to escape, Saeed and Nadia meet with a man who agrees to secure them passage out of the city via a magical door. He takes their money and agrees to get in contact. When they hear from him again, Saeed’s father announces he will not go with them. He makes Nadia promise to stay with Saeed until Saeed is safe and settled. The next day, Saeed and Nadia pack small backpacks full of supplies and meet the mysterious man at the rendezvous point. He sends them through a door. They emerge on the island of Mykonos, where a large refugee camp has grown. Wealthy countries have also discovered these doors and keep them strictly guarded to try and cut back on the number of refugees in their countries. After a few months, Nadia befriends a local girl who promises to help them leave Mykonos. The girl makes good on her promise and sneaks Saeed and Nadia through a newly discovered door.
They emerge in an empty mansion in London and stay in one of the rooms. Other refugees come to live in the house alongside them. Saeed and Nadia start to feel less in love and become more irritated with each other because of the stress of their ordeal. Some London citizens attack refugees, but others volunteer to bring food and medicine into the occupied houses. The British government cuts the power to the neighborhood. As more refugees enter London, they divide themselves by national origin. Saeed would like to move to another house to be closer to others from their country, but Nadia prefers to stay where they are. Eventually, the British government begins a push to make the migrants leave the houses they’ve occupied. There is a violent siege, but the government finally relents. The government plans to build a halo city on London’s outskirts for the migrants to live in. Saeed and Nadia move to a work camp and build houses so that they can someday earn a forty-meter house of their own. Between exhaustion and their fizzling romance, they fall into a rut. Nadia suggests they move to Marin in California. 
Nadia and Saeed set up a shanty house in Marin. Nadia starts working at a co-op, and Saeed finds solace in a Black-majority religious congregation. Even though they both settle into their new lives, they find themselves changing. Nadia begins to realize that she’s bisexual, and Saeed becomes attracted to the daughter of the preacher at his congregation. Although they still enjoy each other’s company, they begin to feel more like friends than lovers. They don’t want their relationship to sour, and they know they have to separate. One day, Nadia simply packs her things and leaves. She moves into a room at the co-op where she works and later starts dating one of her coworkers. Saeed grows closer to the preacher’s daughter, and they start dating. Although their separation is difficult at first, Saeed and Nadia eventually fall out of touch. Fifty years later, they meet again in a café in the city they once fled from together. Saeed talks about the stars in the Chilean desert and offers to take Nadia someday. They leave not knowing if they’ll ever see each other again."
Honesty,"Jack Worthing, the play’s protagonist, is a pillar of the community in Hertfordshire, where he is guardian to Cecily Cardew, the pretty, eighteen-year-old granddaughter of the late Thomas Cardew, who found and adopted Jack when he was a baby. In Hertfordshire, Jack has responsibilities: he is a major landowner and justice of the peace, with tenants, farmers, and a number of servants and other employees all dependent on him. For years, he has also pretended to have an irresponsible black-sheep brother named Ernest who leads a scandalous life in pursuit of pleasure and is always getting into trouble of a sort that requires Jack to rush grimly off to his assistance. In fact, Ernest is merely Jack’s alibi, a phantom that allows him to disappear for days at a time and do as he likes. No one but Jack knows that he himself is Ernest. Ernest is the name Jack goes by in London, which is where he really goes on these occasions—probably to pursue the very sort of behavior he pretends to disapprove of in his imaginary brother.
Jack is in love with Gwendolen Fairfax, the cousin of his best friend, Algernon Moncrieff. When the play opens, Algernon, who knows Jack as Ernest, has begun to suspect something, having found an inscription inside Jack’s cigarette case addressed to “Uncle Jack” from someone who refers to herself as “little Cecily.” Algernon suspects that Jack may be leading a double life, a practice he seems to regard as commonplace and indispensable to modern life. He calls a person who leads a double life a “Bunburyist,” after a nonexistent friend he pretends to have, a chronic invalid named Bunbury, to whose deathbed he is forever being summoned whenever he wants to get out of some tiresome social obligation.
At the beginning of Act 1, Jack drops in unexpectedly on Algernon and announces that he intends to propose to Gwendolen. Algernon confronts him with the cigarette case and forces him to come clean, demanding to know who “Jack” and “Cecily” are. Jack confesses that his name isn’t really Ernest and that Cecily is his ward, a responsibility imposed on him by his adoptive father’s will. Jack also tells Algernon about his fictional brother. Jack says he’s been thinking of killing off this fake brother, since Cecily has been showing too active an interest in him. Without meaning to, Jack describes Cecily in terms that catch Algernon’s attention and make him even more interested in her than he is already.
Gwendolen and her mother, Lady Bracknell, arrive, which gives Jack an opportunity to propose to Gwendolen. Jack is delighted to discover that Gwendolen returns his affections, but he is alarmed to learn that Gwendolen is fixated on the name Ernest, which she says “inspires absolute confidence.” Gwendolen makes clear that she would not consider marrying a man who was not named Ernest.
Lady Bracknell interviews Jack to determine his eligibility as a possible son-in-law, and during this interview she asks about his family background. When Jack explains that he has no idea who his parents were and that he was found, by the man who adopted him, in a handbag in the cloakroom at Victoria Station, Lady Bracknell is scandalized. She forbids the match between Jack and Gwendolen and sweeps out of the house.
In Act 2, Algernon shows up at Jack’s country estate posing as Jack’s brother Ernest. Meanwhile, Jack, having decided that Ernest has outlived his usefulness, arrives home in deep mourning, full of a story about Ernest having died suddenly in Paris. He is enraged to find Algernon there masquerading as Ernest but has to go along with the charade. If he doesn’t, his own lies and deceptions will be revealed.
While Jack changes out of his mourning clothes, Algernon, who has fallen hopelessly in love with Cecily, asks her to marry him. He is surprised to discover that Cecily already considers that they are engaged, and he is charmed when she reveals that her fascination with “Uncle Jack’s brother” led her to invent an elaborate romance between herself and him several months ago. Algernon is less enchanted to learn that part of Cecily’s interest in him derives from the name Ernest, which, unconsciously echoing Gwendolen, she says “inspires absolute confidence.”
Algernon goes off in search of Dr. Chasuble, the local rector, to see about getting himself christened Ernest. Meanwhile, Gwendolen arrives, having decided to pay Jack an unexpected visit. Gwendolen is shown into the garden, where Cecily orders tea and attempts to play hostess. Cecily has no idea how Gwendolen figures into Jack’s life, and Gwendolen, for her part, has no idea who Cecily is. Gwendolen initially thinks Cecily is a visitor to the Manor House and is disconcerted to learn that Cecily is “Mr. Worthing’s ward.” She notes that Ernest has never mentioned having a ward, and Cecily explains that it is not Ernest Worthing who is her guardian but his brother Jack and, in fact, that she is engaged to be married to Ernest Worthing. Gwendolen points out that this is impossible as she herself is engaged to Ernest Worthing. The tea party degenerates into a war of manners.
Jack and Algernon arrive toward the climax of this confrontation, each having separately made arrangements with Dr. Chasuble to be christened Ernest later that day. Each of the young ladies points out that the other has been deceived: Cecily informs Gwendolen that her fiancé is really named Jack and Gwendolen informs Cecily that hers is really called Algernon. The two women demand to know where Jack’s brother Ernest is, since both of them are engaged to be married to him. Jack is forced to admit that he has no brother and that Ernest is a complete fiction. Both women are shocked and furious, and they retire to the house arm in arm.
Act 3 takes place in the drawing room of the Manor House, where Cecily and Gwendolen have retired. When Jack and Algernon enter from the garden, the two women confront them. Cecily asks Algernon why he pretended to be her guardian’s brother. Algernon tells her he did it in order to meet her. Gwendolen asks Jack whether he pretended to have a brother in order to come into London to see her as often as possible, and she interprets his evasive reply as an affirmation. The women are somewhat appeased but still concerned over the issue of the name. However, when Jack and Algernon tell Gwendolen and Cecily that they have both made arrangements to be christened Ernest that afternoon, all is forgiven and the two pairs of lovers embrace. At this moment, Lady Bracknell’s arrival is announced.
Lady Bracknell has followed Gwendolen from London, having bribed Gwendolen’s maid to reveal her destination. She demands to know what is going on. Gwendolen again informs Lady Bracknell of her engagement to Jack, and Lady Bracknell reiterates that a union between them is out of the question. Algernon tells Lady Bracknell of his engagement to Cecily, prompting her to inspect Cecily and inquire into her social connections, which she does in a routine and patronizing manner that infuriates Jack. He replies to all her questions with a mixture of civility and sarcasm, withholding until the last possible moment the information that Cecily is actually worth a great deal of money and stands to inherit still more when she comes of age. At this, Lady Bracknell becomes genuinely interested.
Jack informs Lady Bracknell that, as Cecily’s legal guardian, he refuses to give his consent to her union with Algernon. Lady Bracknell suggests that the two young people simply wait until Cecily comes of age, and Jack points out that under the terms of her grandfather’s will, Cecily does not legally come of age until she is thirty-five. Lady Bracknell asks Jack to reconsider, and he points out that the matter is entirely in her own hands. As soon as she consents to his marriage to Gwendolen, Cecily can have his consent to marry Algernon. However, Lady Bracknell refuses to entertain the notion. She and Gwendolen are on the point of leaving when Dr. Chasuble arrives and happens to mention Cecily’s governess, Miss Prism. At this, Lady Bracknell starts and asks that Miss Prism be sent for.
When the governess arrives and catches sight of Lady Bracknell, she begins to look guilty and furtive. Lady Bracknell accuses her of having left her sister’s house twenty-eight years before with a baby and never returned. She demands to know where the baby is. Miss Prism confesses she doesn’t know, explaining that she lost the baby, having absentmindedly placed it in a handbag in which she had meant to place the manuscript for a novel she had written. Jack asks what happened to the bag, and Miss Prism says she left it in the cloakroom of a railway station. Jack presses her for further details and goes racing offstage, returning a few moments later with a large handbag. When Miss Prism confirms that the bag is hers, Jack throws himself on her with a cry of “Mother!” It takes a while before the situation is sorted out, but before too long we understand that Jack is not the illegitimate child of Miss Prism but the legitimate child of Lady Bracknell’s sister and, therefore, Algernon’s older brother. Furthermore, Jack had been originally christened “Ernest John.” All these years Jack has unwittingly been telling the truth: Ernest is his name, as is Jack, and he does have an unprincipled younger brother—Algernon. Again the couples embrace, Miss Prism and Dr. Chasuble follow suit, and Jack acknowledges that he now understands “the vital Importance of Being Earnest.”"
Fears,"The play Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? is set on the campus of a small, New England university. It opens with the main characters, George and Martha coming home from a party at her father's house. The two of them clearly care deeply for each other, but events have turned their marriage into a nasty battle between two disenchanted, cynical enemies. Even though the pair arrives home at two o'clock in the morning, they are expecting guests: the new math professor and his wife.
Of course, as it turns out, this new, young professor, Nick, actually works in the biology department. He and his wife, Honey, walk into a brutal social situation. In the first act, ""Fun and Games,"" Martha and George try to fight and humiliate each other in new, inventive ways. As they peel away each other's pretenses and self-respect, George and Martha use Honey and Nick as pawns, transforming their guests into an audience to witness humiliation, into levers for creating jealousy, and into a means for expressing their own sides of their mutual story. In the second act, ""Walpurgisnacht,"" these games get even nastier. The evening turns into a nightmare. George and Martha even attack Honey and Nick, attempting to force them to reveal their dirty secrets and true selves. Finally, in the last act, ""The Exorcism,"" everyone's secrets have been revealed and purged. Honey and Nick go home, leaving Martha and George to try to rebuild their shattered marriage."
Believes,"Beloved begins in 1873 in Cincinnati, Ohio, where Sethe, a former slave, has been living with her eighteen-year-old daughter Denver. Sethe’s mother-in-law, Baby Suggs, lived with them until her death eight years earlier. Just before Baby Suggs’s death, Sethe’s two sons, Howard and Buglar, ran away. Sethe believes they fled because of the malevolent presence of an abusive ghost that has haunted their house at 124 Bluestone Road for years. Denver, however, likes the ghost, which everyone believes to be the spirit of her dead sister.
On the day the novel begins, Paul D, whom Sethe has not seen since they worked together on Mr. Garner’s Sweet Home plantation in Kentucky approximately twenty years earlier, stops by Sethe’s house. His presence resurrects memories that have lain buried in Sethe’s mind for almost two decades. From this point on, the story will unfold on two temporal planes. The present in Cincinnati constitutes one plane, while a series of events that took place around twenty years earlier, mostly in Kentucky, constitutes the other. This latter plane is accessed and described through the fragmented flashbacks of the major characters. Accordingly, we frequently read these flashbacks several times, sometimes from varying perspectives, with each successive narration of an event adding a little more information to the previous ones.
From these fragmented memories, the following story begins to emerge: Sethe, the protagonist, was born in the South to an African mother she never knew. When she is thirteen, she is sold to the Garners, who own Sweet Home and practice a comparatively benevolent kind of slavery. There, the other slaves, who are all men, lust after her but never touch her. Their names are Sixo, Paul D, Paul A, Paul F, and Halle. Sethe chooses to marry Halle, apparently in part because he has proven generous enough to buy his mother’s freedom by hiring himself out on the weekends. Together, Sethe and Halle have two sons, Howard and Buglar, as well as a baby daughter whose name we never learn. When she leaves Sweet Home, Sethe is also pregnant with a fourth child. After the eventual death of the proprietor, Mr. Garner, the widowed Mrs. Garner asks her sadistic, vehemently racist brother-in-law to help her run the farm. He is known to the slaves as schoolteacher, and his oppressive presence makes life on the plantation even more unbearable than it had been before. The slaves decide to run.
Schoolteacher and his nephews anticipate the slaves’ escape, however, and capture Paul D and Sixo. Schoolteacher kills Sixo and brings Paul D back to Sweet Home, where Paul D sees Sethe for what he believes will be the last time. She is still intent on running, having already sent her children ahead to her mother-in-law Baby Suggs’s house in Cincinnati. Invigorated by the recent capture, schoolteacher’s nephews seize Sethe in the barn and violate her, stealing the milk her body is storing for her infant daughter. Unbeknownst to Sethe, Halle is watching the event from a loft above her, where he lies frozen with horror. Afterward, Halle goes mad: Paul D sees him sitting by a churn with butter slathered all over his face. Paul D, meanwhile, is forced to suffer the indignity of wearing an iron bit in his mouth.
When schoolteacher finds out that Sethe has reported his and his nephews’ misdeeds to Mrs. Garner, he has her whipped severely, despite the fact that she is pregnant. Swollen and scarred, Sethe nevertheless runs away, but along the way she collapses from exhaustion in a forest. A white girl, Amy Denver, finds her and nurses her back to health. When Amy later helps Sethe deliver her baby in a boat, Sethe names this second daughter Denver after the girl who helped her. Sethe receives further help from Stamp Paid, who rows her across the Ohio River to Baby Suggs’s house. Baby Suggs cleans Sethe up before allowing her to see her three older children.
Sethe spends twenty-eight wonderful days in Cincinnati, where Baby Suggs serves as an unofficial preacher to the black community. On the last day, however, schoolteacher comes for Sethe to take her and her children back to Sweet Home. Rather than surrender her children to a life of dehumanizing slavery, she flees with them to the woodshed and tries to kill them. Only the third child, her older daughter, dies, her throat having been cut with a handsaw by Sethe. Sethe later arranges for the baby’s headstone to be carved with the word “Beloved.” The sheriff takes Sethe and Denver to jail, but a group of white abolitionists, led by the Bodwins, fights for her release. Sethe returns to the house at 124, where Baby Suggs has sunk into a deep depression. The community shuns the house, and the family continues to live in isolation.
Meanwhile, Paul D has endured torturous experiences in a chain gang in Georgia, where he was sent after trying to kill Brandywine, a slave owner to whom he was sold by schoolteacher. His traumatic experiences have caused him to lock away his memories, emotions, and ability to love in the “tin tobacco box” of his heart. One day, a fortuitous rainstorm allows Paul D and the other chain gang members to escape. He travels northward by following the blossoming spring flowers. Years later, he ends up on Sethe’s porch in Cincinnati.
Paul D’s arrival at 124 commences the series of events taking place in the present time frame. Prior to moving in, Paul D chases the house’s resident ghost away, which makes the already lonely Denver resent him from the start. Sethe and Paul D look forward to a promising future together, until one day, on their way home from a carnival, they encounter a strange young woman sleeping near the steps of 124. Most of the characters believe that the woman—who calls herself Beloved—is the embodied spirit of Sethe’s dead daughter, and the novel provides a wealth of evidence supporting this interpretation. Denver develops an obsessive attachment to Beloved, and Beloved’s attachment to Sethe is equally if not more intense. Paul D and Beloved hate each other, and Beloved controls Paul D by moving him around the house like a rag doll and by seducing him against his will.
When Paul D learns the story of Sethe’s “rough choice”—her infanticide—he leaves 124 and begins sleeping in the basement of the local church. In his absence, Sethe and Beloved’s relationship becomes more intense and exclusive. Beloved grows increasingly abusive, manipulative, and parasitic, and Sethe is obsessed with satisfying Beloved’s demands and making her understand why she murdered her. Worried by the way her mother is wasting away, Denver leaves the premises of 124 for the first time in twelve years in order to seek help from Lady Jones, her former teacher. The community provides the family with food and eventually organizes under the leadership of Ella, a woman who had worked on the Underground Railroad and helped with Sethe’s escape, in order to exorcise Beloved from 124. When they arrive at Sethe’s house, they see Sethe on the porch with Beloved, who stands smiling at them, naked and pregnant. Mr. Bodwin, who has come to 124 to take Denver to her new job, arrives at the house. Mistaking him for schoolteacher, Sethe runs at Mr. Bodwin with an ice pick. She is restrained, but in the confusion Beloved disappears, never to return.
Afterward, Paul D comes back to Sethe, who has retreated to Baby Suggs’s bed to die. Mourning Beloved, Sethe laments, “She was my best thing.” But Paul D replies, “You your best thing, Sethe.” The novel then ends with a warning that “[t]his is not a story to pass on.” The town, and even the residents of 124, have forgotten Beloved “[l]ike an unpleasant dream during a troubling sleep.”"

Bouc has taken the last first class cabin, but arranges to be moved to a separate coach and gives Poirot his space in first class. The first night Poirot sleeps in first class, he observes some strange occurrences. Early in the morning, Poirot is wakened by a cry from Ratchett's compartment next to him. The wagon lit conductor responds knocks on Ratchett's door and a voice from inside responds, ""Ce n'est rien. Je me suis trompe"" (It is nothing. I am mistaken). Poirot has difficulty sleeping because there is a peculiar silence on the train. Mrs. Hubbard rings her bell and tells the conductor a man is in her room. Poirot rings his bell for water and is informed by the conductor that the train is stuck in a snow bank. Poirot hears a loud thump next door.
The next morning, the train still stopped, M. Bouc informs Poirot that Ratchett has been murdered and the murderer is still aboard the train. Poirot tells M. Bouc he will investigate the case. Poirot first examines Ratchett's body and compartment. Ratchett has twelve stab wounds. The window is left open in Ratchett's compartment, presumably to make the investigators think the murderer escaped out the window, but there are no footprints outside the window in the snow. A handkerchief with the initial ""H"" is found in the compartment, a pipe cleaner, a round match different from the matches Ratchett used and a charred piece of paper with the name ""Armstrong"" on it.
The piece of paper with the word Armstrong on it helps Poirot figure out who Ratchett really is and why someone would want to murder him. A few years back, a man named Cassetti kidnapped a three-year old girl, Daisy Armstrong. Cassetti collected a ransom from the wealthy Armstrong family, but killed the child anyways. Poirot concludes that Ratchett is Cassetti.
The interviews start with the Wagon Lit conductor, then Hector McQueen. Poirot knows that McQueen is involved with the case because he knows about the Armstrong note found in Ratchett's compartment, Hector is surprised that Poirot found the note because he thought it had been completely destroyed. He interviews Masterman and then Mrs. Hubbard. Mrs. Hubbard claims that the murderer was in her cabin. All of the passengers give Poirot suitable alibis during their interviews, although a few suspicious elements are brought to light: many passengers observed a woman in a red kimono walking down the hallway the night of the murder, but no one admits they have a red kimono. Mrs. Hubbard tells Poirot she had Greta Ohlsson lock the communicating door between she and Ratchett. Hildegarde Schmidt bumped into a stranger wearing a Wagon Lit jacket.
Poirot checks every passenger's luggage. During the check he notices a few interesting things: the label on Countess Andrenyi's luggage is wet, a Wagon Lit uniform is found in Hildegarde Schmidt's bag and, lastly, the red kimono is found in Poirot's own luggage.
After the luggage check, Poirot, Dr. Constantine and M. Bouc review the facts of the case and develop a list of questions. With the evidence and questions in mind, Poirot sits and thinks about the case. When he surfaces from a somewhat trance-like state, Poirot has discovered the solution to the case. Before he reveals this solution in full, he calls in several people and reveals their true identities. Poirot discovers Countess Andrenyi is Helena Goldenberg, aunt of Daisy Armstrong. She wet her luggage label and obscured her name, in an effort to conceal her identity. Also, Mary Debenham was Daisy's governess, Antonio Foscanelli was the Armstrong's chaffer, Masterman the valet, and Greta Ohlsson was Daisy Armstrong's nurse. Princess Dragomiroff claims her handkerchief from Poirot, the same found in Ratchett's compartment.
Poirot gathers all of the passengers into the dining car and propounds two possible solutions. The fist solution is that a stranger entered the train at Vincovci and killed Ratchett. The second solution is that all of the passengers aboard the Orient Express were involved with the murder. He argues that twelve of the thirteen passengers, all close to the Armstrong case, killed Ratchett to avenge the murder of Daisy Armstrong. Mrs. Hubbard, revealed as Linda Arden, admits that the second solution is correct. Poirot suggests that M. Bouc and Dr. Constantine tell the police that the first solution is correct to protect the family. M. Bouc and Dr. Constantine accept Poirot's suggestion."
Grim,"Max, who narrates this story in the first person, tells the reader that before he met Freak, he didn’t have a brain. This, he says, is “the unvanquished truth.”
Max first meets Freak, or Kevin, at daycare, the year that Max moves in with Grim and Gram, his mother’s parents. Freak uses crutches and calls himself “Robot Man.” One day, Freak leaves daycare and doesn’t return.
Max resumes the story in the summer before eighth grade. Grim, Max’s grandfather, worries that Max is beginning to look like Him, Max’s father. Max tells us he is L.D., learning disabled, and he doesn’t think he has much going on in his brain. One day, Max is in the backyard. He recognizes a woman moving items into a house down the block as Freak’s mom, and then sees Freak himself. Max is curious and he approaches the house. Freak asks the “earthling” (Max) to identify himself. Max runs back to his basement. He emerges later to find Freak trying to retrieve an object stuck high in a tree. Max helps him and they spend the afternoon together. Freak’s mom, who Max knows as “Fair Gwen of Air”, invites Max to dinner. Max learns that Gwen and his mom were friends years ago. 
Max and Freak go the Fourth of July fireworks show by the millpond together. Max hoists Freak onto his shoulders so that Freak can see. When the show ends, Tony D. (known as Blade) and his gang corner Max and Freak. With Freak steering Max by kicking him right or left, they run straight into the millpond, where Max becomes stuck in the mud. Blade and his followers throw rocks at them from the shore. The police arrive and rescue Max and Freak. One of the cops seems to recognize Max as the son of someone he calls “Killer Kane,” and asks if his dad is still in prison. Freak interrupts him and says, “We’re Freak the Mighty, that’s who we are.” 
Freak the Mighty spend the summer going on quests. On these quests, Freak uses words Max doesn’t understand and insists that Max look them up in the dictionary Freak always carries. Max pretends to understand.
One day, Max and Freak walk to the “Medical Research” facility where Freak says they have an Experimental Bionics Unit. Freak tells Max that he visits there every few months to be fitted for a bionic transplant. Max thinks such a procedure will be painful and dangerous, but Freak says that pain is a state of mind and life itself is dangerous.
The two boys embark on a nighttime quest to retrieve a purse that Blade and his gang tossed down a storm drain. The purse is empty except for an ID card with the address of a Loretta Lee on it. The next day, Max and Freak walk to an area of rundown apartment buildings called the Testaments. Loretta and a man named Iggy live at the address, and they both know Max’s father, Kenny Kane. Iggy says that Max is a “ringer” for his dad, Killer Kane. Loretta remembers that Freak is Gwen’s son. Iggy kicks the boys out and they run home.
The school year begins, and Max finds himself in the same class as Freak. Classmates yell slurs at him. Suddenly, Freak climbs onto Max’s shoulders and directs Max to walk around the room. “Freak the Mighty, Freak the Mighty!” he shouts. Soon the whole class is chanting. Freak the Mighty end up in the principal’s office. 
Friday the thirteenth in October comes and it’s a bad one. First, Max’s dad wants Max to write a letter to the parole board on his behalf. Max has a panic attack. Second, a medical emergency sends Freak to the hospital. His insides are growing but his outside isn’t.
As Christmas approaches, Grim tells Max that his dad is out on parole. Freak and Fair Gwen, Max, Grim and Gram spend Christmas Eve together. Freak gives Max a dictionary that he has written, filled with his favorite words. The best gift ever, Max thinks.
After the Christmas Eve festivities, Max’s father sneaks into the basement. He kidnaps Max, and they end up at Loretta and Iggy’s place. Kenny ties up Max in a vacant apartment and swears on a Bible that he did not murder Max’s mother. 
Iggy reports that Freak has sent the cops to look for them. Kenny escapes with Max to an abandoned building where he gags and ties Max up. When Kenny leaves, Loretta appears and works to free Max. No sooner is Max untied, than Kenny returns, and grabs Loretta to choke her. Max tries to stop him, yelling that he saw Kenny kill his mother. Kane lets go of Loretta and grabs Max’s neck. Seconds later, Freak appears with a squirt gun supposedly filled with sulfuric acid, which he sprays at Kenny’s eyes. Max and Freak escape, the cops arrest Kenny and save Loretta. Freak laughs because the squirt gun – filled in fact with soap, vinegar, and curry powder – worked. As Gwen arrives and carries Freak away, he yells, “Freak the Mighty strikes again!” 
The school year continues. Gwen warns Kevin that he has to be “extra careful.” He’s been having trouble breathing. Max awaits his father’s trial and is relieved when Killer Kane pleads guilty because he won’t have to testify. 
Freak, Fair Gwen, Grim, Gram, and Max celebrate Freak’s thirteenth birthday. Suddenly, Freak has a seizure and is rushed to the hospital. 
The doctors make an exception and allow Max to visit when Freak asks for him. Freak tells Max that he won’t be coming home looking the way he looks now, and that he’s having a special operation. He gives Max a gift of a blank book and tells Max to write in it, to tell the story of Freak the Mighty.
When Max arrives back at the hospital the next day, Freak has passed away. The doctor explains that his heart just got too big for his body. 
For a long time, Max does not come out of the basement. When he eventually does, he runs into Loretta Lee, who asks what he’s been doing. When he says, “Nothing,” Loretta tells him, “Nothing is a drag, kid. Think about it.” That night, Max takes out the blank book and starts writing “the unvanquished truth.” He finishes the story and feels good about having written a book. Max thinks maybe he’ll even read a book now."
Enemy,"The town in which the play is set has built a huge bathing complex that is crucial to the town's economy. Dr. Stockmann has just discovered that the baths' drainage system is seriously contaminated. He alerts several members of the community, including Hovstad and Aslaksen, and receives generous support and thanks for making his discovery in time to save the town. The next morning, however, his brother, who is also the town's mayor, tells him that he must retract his statements, for the necessary repairs would be too expensive; additionally, the mayor is not convinced by Dr. Stockmann's findings. The brothers have a fierce argument, but Dr. Stockmann hopes that at least Hovstad's newspaper will support him. However, the mayor convinces Hovstad and Aslaksen to oppose Dr. Stockmann.
The doctor holds a town meeting to give a lecture on the baths, but Aslaksen and the mayor try to keep him from speaking. Dr. Stockmann then begins a long tirade in which he condemns the foundations of the town and the tyranny of the majority. The audience finds his speech incredibly offensive, and the next morning the doctor's home is vandalized. He and his daughter are fired. The mayor insinuates that the doctor's actions were merely a scheme to inherit more of Morten Kiil's money, and Kiil himself soon arrives to suggest just such a plan to Dr. Stockmann. However, the doctor refuses all such suggestions and decides to defy authority and remain in town. His family is supportive, and he says that the strongest man is the man who stands alone."
Disciplined,"Lawyer Bryan Stevenson gives a first-person account of his decades helping marginalized Americans who have been unfairly and harshly punished by the U.S. criminal justice system, which disproportionately targets people of color and poor people. At the heart of Just Mercy is the story of Walter McMillian, a Black man who was framed for the murder of a girl named Ronda Morrison, convicted, and sent to death row. 
Stevenson alternates chapters about Walter with his personal reflections on our country’s history with racial disparity and issues around incarceration. Stevenson highlights other groups of vulnerable people who have been victimized by the criminal justice system and shares the stories of the prisoners he has helped over the years. The book also follows the growth of Stevenson’s nonprofit law project, the Alabama-based Equal Justice Initiative (EJI), through its expansion from focusing on death row prisoners to helping people sentenced to life without parole. Stevenson chronicles how EJI becomes a significant force in criminal justice reform.
In 1983 as a law student, Stevenson discovers his life’s passion when he interns with the Georgia-based Southern Prisoners Defense Committee and meets his first death row prisoner. After graduation Stevenson accepts a job with the organization to represent poor prisoners, including those in Alabama who lack any public defender. He meets Walter McMillian on Alabama’s death row. Walter owns a successful business but also transgresses racial boundaries when he has an affair with a white woman. Soon after the affair becomes public, the woman’s friend, Ralph Myers, accuses Walter of committing the unsolved murder of Ronda Morrison, which has outraged the community. Law enforcement, including a racist sheriff and the district attorney, eagerly pounces on this accusation, overlooking Walter’s alibi and a lack of evidence. Instead, they actively force Ralph to stick with his story even when he tries to recant. They coerce other false witness testimonies, and—as revealed years later—actively suppress evidence.
After Stevenson and the team at EJI unsuccessfully appeal Walter’s conviction, they launch their own investigation of the crime and uncover new evidence. They find witnesses who can prove the witnesses against Walter lied as well as financial records that indicate that one of these witnesses was paid to give false testimony. Stevenson and his team also petition for and receive all records from Walter’s trial. However, their big break comes when they receive a phone call from Ralph, who now wants to make amends. Ralph admits to lying about Walter and says he was threatened by law enforcement. Stevenson wins a hearing for Walter where he can present his new evidence: Ralph’s testimony, which is confirmed by health care workers and other inmates, as well as recordings of the law enforcement team threatening Ralph if he doesn’t frame Walter. 
While the judge refuses to grant Walter relief, Stevenson continues the appeal process through the Alabama courts. The district attorney asks outside agents to investigate the murder for which Walter was convicted, and the investigators determine that Walter had nothing to do with the crime. Six weeks later, the court invalidates Walter’s conviction. Stevenson and the State file a joint motion to dismiss the charges, and Walter is set free.
Throughout the process, Stevenson and Walter become close friends, and Stevenson helps Walter upon his release, including filing a civil suit on his behalf and offering him a place to stay. Walter works with Stevenson to share his story, giving interviews and speaking at legal conferences, and Walter is even featured in a documentary. Unfortunately, Walter is diagnosed with advancing dementia and is forced to rely on family and eventually a nursing facility for his care. He dies in 2013. Stevenson gives a eulogy at his funeral and shares all he learned from Walter, particularly that we must extend mercy to everyone, even those who have not earned it.
Interspersed with chapters chronicling Walter’s narrative are stories of Stevenson’s other clients and work. His closeness with these prisoners and their horrifying circumstances makes Stevenson more determined to help and causes him to reflect on abstract issues that nevertheless imbue the criminal justice system, like humanity and mercy. Stevenson focuses on several categories of vulnerable people who become trapped in the system, including mentally ill prisoners, disabled prisoners, and poor women who give birth to stillborn babies. 
Stevenson and his team at EJI also become increasingly focused on juvenile offenders who are sometimes tried as adults despite their young age. These offenders may be given de facto death sentences by being sentenced to life without parole and face perilous circumstances when they are housed in adult prisons. Stevenson illustrates how these prisoners retain their own humanity while being forced to live under inhumane conditions. He also discusses some of the qualities common among these types of prisoners: They are generally poor and disproportionately people of color, and most of them lack adequate legal counsel. The juveniles have horrific backgrounds of abuse and neglect.
Stevenson and his team at EJI also work to change the legal system to offer more protection to marginalized people. Several of his cases end up before the U.S. Supreme Court, and he succeeds in winning rulings that ban as unconstitutional the conviction of children to life without parole and the execution of people deemed incompetent from dementia or neurological disease. EJI works to raise public awareness of issues surrounding unfair incarceration, produces groundbreaking reports on racial issues, and sets up programs to help formerly incarcerated people adjust to life on the outside.
Stevenson also reflects on the issues that surround the criminal justice system. His time spent with prisoners awaiting their execution makes him realize how inhumane it is to prepare another human to die. After decades of work, when Stevenson fails to prevent the execution of a man who suffers from an intellectual disability, he momentarily feels unable to continue his work. However, he realizes that he cannot help but be broken by his experiences and comes to understand that it is his own brokenness that allows him to more fully understand the need for mercy and to bring compassion to others. The book ends with Stevenson’s renewed commitment to helping others."
Combat,"All Quiet on the Western Front is narrated by Paul Bäumer, a young man of nineteen who fights in the German army on the French front in World War I. Paul and several of his friends from school joined the army voluntarily after listening to the stirring patriotic speeches of their teacher, Kantorek. But after experiencing ten weeks of brutal training at the hands of the petty, cruel Corporal Himmelstoss and the unimaginable brutality of life on the front, Paul and his friends have realized that the ideals of nationalism and patriotism for which they enlisted are simply empty clichés. They no longer believe that war is glorious or honorable, and they live in constant physical terror.
When Paul’s company receives a short reprieve after two weeks of fighting, only eighty men of the original 150-man company return from the front. The cook doesn’t want to give the survivors the rations that were meant for the dead men but eventually agrees to do so; the men thus enjoy a large meal. Paul and his friends visit Kemmerich, a former classmate who has recently had a leg amputated after contracting gangrene. Kemmerich is slowly dying, and Müller, another former classmate, wants Kemmerich’s boots for himself. Paul doesn’t consider Müller insensitive; like the other soldiers, Müller simply realizes pragmatically that Kemmerich no longer needs his boots. Surviving the agony of war, Paul observes, forces one to learn to disconnect oneself from emotions like grief, sympathy, and fear. Not long after this encounter, Paul returns to Kemmerich’s bedside just as the young man dies. At Kemmerich’s request, Paul takes his boots to Müller.
A group of new recruits comes to reinforce the company, and Paul’s friend Kat produces a beef and bean stew that impresses them. Kat says that if all the men in an army, including the officers, were paid the same wage and given the same food, wars would be over immediately. Kropp, another of Paul’s former classmates, says that there should be no armies; he argues that a nation’s leaders should instead fight out their disagreements with clubs. They discuss the fact that petty, insignificant people become powerful and arrogant during war, and Tjaden, a member of Paul’s company, announces that the cruel Corporal Himmelstoss has come to fight at the front.
At night, the men go on a harrowing mission to lay barbed wire at the front. Pounded by artillery, they hide in a graveyard, where the force of the shelling causes the buried corpses to emerge from their graves, as groups of living men fall dead around them. After this gruesome event, the surviving soldiers return to their camp, where they kill lice and think about what they will do at the end of the war. Some of the men have tentative plans, but all of them seem to feel that the war will never end. Paul fears that if the war did end, he wouldn’t know what to do with himself. Himmelstoss arrives at the front; when the men see him, Tjaden insults him. The men’s lieutenant gives them light punishment but also lectures Himmelstoss about the futility of saluting at the front. Paul and Kat find a house with a goose and roast the goose for supper, enjoying a rare good meal.
The company is caught in a bloody battle with a charging group of Allied infantrymen. Men are blown apart, limbs are severed from torsos, and giant rats pick at the dead and the wounded. Paul feels that he must become an animal in battle, trusting only his instincts to keep him alive. After the battle, only thirty-two of eighty men are still alive. The men are given a short reprieve at a field depot. Paul and some of his friends go for a swim, which ends in a rendezvous with a group of French girls. Paul desperately wishes to recapture his innocence with a girl, but he feels that it is impossible to do so.
Paul receives seventeen days of leave and goes home to see his family. He feels awkward and oppressed in his hometown, unable to discuss his traumatic experiences with anyone. He learns that his mother is dying of cancer and that Kantorek has been conscripted as a soldier, from which he derives a certain cold satisfaction. He visits Kemmerich’s mother and tells her, untruthfully, that her son’s death was instant and painless. At the end of his leave, Paul spends some time at a training camp near a group of Russian prisoners-of-war. Paul feels that the Russians are people just like him, not subhuman enemies, and wonders how war can make enemies of people who have no grudge against one another.
Paul is sent back to his company and is reunited with his friends. The kaiser, the German emperor, pays a visit to the front, and the men are disappointed to see that he is merely a short man with a weak voice. In battle, Paul is separated from his company and forced to hide in a shell hole. A French soldier jumps into the shell hole with him, and Paul instinctively stabs him. As the man dies a slow, painful death, Paul is overcome with remorse for having hurt him. He feels again that this enemy soldier is no enemy at all but rather a victim of war just like himself. Paul looks through the soldier’s things and finds that his name was Gérard Duval and learns that Duval had a wife and child at home. When he returns to his company, Paul recounts the incident to his friends, who try to console him.
Paul and his friends are given an easy assignment: for three weeks, they are to guard a supply depot away from the fighting. When the next battle takes place, Paul and Kropp are wounded and forced to bribe a sergeant-major with cigars in order to be placed on the hospital train together. At the hospital, Paul undergoes surgery. Kropp’s leg is amputated, and he becomes extremely depressed. After his surgery, Paul has a short leave at home before he returns to his company.
As the German army begins to give in to the unrelenting pressure of the Allied forces, Paul’s friends are killed in combat one by one. Detering, one of Paul’s close friends, attempts to desert but is caught and court-martialed. Kat is killed when a piece of shrapnel slices his head open while Paul is carrying him to safety. By the fall of 1918, Paul is the only one of his circle of friends who is still alive. Soldiers everywhere whisper that the Germans will soon surrender and that peace will come. Paul is poisoned in a gas attack and given a short leave. He reflects that, when the war ends, he will be ruined for peacetime; all he knows is the war. In October 1918, on a day with very little fighting, Paul is killed. The army report for that day reads simply: “All quiet on the Western Front.” Paul’s corpse wears a calm expression, as though relieved that the end has come at last."
Affliction,"Seventeen-year-old Hazel Grace Lancaster reluctantly attends a cancer patients' support group at her mother’s behest. Because of her cancer, she uses a portable oxygen tank to breathe properly. In one of the meetings she catches the eye of a teenage boy, and through the course of the meeting she learns the boy’s name is Augustus Waters. He's there to support their mutual friend, Isaac. Isaac had a tumor in one eye that he had removed, and now he has to have his other eye taken out as well. After the meeting ends, Augustus approaches Hazel and tells her she looks like Natalie Portman in V for Vendetta. He invites Hazel to his house to watch the movie, and while hanging out, the two discuss their experiences with cancer. Hazel reveals she has thyroid cancer that has spread to her lungs. Augustus had osteosarcoma, but he is now cancer free after having his leg amputated. Before Augustus takes Hazel home, they agree to read one another’s favorite novels. Augustus gives Hazel The Price of Dawn, and Hazel recommends An Imperial Affliction.
Hazel explains the magnificence of An Imperial Affliction: It is a novel about a girl named Anna who has cancer, and it's the only account she's read of living with cancer that matches her experience. She describes how the novel maddeningly ends midsentence, denying the reader closure about the fate of the novel’s characters. She speculates about the novel’s mysterious author, Peter Van Houten, who fled to Amsterdam after the novel was published and hasn’t been heard from since.
A week after Hazel and Augustus discuss the literary meaning of An Imperial Affliction, Augustus miraculously reveals he tracked down Van Houten's assistant, Lidewij, and through her he's managed to start an email correspondence with the reclusive author. He shares Van Houten's letter with Hazel, and she devises a list of questions to send Van Houten, hoping to clear up the novel’s ambiguous conclusion. Hazel is most concerned with the fate of Anna’s mother. She figures that if Anna’s mother survives her daughter’s death, then her own parents will be alright after Hazel dies. Van Houten eventually replies, saying he could only answer Hazel’s questions in person. He invites her to stop by if she is ever in Amsterdam.
Shortly after Augustus invites Hazel on a picnic. It turns out he's planned an elaborate Dutch-themed picnic where he reveals that a charitable foundation that grants the wishes of kids with cancer has agreed to grant his: he's taking the two of them to Amsterdam to meet Van Houten. She is thrilled, but when he touches her face she feels hesitant for some reason. Over time she realizes that she likes him a lot, but she knows she'll hurt him when she dies. She compares herself to a grenade.
In the midst of her struggle over what to do about Augustus, Hazel suffers a serious episode in which her lungs fill with fluid and she goes to the ICU. When she is released after a period of days, she learns that Augustus never left the hospital’s waiting room. He delivers Hazel another letter from Van Houten, this one more personal and more cryptic than the last. After reading the letter, Hazel is more determined than ever to go to Amsterdam. There is a problem though: Her parents and her team of doctors don’t think Hazel is strong enough to travel. The situation seems hopeless until one of the physicians most familiar with her case, Dr. Maria, convinces Hazel’s parents that Hazel must travel because she needs to live her life.
The plans are made for Augustus, Hazel, and Hazel's mother to go to Amsterdam, but when Hazel and Augustus meet Van Houten they find that, instead of a prolific genius, he is a mean-spirited drunk who claims he cannot answer any of Hazel’s questions. The two leave Van Houten’s in utter disappointment, and accompanied by Lidewij, who feels horrified by Van Houten's behavior, they tour Anne Frank’s house. At the end of the tour, Augustus and Hazel share a romantic kiss, to the applause of spectators. They head back to the hotel where they make love for the first and only time. The following day, Augustus confesses that while Hazel was in the ICU he had a body scan which revealed his cancer has returned and spread everywhere. They return to Indianapolis, and Hazel realizes Augustus is now the grenade. As his condition worsens he is less prone to his typical charm and confidence. He becomes vulnerable and scared, but is still a beautiful boy in Hazel’s mind. As this change occurs, she ceases calling him Augustus and starts referring to him as just Gus, as his parents do. Hazel recognizes that she loves him now as much as ever. Augustus’s condition deteriorates quickly. In his final days Augustus arranges a prefuneral for himself, and Isaac and Hazel give eulogies. Hazel steals a line from Van Houten about larger and smaller infinities. She says how much she loves Augustus, and that she would not trade their short time together for anything in the world.
Augustus dies eight days later. Hazel is astonished to find Van Houten at the funeral. Van Houten explains that he and Gus maintained correspondence and that Augustus demanded Van Houten make up for ruining the trip to Amsterdam by coming to his funeral to see Hazel. Van Houten abstractly reveals the fate of Anna’s mother, but Hazel is not interested. A few days later Isaac informs Hazel that Augustus was writing something for her. He had hinted about writing a sequel to An Imperial Affliction for her, and as Hazel scrambles to locate the pages she encounters Van Houten once more. He drunkenly reveals that Anna was the name of his daughter. She died of cancer when she was eight, and An Imperial Affliction was his literary attempt at reconciling himself with her death. Hazel tells Van Houten to sober up and write another book.
Eventually Hazel learns that Augustus sent the pages to Van Houten because he wanted Van Houten to use the pages to compose a well-written eulogy about Hazel. Lidewij forces Van Houten to read the pages and sends them straight off to Hazel. The novel concludes with Hazel reading Augustus’s words. He says getting hurt in this world is inevitable, but we do get to choose who we allow to hurt us, and that he his happy with his choice. He hopes she likes her choice too. The final words of the novel come from Hazel, who says she does."
Cook,"Matilda Cook is a fourteen-year-old girl living in Philadelphia in 1793. Matilda’s mother, Lucille, manages the coffeehouse, and they live above the shop with Grandfather, Matilda’s deceased father’s father, who fought in the war. Matilda dreams of one day owning her own shops and traveling to Paris, but for now she helps Mother in the coffeehouse, where she is often berated for being too slow or too lazy. The coffeehouse’s cook, Eliza, is a formerly enslaved Black woman whose husband died before she could buy him his freedom. Matilda and her family also have a serving girl, Polly, who was Matilda’s childhood friend. One day, Polly fails show up at the coffeehouse. Mother goes to see where Polly is and comes back with news that Polly died from a sudden fever. Matilda feels very sad and asks to see Polly’s family or go to her funeral, but Mother doesn’t want Matilda going anywhere near a house that could contain sick people.
As Matilda serves the customers in the coffeehouse, she hears them talking about a new disease spreading around the city, and some believe it is yellow fever. More and more people continue to catch the disease and die. Mother considers sending Matilda to the Ludington family’s farm, where she will be farther away from the disease, but Matilda doesn’t want to leave. However, not long after, Mother becomes ill with the fever and insists that Matilda leave her so that she will not get sick as well. Matilda and Grandfather leave Philadelphia with a farmer and his wife to go to the Ludington farm. Grandfather begins coughing on the journey and blames it on the heat. But when the wagon is stopped by several men who are monitoring who goes in and out of the local town, the men hear Grandfather’s coughing and refuse to let him pass. The farmer leaves Grandfather and Matilda behind on the road several miles outside Philadelphia.
Matilda and Grandfather rest in the shade of a tree while Matilda thinks about what to do next. She gathers water for them to drink at a stream and collects berries for them to eat. Grandfather seems weak and at times disoriented but does not show any signs of yellow fever. After trying to find food from local farmers, Matilda returns to Grandfather and collapses. She wakes up several days later in a hospital and learns that she has yellow fever, but Grandfather does not. He explains that his recent cough was caused by heart problems. While Matilda recovers, a clerk tells her that she should go live at the orphan house since she cannot find Mother, but Grandfather protests, insisting that he’ll take care of Matilda.
Once Matilda is fully recovered, she and Grandfather return to Philadelphia. They find that the city has changed very much since they departed. Many businesses have closed. Empty houses are boarded up to prevent thieves from breaking in. When Grandfather and Matilda return to their coffeehouse, they see that it has been broken into and all of their food and several possessions have been stolen. Matilda finds some food in the withered garden and cares for Grandfather. One night, two men break into the house while Matilda is sleeping on the first floor. Matilda hides, but the men soon realize she’s there. They trap her and try to make her tell them where she’s hidden her money. Woken by the noise, Grandfather comes downstairs with his rifle and shoots. One of the men attacks Grandfather, but Matilda stabs the man in the shoulder with Grandfather’s sword, which the men had planned to steal. The men leave when Matilda threatens to kill them. Grandfather, who was knocked back by the shot of the rifle and who has already been having heart troubles, dies. Matilda brings his body outside to be buried in a mass grave the next day.
On her way home from overseeing Grandfather’s burial, Matilda sees a young girl crying. She learns that the girl’s name is Nell and that Nell’s mother is dead. While trying to find someone to take in Nell, Matilda sees Eliza in the distance and follows her until she catches up. Eliza allows Matilda and Nell to stay with her and her brother Joseph’s family. Matilda becomes attached to Nell but knows she’s not ready to take care of a child, so Matilda brings Nell to the orphan house. However, after the woman at the orphan house says they can’t take in any more children, Matilda brings Nell back to Eliza’s brother’s house, secretly relieved.
Matilda begins helping Eliza with her volunteer work for the Free African Society, caring for patients with yellow fever. One day, Matilda and Eliza return home to find that Joseph’s sons and Nell have the fever. Knowing the children need to get out of the heat to survive, Matilda and Eliza bring the children to the coffeehouse, where it is cooler. The first frost soon arrives, an event that people believe will bring an end to the epidemic. The children eventually recover.
After the epidemic ends, Matilda reopens the coffeehouse with Eliza as her partner and begins spending more time with a local painter’s apprentice, Nathaniel Benson. One day, Nathaniel comes in the coffeehouse to announce that President Washington has returned to Philadelphia. Everyone rushes outside to catch a glimpse of the president. On their way back to the coffeehouse, a carriage arrives and Matilda’s mother steps out. Mother left for the Ludington farm shortly after Matilda and Grandfather did and tried to track them down when she realized they were not there, which only made her weaker. She recovered at the Ludingtons’ and returned to Philadelphia as soon as she could. With Mother needing more rest than before, Matilda continues running the coffeehouse and caring for Nell as the city moves on from the epidemic."
Wide,"Antoinette's story begins when she is a young girl in early nineteenth- century Jamaica. The white daughter of ex-slave owners, she lives on a run-down plantation called Coulibri Estate. Five years have passed since her father, Mr. Cosway, reportedly drunk himself to death, his finances in ruins after the passage of the Emancipation Act of 1833, which freed Black enslaved people and led to the demise of many white slave owners. Throughout Antoinette's childhood, hostility flares between the crumbling white aristocracy and the impoverished servants they employ.
As a young girl, Antoinette lives at Coulibri Estate with her widowed mother, Annette, her sickly younger brother, Pierre, and gossiping servants who seem particularly attuned to their employers' misfortune and social disrepute. Antoinette spends her days in isolation. Her mother, a beautiful young woman who is ostracized by the Jamaican elite, spends little time with her, choosing to pace listlessly on the house's glacis (the covered balcony) instead of nurturing her child. Antoinette's only companion, Tia, the daughter of a servant, turns against her unexpectedly.
One day, Antoinette is surprised to find a group of elegant visitors calling on her mother from Spanish Town, the island's version of a sophisticated metropolis. Among them is an English man named Mr. Mason who, after a short courtship, asks for Annette's hand in marriage. When Mr. Mason and Annette honeymoon in Trinidad, Antoinette and Pierre stay with their Aunt Cora in Spanish Town.
In the interim, Mr. Mason has had the estate repaired and restored to it to its former grandeur, and has bought new servants. Discontent, however, is rising among the freed Black people, who protest one night outside the house. Bearing torches, they accidentally set the house on fire, and Pierre is badly hurt. As the family flees the house, Antoinette runs desperately towards Tia and her mother. Tia throws a jagged rock at Antoinette, cutting her forehead and drawing blood.
The events of the night leave Antoinette dangerously ill for six weeks. She wakes to find herself in Aunt Cora's care. Pierre has died. Annette's madness, which has revealed itself gradually over the years, has fully surfaced after the trauma of the fire. When Antoinette visits her mother, who has been placed in the care of a Black couple, she hardly recognizes the ghostlike figure she encounters. When Antoinette approaches, Annette violently flings her away.
Antoinette then enrolls in convent school along with other young Creole girls. For several years, she lives at the school with the nuns, learning everything from proper ladylike deportment to the tortured histories of female saints. Antoinette's family has all but deserted her: Aunt Cora has moved to England for a year, while Mr. Mason travels for months away from Jamaica, visiting only occasionally.
When Antoinette is seventeen, Mr. Mason announces on his visit that friends from England will be coming the following winter. He means to present Antoinette into society as a cultivated woman, fit for marriage. At this point, the end of Part One, Antoinette's narration becomes increasingly muddled, jumping from present- tense descriptions of her life in the convent to muddled recollections of past events.
Antoinette's husband, an Englishman who remains nameless, narrates Part Two. After a wedding ceremony in Spanish Town, he and Antoinette honeymoon on one of the Windward Islands, at an estate that once belonged to Antoinette's mother. He begins to have misgivings about the marriage as they approach a town ominously called Massacre. He knows little of his new wife, having agreed to marry her days before, when Mr. Mason's son, Richard Mason, offered him £30,000 if he proposed. Desperate for money, he agreed to the marriage.
When the couple arrives at Granbois, Antoinette's inherited estate, the man feels increasingly uncomfortable around the servants and his strange young wife. Hostility grows between the man and Christophine, Antoinette's surrogate mother and a servant who wields great power in the house. The man soon receives a menacing letter from Daniel Cosway, one of old Cosway's illegitimate children. Venomous in tone, letter warns of Antoinette's depravity, saying that she comes from a family of derelicts and has madness in her blood. After reading this letter, the man begins to detect signs of Antoinette's insanity.
Antoinette, sensing that her husband hates her, asks Christophine for a magic love potion. Christophine grudgingly agrees. That night, when the man confronts Antoinette about her past, they argue passionately. He awakes the next morning believing he has been poisoned, and he later sleeps with the servant girl, Amelie, who helps him recover. Sitting in the next room, Antoinette hears everything.
The next morning, Antoinette leaves for Christophine's. When she returns, she seems to be totally mad. Drunk and raving, she pleads with the man to stop calling her ""Bertha,"" a name he has given her without explanation. Antoinette then bites her husband's arm, drawing blood. After she collapses and falls in bed, Christophine rails at him for his cruelty. That night, he decides to leave Jamaica with Antoinette.
Antoinette narrates Part Three from England, where she is locked away in a garret room in her husband's house, under the watch of a servant, Grace Poole. A hidden captive, Antoinette has no sense of time or place; she does not even believe she is in England when Grace tells her so. Violent and frenzied, Antoinette draws a knife on her stepbrother, Richard Mason, when he visits her. Later she has no memory of the incident. Antoinette has a recurring dream about taking Grace's keys and exploring the house's downstairs quarters. In this dream, she lights candles and sets the house ablaze. One night, she wakes from this dream and feels she must act on it. The novel ends with Antoinette holding a candle and walking down from her upstairs prison."
Partially,"The Joy Luck Club contains sixteen interwoven stories about conflicts between Chinese immigrant mothers and their American-raised daughters. The book hinges on Jing-mei’s trip to China to meet her half-sisters, twins Chwun Yu and Chwun Hwa. The half-sisters remained behind in China because Jing-mei’s mother, Suyuan, was forced to leave them on the roadside during her desperate flight from Japan’s invasion of Kweilin during World War II. Jing-mei was born to a different father years later, in America. Suyuan intended to return to China for her other daughters, but failed to find them before her death.
Jing-mei has taken her mother’s place playing mahjong in a weekly gathering her mother had organized in China and revived in San Francisco: the Joy Luck Club. The club’s other members—Lindo, Ying-ying, and An-mei—are three of her mother’s oldest friends and fellow immigrants. They tell Jing-mei that just before Suyuan died, she had finally succeeded in locating the address of her lost daughters. The three women repeatedly urge Jing-mei to travel to China and tell her sisters about their mother’s life. But Jing-mei wonders whether she is capable of telling her mother’s story, and the three older women fear that Jing-mei’s doubts may be justified. They fear that their own daughters, like Jing-mei, may not know or appreciate the stories of their mothers’ lives.
The novel is composed of four sections, each of which contains four separate narratives. In the first four stories of the book, the mothers, speaking in turn, recall with astonishing clarity their relationships with their own mothers, and they worry that their daughters’ recollections of them will never possess the same intensity. In the second section, these daughters—Waverly, Jing-mei, Lena, and Rose—relate their recollections of their childhood relationships with their mothers; the great lucidity and force with which they tell their stories proves their mothers’ fears at least partially unfounded. In the third group of stories, the four daughters narrate their adult dilemmas—troubles in marriage and with their careers. Although they believe that their mothers’ antiquated ideas do not pertain to their own very American lifestyles, their search for solutions inevitably brings them back to their relationships with the older generation. In the final group of stories, the mothers struggle to offer solutions and support to their daughters, in the process learning more about themselves. Lindo recognizes through her daughter Waverly that she has been irrevocably changed by American culture. Ying-ying realizes that Lena has unwittingly followed her passive example in her marriage to Harold Livotny. An-mei realizes that Rose has not completely understood the lessons she intended to teach her about faith and hope.
Although Jing-mei fears that she cannot adequately portray her mother’s life, Suyuan’s story permeates the novel via Jing-mei’s voice: she speaks for Suyuan in the first and fourth sections, the two “mothers’ sections,” of the novel. Suyuan’s story is representative of the struggle to maintain the mother-daughter bond across cultural and generational gaps; by telling this story as her mother’s daughter, Jing-mei enacts and cements the very bond that is the subject of Suyuan’s story. When Jing-mei finally travels to China and helps her half-sisters to know a mother they cannot remember, she forges two other mother-daughter bonds as well. Her journey represents a reconciliation between Suyuan’s two lives, between two cultures, and between mother and daughter. This enables Jing-mei to bring closure and resolution to her mother’s story, but also to her own. In addition, the journey brings hope to the other members of the Joy Luck Club that they too can reconcile the oppositions in their lives between past and present, between cultures, and between generations."
Hoping,"Two men, Vladimir and Estragon, meet near a tree. They converse on various topics and reveal that they are waiting there for a man named Godot. While they wait, two other men enter. Pozzo is on his way to the market to sell his slave, Lucky. He pauses for a while to converse with Vladimir and Estragon. Lucky entertains them by dancing and thinking, and Pozzo and Lucky leave.
After Pozzo and Lucky leave, a boy enters and tells Vladimir that he is a messenger from Godot. He tells Vladimir that Godot will not be coming tonight, but that he will surely come tomorrow. Vladimir asks him some questions about Godot and the boy departs. After his departure, Vladimir and Estragon decide to leave, but they do not move as the curtain falls.
The next night, Vladimir and Estragon again meet near the tree to wait for Godot. Lucky and Pozzo enter again, but this time Pozzo is blind and Lucky is dumb. Pozzo does not remember meeting the two men the night before. They leave and Vladimir and Estragon continue to wait.
Shortly after, the boy enters and once again tells Vladimir that Godot will not be coming. He insists that he did not speak to Vladimir yesterday. After he leaves, Estragon and Vladimir decide to leave, but again they do not move as the curtain falls, ending the play."
Bottoms,"The Bottom is a mostly Black community in Ohio, situated in the hills above the mostly white, wealthier community of Medallion. The Bottom first became a community when a master gave it to his former slave. This ""gift"" was in fact a trick: the master gave the former slave a poor stretch of hilly land, convincing the slave the land was worthwhile by claiming that because it was hilly, it was closer to heaven. The trick, though, led to the growth of a vibrant community. Now the community faces a new threat; wealthy whites have taken a liking to the land, and would like to destroy much of the town in order to build a golf course.
Shadrack, a resident of the Bottom, fought in WWI. He returns a shattered man, unable to accept the complexities of the world; he lives on the outskirts of town, attempting to create order in his life. One of his methods involves compartmentalizing his fear of death in a ritual he invents and names National Suicide Day. The town is at first wary of him and his ritual, then, over time, unthinkingly accepts him.
Meanwhile, the families of the children Nel and Sula are contrasted. Nel is the product of a family that believes deeply in social conventions; hers is a stable home, though some might characterize it as rigid. Nel is uncertain of the conventional life her mother, Helene, wants for her; these doubts are hammered home when she meets Rochelle, her grandmother and a former prostitute, the only unconventional woman in her family line. Sula's family is very different: she lives with her grandmother, Eva, and her mother, Hannah, both of whom are seen by the town as eccentric and loose. Their house also serves as a home for three informally adopted boys and a steady stream of borders.
Despite their differences, Sula and Nel become fiercely attached to each other during adolescence. However, a traumatic accident changes everything. One day, Sula playfully swings a neighborhood boy, Chicken Little, around by his hands. When she loses her grip, the boy falls into a nearby river and drowns. They never tell anyone about the accident even though they did not intend to harm the boy. The two girls begin to grow apart. One day, in an accident, Sula's mother's dress catches fire and she dies of the burns.
After high school, Nel chooses to marry and settles into the conventional role of wife and mother. Sula follows a wildly divergent path and lives a life of fierce independence and total disregard for social conventions. Shortly after Nel's wedding, Sula leaves the Bottom for a period of 10 years. She has many affairs, some with white men. However, she finds people following the same boring routines elsewhere, so she returns to the Bottom and to Nel.
Upon her return, the town regards Sula as the very personification of evil for her blatant disregard of social conventions. Their hatred in part rests upon Sula's interracial relationships, but is crystallized when Sula has an affair with Nel's husband, Jude, who subsequently abandons Nel. Ironically, the community's labeling of Sula as evil actually improves their own lives. Her presence in the community gives them the impetus to live harmoniously with one another. Nel breaks off her friendship with Sula. Just before Sula dies in 1940, they achieve a half-hearted reconciliation. With Sula's death, the harmony that had reigned in the town quickly dissolves.
In 1965, with the Bottom facing the prospect of the white golf course, Nel visits Eva in the nursing home. Eva accuses her of sharing the guilt for Chicken Little's death. Her accusation forces Nel to confront the unfairness of her judgment against Sula. Nel admits to herself that she had blamed his death entirely on Sula and set herself up as the ""good"" half of the relationship. Nel comes to realize that in the aftermath of Chicken Little's death she had too quickly clung to social convention in an effort to define herself as ""good."" Nel goes to the cemetery and mourns at Sula's grave, calling out Sula's name in sadness.
Sula is a novel about ambiguity. It questions and examines the terms ""good"" and ""evil,"" often demonstrating that the two often resemble one another. The novel addresses the confusing mysteries of human emotions and relationships, ultimately concluding that social conventions are inadequate as a foundation for living one's life. The novel tempts the reader to apply the diametrically opposed terms of ""good and evil,"" ""right and wrong"" to the characters and their actions, and yet simultaneously shows why it is necessary to resist such temptation. While exploring the ways in which people try to make meaning of lives filled with conflicts over race, gender, and simple idiosyncratic points of views, Sula resists easy answers, demonstrating the ambiguity, beauty, and terror of life, in both its triumphs and horrors."
Indispensably,"Jack Worthing, the play’s protagonist, is a pillar of the community in Hertfordshire, where he is guardian to Cecily Cardew, the pretty, eighteen-year-old granddaughter of the late Thomas Cardew, who found and adopted Jack when he was a baby. In Hertfordshire, Jack has responsibilities: he is a major landowner and justice of the peace, with tenants, farmers, and a number of servants and other employees all dependent on him. For years, he has also pretended to have an irresponsible black-sheep brother named Ernest who leads a scandalous life in pursuit of pleasure and is always getting into trouble of a sort that requires Jack to rush grimly off to his assistance. In fact, Ernest is merely Jack’s alibi, a phantom that allows him to disappear for days at a time and do as he likes. No one but Jack knows that he himself is Ernest. Ernest is the name Jack goes by in London, which is where he really goes on these occasions—probably to pursue the very sort of behavior he pretends to disapprove of in his imaginary brother.
Jack is in love with Gwendolen Fairfax, the cousin of his best friend, Algernon Moncrieff. When the play opens, Algernon, who knows Jack as Ernest, has begun to suspect something, having found an inscription inside Jack’s cigarette case addressed to “Uncle Jack” from someone who refers to herself as “little Cecily.” Algernon suspects that Jack may be leading a double life, a practice he seems to regard as commonplace and indispensable to modern life. He calls a person who leads a double life a “Bunburyist,” after a nonexistent friend he pretends to have, a chronic invalid named Bunbury, to whose deathbed he is forever being summoned whenever he wants to get out of some tiresome social obligation.
At the beginning of Act 1, Jack drops in unexpectedly on Algernon and announces that he intends to propose to Gwendolen. Algernon confronts him with the cigarette case and forces him to come clean, demanding to know who “Jack” and “Cecily” are. Jack confesses that his name isn’t really Ernest and that Cecily is his ward, a responsibility imposed on him by his adoptive father’s will. Jack also tells Algernon about his fictional brother. Jack says he’s been thinking of killing off this fake brother, since Cecily has been showing too active an interest in him. Without meaning to, Jack describes Cecily in terms that catch Algernon’s attention and make him even more interested in her than he is already.
Gwendolen and her mother, Lady Bracknell, arrive, which gives Jack an opportunity to propose to Gwendolen. Jack is delighted to discover that Gwendolen returns his affections, but he is alarmed to learn that Gwendolen is fixated on the name Ernest, which she says “inspires absolute confidence.” Gwendolen makes clear that she would not consider marrying a man who was not named Ernest.
Lady Bracknell interviews Jack to determine his eligibility as a possible son-in-law, and during this interview she asks about his family background. When Jack explains that he has no idea who his parents were and that he was found, by the man who adopted him, in a handbag in the cloakroom at Victoria Station, Lady Bracknell is scandalized. She forbids the match between Jack and Gwendolen and sweeps out of the house.
In Act 2, Algernon shows up at Jack’s country estate posing as Jack’s brother Ernest. Meanwhile, Jack, having decided that Ernest has outlived his usefulness, arrives home in deep mourning, full of a story about Ernest having died suddenly in Paris. He is enraged to find Algernon there masquerading as Ernest but has to go along with the charade. If he doesn’t, his own lies and deceptions will be revealed.
While Jack changes out of his mourning clothes, Algernon, who has fallen hopelessly in love with Cecily, asks her to marry him. He is surprised to discover that Cecily already considers that they are engaged, and he is charmed when she reveals that her fascination with “Uncle Jack’s brother” led her to invent an elaborate romance between herself and him several months ago. Algernon is less enchanted to learn that part of Cecily’s interest in him derives from the name Ernest, which, unconsciously echoing Gwendolen, she says “inspires absolute confidence.”
Algernon goes off in search of Dr. Chasuble, the local rector, to see about getting himself christened Ernest. Meanwhile, Gwendolen arrives, having decided to pay Jack an unexpected visit. Gwendolen is shown into the garden, where Cecily orders tea and attempts to play hostess. Cecily has no idea how Gwendolen figures into Jack’s life, and Gwendolen, for her part, has no idea who Cecily is. Gwendolen initially thinks Cecily is a visitor to the Manor House and is disconcerted to learn that Cecily is “Mr. Worthing’s ward.” She notes that Ernest has never mentioned having a ward, and Cecily explains that it is not Ernest Worthing who is her guardian but his brother Jack and, in fact, that she is engaged to be married to Ernest Worthing. Gwendolen points out that this is impossible as she herself is engaged to Ernest Worthing. The tea party degenerates into a war of manners.
Jack and Algernon arrive toward the climax of this confrontation, each having separately made arrangements with Dr. Chasuble to be christened Ernest later that day. Each of the young ladies points out that the other has been deceived: Cecily informs Gwendolen that her fiancé is really named Jack and Gwendolen informs Cecily that hers is really called Algernon. The two women demand to know where Jack’s brother Ernest is, since both of them are engaged to be married to him. Jack is forced to admit that he has no brother and that Ernest is a complete fiction. Both women are shocked and furious, and they retire to the house arm in arm.
Act 3 takes place in the drawing room of the Manor House, where Cecily and Gwendolen have retired. When Jack and Algernon enter from the garden, the two women confront them. Cecily asks Algernon why he pretended to be her guardian’s brother. Algernon tells her he did it in order to meet her. Gwendolen asks Jack whether he pretended to have a brother in order to come into London to see her as often as possible, and she interprets his evasive reply as an affirmation. The women are somewhat appeased but still concerned over the issue of the name. However, when Jack and Algernon tell Gwendolen and Cecily that they have both made arrangements to be christened Ernest that afternoon, all is forgiven and the two pairs of lovers embrace. At this moment, Lady Bracknell’s arrival is announced.
Lady Bracknell has followed Gwendolen from London, having bribed Gwendolen’s maid to reveal her destination. She demands to know what is going on. Gwendolen again informs Lady Bracknell of her engagement to Jack, and Lady Bracknell reiterates that a union between them is out of the question. Algernon tells Lady Bracknell of his engagement to Cecily, prompting her to inspect Cecily and inquire into her social connections, which she does in a routine and patronizing manner that infuriates Jack. He replies to all her questions with a mixture of civility and sarcasm, withholding until the last possible moment the information that Cecily is actually worth a great deal of money and stands to inherit still more when she comes of age. At this, Lady Bracknell becomes genuinely interested.
Jack informs Lady Bracknell that, as Cecily’s legal guardian, he refuses to give his consent to her union with Algernon. Lady Bracknell suggests that the two young people simply wait until Cecily comes of age, and Jack points out that under the terms of her grandfather’s will, Cecily does not legally come of age until she is thirty-five. Lady Bracknell asks Jack to reconsider, and he points out that the matter is entirely in her own hands. As soon as she consents to his marriage to Gwendolen, Cecily can have his consent to marry Algernon. However, Lady Bracknell refuses to entertain the notion. She and Gwendolen are on the point of leaving when Dr. Chasuble arrives and happens to mention Cecily’s governess, Miss Prism. At this, Lady Bracknell starts and asks that Miss Prism be sent for.
When the governess arrives and catches sight of Lady Bracknell, she begins to look guilty and furtive. Lady Bracknell accuses her of having left her sister’s house twenty-eight years before with a baby and never returned. She demands to know where the baby is. Miss Prism confesses she doesn’t know, explaining that she lost the baby, having absentmindedly placed it in a handbag in which she had meant to place the manuscript for a novel she had written. Jack asks what happened to the bag, and Miss Prism says she left it in the cloakroom of a railway station. Jack presses her for further details and goes racing offstage, returning a few moments later with a large handbag. When Miss Prism confirms that the bag is hers, Jack throws himself on her with a cry of “Mother!” It takes a while before the situation is sorted out, but before too long we understand that Jack is not the illegitimate child of Miss Prism but the legitimate child of Lady Bracknell’s sister and, therefore, Algernon’s older brother. Furthermore, Jack had been originally christened “Ernest John.” All these years Jack has unwittingly been telling the truth: Ernest is his name, as is Jack, and he does have an unprincipled younger brother—Algernon. Again the couples embrace, Miss Prism and Dr. Chasuble follow suit, and Jack acknowledges that he now understands “the vital Importance of Being Earnest.”"
Dreams,"Animal Dreams opens with a brief chapter narrated in the third person, from the point of view of Doc Homer. This establishes a double narrative voice, which switches between dreams and memories of the past and events of the present. Doc Homer remembers his daughters, Codi and Hallie, when they were young. Their mother is dead.
In the second chapter, narrated by Codi in first person, the plot line begins. Hallie leaves Tucson, Arizona, where she was living with Codi and Carlo, for Nicaragua. She plans to assist the newly established communist regime with their crop cultivation. Shortly thereafter, Codi also leaves Tucson, returning to her small rural hometown, Grace, to care for her ailing father and to teach high school biology. The return to Grace is fraught with difficulty for Codi, as she has always felt herself an outsider in the town and has never had a very close relationship with her father. Her return home raises the specter of several mysteries surrounding Codi and her family's past: her failure to hold a medical license despite her attendance at medical school, the deaths of her mother and of her child, and the relationship of her family to the rest of the community.
In Grace, Codi stays in her friend Emelina Domingos's guest house. As the two women talk, Codi's high school relationship with Loyd Peregrina is revealed. Loyd, a friend of Emelina's husband J.T., still lives and works in town. Re-visiting Grace, Codi is again struck by her feeling of being an outsider. Codi and Hallie's mother died shortly after Hallie's birth. At the age of fifteen, Codi became pregnant with and then miscarried Loyd's child. She never told anyone. Her father, the town doctor, was aware of the situation, but Codi still does not know this.
Codi and Loyd meet again and begin a new relationship. Loyd, a Native American who grew up on the nearby Reservation, is ready to establish a serious and committed relationship, but Codi is not ready to imagine herself as staying in one place or loving only one person. Loyd accepts her ambivalence. They continue to see each other, and he teaches her about Native American Cultures.
Meanwhile, the town of Grace faces a terrible threat to its very existence. The local Black Mountain Mine has been dumping sulfuric acid and other chemicals into the water supply for years. This water is necessary for the irrigation of the pecan and fruit trees that are integral to the community's survival. While the men of town notified the Environmental Protection Agency of the problem, the only solution the EPA requires, that the river be dammed above the town, is almost worse than the problem. The older women of the town, who meet weekly at the Stitch and Bitch Club, take their own initiative. They make piñatas, decorated with the feathers of local peacocks and accompanied by a note detailing Grace's problem, which they sell in Tucson. Because Emelina's mother-in-law Viola is one of the main organizers of the Stitch and Bitch Club and because Codi's education is of great help to their cause, Codi joins with the women. She involves her classes as well. As she becomes a part of the community effort to save the town, Codi also begins to learn more about her own family's past. It turns out that the story her father had always told her about their family—that they were outsiders in Grace while almost everyone else is related to one another—may not be exactly true.
All this time, Codi and Hallie, who have always been extremely close, exchange letters. On Christmas Day, Doc Homer receives a call from Nicaragua informing him that Hallie has been abducted by the US-backed Contras. Codi is thoroughly distraught. She spends the next few months between deep depression and frenzied attempts to find Hallie. During this period, the efforts of the Stitch and Bitch Club gain an enormous amount of publicity, and finally an art dealer arrives in Grace who offers them a solution to their problems. They can apply to have Grace named a Historic Place and gain federal protection for their orchards and their water supply. In helping to document Grace's historic status, Codi learns more about her own family history. It turns out that both her mother and her father are natives of Grace and are related to everyone else in the community. Her father is descended from the black sheep of the founding Gracela sisters, and therefore he tried to change his name to pretend that both he and her mother were outsiders. Although everyone went along with his facade, the whole community is aware of the truth. This discovery combined with her involvement in Grace's present struggles allow Codi to slowly feel that she is less of an outsider, although she still does not plan to stay in Grace beyond the one-year teaching contract.
Toward the end of the school year, Hallie's body is found in Nicaragua. The Stitch and Bitch Club file the Historic Place petition and the Black Mountain Mine declares that it will shut down and clean up the river. Codi leaves Grace to rejoin Carlo, not because she loves him but because he is moving on and she still feels a need to do the same. However, the plane she takes to join him has engine trouble and is forced to turn around. When they land safely back in Tucson, Codi immediately gets on a train and returns to Grace. She holds a memorial ceremony for Hallie, which all of Grace attends. As she buries the symbolic bundle in Doc Homer's garden plot, the two of them finally clear up the last of their secrets. Codi also tells Loyd about his child that she lost. In the last chapter, we see that a year later, Doc Homer is dead, and Codi, still teaching at the high school, is again pregnant by Loyd."
Contentious,"Blanche DuBois, a schoolteacher from Laurel, Mississippi, arrives at the New Orleans apartment of her sister, Stella Kowalski. Despite the fact that Blanche seems to have fallen out of close contact with Stella, she intends to stay at Stella’s apartment for an unspecified but likely lengthy period of time, given the large trunk she has with her. Blanche tells Stella that she lost Belle Reve, their ancestral home, following the death of all their remaining relatives. She also mentions that she has been given a leave of absence from her teaching position because of her bad nerves.
Though Blanche does not seem to have enough money to afford a hotel, she is disdainful of the cramped quarters of the Kowalskis’ two-room apartment and of the apartment’s location in a noisy, diverse, working-class neighborhood. Blanche’s social condescension wins her the instant dislike of Stella’s husband, an auto-parts supply man of Polish descent named Stanley Kowalski. It is clear that Stella was happy to leave behind her the social pretensions of her background in exchange for the sexual gratification she gets from her husband; she even is pregnant with his baby. Stanley immediately distrusts Blanche to the extent that he suspects her of having cheated Stella out of her share of the family inheritance. In the process of defending herself to Stanley, Blanche reveals that Belle Reve was lost due to a foreclosed mortgage, a disclosure that signifies the dire nature of Blanche’s financial circumstances. Blanche’s heavy drinking, which she attempts to conceal from her sister and brother-in-law, is another sign that all is not well with Blanche.
The unhappiness that accompanies the animal magnetism of Stella and Stanley’s marriage reveals itself when Stanley hosts a drunken poker game with his male friends at the apartment. Blanche gets under Stanley’s skin, especially when she starts to win the affections of his close friend Mitch. After Mitch has been absent for a while, speaking with Blanche in the bedroom, Stanley erupts, storms into the bedroom, and throws the radio out of the window. When Stella yells at Stanley and defends Blanche, Stanley beats her. The men pull him off, the poker game breaks up, and Blanche and Stella escape to their upstairs neighbor Eunice’s apartment. A short while later, Stanley is remorseful and cries up to Stella to forgive him. To Blanche’s alarm, Stella returns to Stanley and embraces him passionately. Mitch meets Blanche outside of the Kowalski flat and comforts her in her distress.
The next day, Blanche tries to convince Stella to leave Stanley for a better man whose social status equals Stella’s. Blanche suggests that she and Stella contact a millionaire named Shep Huntleigh for help escaping from New Orleans; when Stella laughs at her, Blanche reveals that she is completely broke. Stanley walks in as Blanche is making fun of him and secretly overhears Blanche and Stella’s conversation. Later, he threatens Blanche with hints that he has heard rumors of her disreputable past. She is visibly dismayed.
While Blanche is alone in the apartment one evening, waiting for Mitch to pick her up for a date, a teenage boy comes by to collect money for the newspaper. Blanche doesn’t have any money for him, but she hits on him and gives him a lustful kiss. Soon after the boy departs, Mitch arrives, and they go on their date. When Blanche returns, she is exhausted and clearly has been uneasy for the entire night about the rumors Stanley mentioned earlier. In a surprisingly sincere heart-to-heart discussion with Mitch, Blanche reveals the greatest tragedy of her past. Years ago, her young husband committed suicide after she discovered and chastised him for his homosexuality. Mitch describes his own loss of a former love, and he tells Blanche that they need each other.
When the next scene begins, about one month has passed. It is the afternoon of Blanche’s birthday. Stella is preparing a dinner for Blanche, Mitch, Stanley, and herself, when Stanley comes in to tell her that he has learned news of Blanche’s sordid past. He says that after losing the DuBois mansion, Blanche moved into a fleabag motel from which she was eventually evicted because of her numerous sexual liaisons. Also, she was fired from her job as a schoolteacher because the principal discovered that she was having an affair with a teenage student. Stella is horrified to learn that Stanley has told Mitch these stories about Blanche.
The birthday dinner comes and goes, but Mitch never arrives. Stanley indicates to Blanche that he is aware of her past. For a birthday present, he gives her a one-way bus ticket back to Laurel. Stanley’s cruelty so disturbs Stella that it appears the Kowalski household is about to break up, but the onset of Stella’s labor prevents the imminent fight.
Several hours later, Blanche, drunk, sits alone in the apartment. Mitch, also drunk, arrives and repeats all he’s learned from Stanley. Eventually Blanche confesses that the stories are true, but she also reveals the need for human affection she felt after her husband’s death. Mitch tells Blanche that he can never marry her, saying she isn’t fit to live in the same house as his mother. Having learned that Blanche is not the chaste lady she pretended to be, Mitch tries to have sex with Blanche, but she forces him to leave by yelling “Fire!” to attract the attention of passersby outside.
Later, Stanley returns from the hospital to find Blanche even more drunk. She tells him that she will soon be leaving New Orleans with her former suitor Shep Huntleigh, who is now a millionaire. Stanley knows that Blanche’s story is entirely in her imagination, but he is so happy about his baby that he proposes they each celebrate their good fortune. Blanche spurns Stanley, and things grow contentious. When she tries to step past him, he refuses to move out of her way. Blanche becomes terrified to the point that she smashes a bottle on the table and threatens to smash Stanley in the face. Stanley grabs her arm and says that it’s time for the “date” they’ve had set up since Blanche’s arrival. Blanche resists, but Stanley uses his physical strength to overcome her, and he carries her to bed. The pulsing music indicates that Stanley rapes Blanche.
The next scene takes place weeks later, as Stella and her neighbor Eunice pack Blanche’s bags. Blanche is in the bath, and Stanley plays poker with his buddies in the front room. A doctor will arrive soon to take Blanche to an insane asylum, but Blanche believes she is leaving to join her millionaire. Stella confesses to Eunice that she simply cannot allow herself to believe Blanche’s assertion that Stanley raped her. When Blanche emerges from the bathroom, her deluded talk makes it clear that she has lost her grip on reality.
The doctor arrives with a nurse, and Blanche initially panics and struggles against them when they try to take her away. Stanley and his friends fight to subdue Blanche, while Eunice holds Stella back to keep her from interfering. Mitch begins to cry. Finally, the doctor approaches Blanche in a gentle manner and convinces her to leave with him. She allows him to lead her away and does not look back or say goodbye as she goes. Stella sobs with her child in her arms, and Stanley comforts her with loving words and caresses."
Adds,"On an otherwise typical day at Gordon High School, history teacher Mr. Ross shows his students a film about the Holocaust, displaying horrific scenes of starved, tortured, and killed prisoners inside Nazi concentration camps. Students watch in shock, though the film’s lasting impact varies. David Collins, the football team’s running back, naively believes the Holocaust was merely a part of history and that its crimes could never occur again. However, Laurie Saunders, editor-in-chief of the school newspaper and David’s girlfriend, is deeply troubled and insists the film and its history can’t be forgotten. For most students, the film and Mr. Ross’s accompanying lesson on fascism in post-World War I Germany spawn questions about how the Holocaust was allowed to happen. Students question how so many Germans gave in to the Nazis’ will, turned their eyes from or participated in such heinous crimes, and later pretended they didn’t know such horrible events occurred. Despite Mr. Ross’s talents as a teacher, however, he’s unable to provide any real answers. He then conceives a classroom “experiment” to simulate life in Nazi Germany, believing real-life experience will be the only way students can find answers to such critical questions. 
In history class the next day, Mr. Ross writes “STRENGTH THROUGH DISCIPLINE” on the blackboard. He then introduces strict speaking rules and, similar to a military leader, has students practice returning to their seats in a disciplined, unified manner. Students are immediately receptive to Mr. Ross’s militaristic exercises and the next day appear eager for more orders. His experiment then morphs into a full-blown movement called The Wave. To its motto, Mr. Ross adds the words “Community,” saying that all members must work together and be treated as equals, and later, he adds the word “Action.” He also creates a symbol for the movement, along with exclusive membership cards and a salute, then appoints several monitors to keep an eye out for dissenters. Soon, The Wave swells throughout Gordon High, with many students fully embracing the movement’s promises of power, community, and equality. Meanwhile, many of The Wave’s members also undergo significant transformations. David, for example, emerges as one of its chief supporters, enthusiastically introducing its principles to the school’s woeful football team. Robert Billings, a former target of frequent bullying, rises as one of The Wave’s most prominent figures and most zealous defenders. 
As The Wave gains momentum, though, more savvy characters see through its false promises. Bright and politically astute, Laurie’s mother, Mrs. Saunders, detects fascistic, cult-like tendencies in The Wave. Mrs. Saunders also worries that Mr. Ross is manipulating students and criticizes the movement for infringing on individualism and individual rights. Her concerns sow seeds of doubt in Laurie, who soon rises as a voice of conscience, questioning her peers’ increasingly fascistic behavior. Laurie’s concerns grow when she receives an anonymous letter at the newspaper’s office, written by a junior who was threatened by a senior for not wanting to join The Wave, and later when a Jewish sophomore is beaten up at school. 
Laurie teams up with reporters Carl Block and Alex Cooper to publish a special edition of the school paper to expose the truths about The Wave. As a result, many Wave members defect and similar stories of abuse emerge, but the exposé also fuels flames of fanaticism in the movement’s most ardent supporters. Robert and Brian Ammon, the school’s quarterback, tell David that Laurie must be silenced, and that night, after Laurie escapes an attempted attack at school, David confronts her and demands she stop speaking out against The Wave. When David throws Laurie to the ground, though, he suddenly sees how blind he’s been, and all the harm The Wave has caused. The couple then visits Mr. Ross’s house, insisting he end the movement.
Although Mr. Ross was seduced by power from the start and overlooked serious warning signs that his experiment had gone too far, he’s now fully aware that The Wave must end. Still, Mr. Ross believes that for all of Gordon High’s students to learn the lessons he intended to teach, he must see his experiment through to a powerful conclusion. The next day, the school’s principal, Mr. Owens, agrees with Mr. Ross’s plan. That day, Mr. Ross tells students The Wave isn’t merely a classroom lesson, but a nationwide movement to create a youth brigade, one that’s desperately needed to fix all that currently ails the United States. Students later gather at an assembly, where Mr. Ross promises the movement’s leader will be revealed. In stunning climax of The Wave, Alex and Carl help Mr. Ross display a giant image of Adolf Hitler. Instantly shocked and deflated, students see how they were fooled by, and complicit in, a fascistic, totalitarian movement that resembles Nazism. Mr. Ross then scolds students, and himself, for all that transpired. He knows, though, that however difficult its lessons, his experiment titled “The Wave” was needed for students to find answers to their original questions about how the Holocaust could have occurred, answers that will ultimately help them prevent its crimes from repeating."
Insufficient,"Lawyer Bryan Stevenson gives a first-person account of his decades helping marginalized Americans who have been unfairly and harshly punished by the U.S. criminal justice system, which disproportionately targets people of color and poor people. At the heart of Just Mercy is the story of Walter McMillian, a Black man who was framed for the murder of a girl named Ronda Morrison, convicted, and sent to death row. 
Stevenson alternates chapters about Walter with his personal reflections on our country’s history with racial disparity and issues around incarceration. Stevenson highlights other groups of vulnerable people who have been victimized by the criminal justice system and shares the stories of the prisoners he has helped over the years. The book also follows the growth of Stevenson’s nonprofit law project, the Alabama-based Equal Justice Initiative (EJI), through its expansion from focusing on death row prisoners to helping people sentenced to life without parole. Stevenson chronicles how EJI becomes a significant force in criminal justice reform.
In 1983 as a law student, Stevenson discovers his life’s passion when he interns with the Georgia-based Southern Prisoners Defense Committee and meets his first death row prisoner. After graduation Stevenson accepts a job with the organization to represent poor prisoners, including those in Alabama who lack any public defender. He meets Walter McMillian on Alabama’s death row. Walter owns a successful business but also transgresses racial boundaries when he has an affair with a white woman. Soon after the affair becomes public, the woman’s friend, Ralph Myers, accuses Walter of committing the unsolved murder of Ronda Morrison, which has outraged the community. Law enforcement, including a racist sheriff and the district attorney, eagerly pounces on this accusation, overlooking Walter’s alibi and a lack of evidence. Instead, they actively force Ralph to stick with his story even when he tries to recant. They coerce other false witness testimonies, and—as revealed years later—actively suppress evidence.
After Stevenson and the team at EJI unsuccessfully appeal Walter’s conviction, they launch their own investigation of the crime and uncover new evidence. They find witnesses who can prove the witnesses against Walter lied as well as financial records that indicate that one of these witnesses was paid to give false testimony. Stevenson and his team also petition for and receive all records from Walter’s trial. However, their big break comes when they receive a phone call from Ralph, who now wants to make amends. Ralph admits to lying about Walter and says he was threatened by law enforcement. Stevenson wins a hearing for Walter where he can present his new evidence: Ralph’s testimony, which is confirmed by health care workers and other inmates, as well as recordings of the law enforcement team threatening Ralph if he doesn’t frame Walter. 
While the judge refuses to grant Walter relief, Stevenson continues the appeal process through the Alabama courts. The district attorney asks outside agents to investigate the murder for which Walter was convicted, and the investigators determine that Walter had nothing to do with the crime. Six weeks later, the court invalidates Walter’s conviction. Stevenson and the State file a joint motion to dismiss the charges, and Walter is set free.
Throughout the process, Stevenson and Walter become close friends, and Stevenson helps Walter upon his release, including filing a civil suit on his behalf and offering him a place to stay. Walter works with Stevenson to share his story, giving interviews and speaking at legal conferences, and Walter is even featured in a documentary. Unfortunately, Walter is diagnosed with advancing dementia and is forced to rely on family and eventually a nursing facility for his care. He dies in 2013. Stevenson gives a eulogy at his funeral and shares all he learned from Walter, particularly that we must extend mercy to everyone, even those who have not earned it.
Interspersed with chapters chronicling Walter’s narrative are stories of Stevenson’s other clients and work. His closeness with these prisoners and their horrifying circumstances makes Stevenson more determined to help and causes him to reflect on abstract issues that nevertheless imbue the criminal justice system, like humanity and mercy. Stevenson focuses on several categories of vulnerable people who become trapped in the system, including mentally ill prisoners, disabled prisoners, and poor women who give birth to stillborn babies. 
Stevenson and his team at EJI also become increasingly focused on juvenile offenders who are sometimes tried as adults despite their young age. These offenders may be given de facto death sentences by being sentenced to life without parole and face perilous circumstances when they are housed in adult prisons. Stevenson illustrates how these prisoners retain their own humanity while being forced to live under inhumane conditions. He also discusses some of the qualities common among these types of prisoners: They are generally poor and disproportionately people of color, and most of them lack adequate legal counsel. The juveniles have horrific backgrounds of abuse and neglect.
Stevenson and his team at EJI also work to change the legal system to offer more protection to marginalized people. Several of his cases end up before the U.S. Supreme Court, and he succeeds in winning rulings that ban as unconstitutional the conviction of children to life without parole and the execution of people deemed incompetent from dementia or neurological disease. EJI works to raise public awareness of issues surrounding unfair incarceration, produces groundbreaking reports on racial issues, and sets up programs to help formerly incarcerated people adjust to life on the outside.
Stevenson also reflects on the issues that surround the criminal justice system. His time spent with prisoners awaiting their execution makes him realize how inhumane it is to prepare another human to die. After decades of work, when Stevenson fails to prevent the execution of a man who suffers from an intellectual disability, he momentarily feels unable to continue his work. However, he realizes that he cannot help but be broken by his experiences and comes to understand that it is his own brokenness that allows him to more fully understand the need for mercy and to bring compassion to others. The book ends with Stevenson’s renewed commitment to helping others."

Lot,"Oedipa Maas, the young wife of a man named Mucho, lives in Kinneret, California. One day, she receives a letter from a law firm telling her that her ex-boyfriend, Pierce Inverarity, has died and named her the executor of his estate. Oedipa resolves to faithfully execute her duty, and she travels to San Narciso (Pierce's hometown) where she meets the lawyer, Metzger, assigned to help her, with whom she spontaneously begins an affair.
As they go about sorting through Pierce's tangled financial affairs, Oedipa takes note of the fact that Pierce owned an extensive stamp collection. One night, Oedipa and Metzger go to a bar called The Scope, where they meet Mike Fallopian, a member of a right-wing fanatical organization called the Peter Pinguid Society. In the bathroom of the bar, Oedipa sees a symbol that she later learns is supposed to represent a muted post horn. Written below the symbol are the acronym W.A.S.T.E. and the name ""Kirby."" Oedipa makes a note of all this info before returning to chat with Mike at the bar.
Oedipa and Metzger take a trip one day to Fangoso Lagoons, an area in which Pierce owned a substantial amount of land. There, they meet a man named Manny di Presso, a lawyer who is suing the Inverarity estate on behalf of his client, who recovered and sold human bones to Inverarity but did not receive proper payment. Pierce wanted the bones to make charcoal for cigarette filters. A member of The Paranoids, a hippie band that follows Oedipa around, points out that Manny's story is similar to that of the 17th-century play The Courier's Tragedy. Oedipa and Metzger decide to see a production of the play nearby. The play mentions the word ""Tristero,"" a word that fascinates Oedipa because of its placement within the play. She goes backstage to speak with the director, Randolph Driblette, who tells her to stop overanalyzing the play. She resolves to call him back later.
After rereading Pierce's will later on, Oedipa goes to a stockholders' meeting for the Yoyodyne company, a firm owned in part by Inverarity. After taking a brief tour, she stumbles into the office of Stanley Koteks, who is drawing the muted post horn symbol on his pad of paper. He tells her about a scientist named John Nefastis who has built a type of Mexwell's Demon, or a physically impossible machine that allows for perpetual motion by violating the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Koteks encourages Oedipa to meet with Nefastis.
Wanting to learn more about The Courier's Tragedy, Oedipa gets an anthology of Jacobean revenge plays. She notices that the paperback copy has no mention of the Tristero, however, which puzzles her. She decides to go to Berkeley to meet with the publisher. In the meantime, she stops by an elderly care home that Pierce had owned, where she meets an old man with a ring depicting the muted post horn. She also hires a philatelist (stamp expert) named Genghis Cohen to go through Pierce's stamp collection. After doing so, Genghis tells her that some of Pierce's stamps have a muted post horn in their watermark. Oedipa begins to realize that she is uncovering a large mystery.
Oedipa goes to Berkeley to meet with John Nefastis, who shows her his perpetual motion machine. It can only be operated by people with special mental capabilities allowing them to communicate with the machine, and he tells Oedipa that she has no such mental skills. He then propositions her, causing her to run out screaming. Oedipa then begins a very, very long night of wandering around aimlessly all over the Bay area. She encounters the muted post horn symbol almost everywhere, leading her to believe that she may be hallucinating. Just before dawn, however, she encounters an old man who hands her a letter and asks her to deliver it via W.A.S.T.E. under the freeway. After helping the man to his room, Oedipa finds a W.A.S.T.E. facility under the freeway, drops in the letter and waits for the delivery man, whom she follows to Oakland and back to Berkeley after he picks up the letters and delivers them. Oedipa returns to her home in Kinneret to see her doctor, who begins shooting at her as she pulls up. He has gone crazy, obsessed with the idea that Israelis are coming to kill him because he assisted the Nazis in World War II. After he is arrested, Oedipa sees her husband, Mucho, and spends some time with him, although she quickly sees that he has become addicted to LSD, making it difficult to communicate effectively.
Increasingly alone, Oedipa seeks out Emory Bortz, an English professor at San Narciso College who has extensive knowledge of Jacobean revenge plays. With his help, she pieces together the history of the Tristero, which dates back to mid-16th-century Europe. She learns that Driblette has died, which means she will never know why he included the lines about the Tristero in his production of The Courier's Tragedy (these lines are not ordinarily included in the play). Oedipa begins to give up as she realizes that she is very lonely and has no real friends. She visits Mike Fallopian again, who suggests that the whole Tristero mystery may be nothing more than a huge, complex joke played on her by Pierce. Oedipa will not accept this possibility but realizes that every route leading to the Tristero also leads to the Inverarity Estate. Meanwhile, Genghis Cohen helps her piece together some mysteries about Pierce's stamp collection, which is to be auctioned off by a local dealer as Lot 49. Genghis has heard that a secretive bidder will attend the auction to bid on Lot 49, but he will not reveal himself beforehand. Oedipa goes to the auction, excited to find out who the bidder is, thinking that he may know the key to the Tristero. The novel ends as Oedipa sits in the room waiting for the crying of Lot 49, when she will discover the identity of the mystery bidder."
Battle,"King Hrothgar of Denmark, a descendant of the great king Shield Sheafson, enjoys a prosperous and successful reign. He builds a great mead-hall, called Heorot, where his warriors can gather to drink, receive gifts from their lord, and listen to stories sung by the scops, or bards. But the jubilant noise from Heorot angers Grendel, a horrible demon who lives in the swamplands of Hrothgar’s kingdom. Grendel terrorizes the Danes every night, killing them and defeating their efforts to fight back. The Danes suffer many years of fear, danger, and death at the hands of Grendel. Eventually, however, a young Geatish warrior named Beowulf hears of Hrothgar’s plight. Inspired by the challenge, Beowulf sails to Denmark with a small company of men, determined to defeat Grendel.
Hrothgar, who had once done a great favor for Beowulf’s father Ecgtheow, accepts Beowulf’s offer to fight Grendel and holds a feast in the hero’s honor. During the feast, an envious Dane named Unferth taunts Beowulf and accuses him of being unworthy of his reputation. Beowulf responds with a boastful description of some of his past accomplishments. His confidence cheers the Danish warriors, and the feast lasts merrily into the night. At last, however, Grendel arrives. Beowulf fights him unarmed, proving himself stronger than the demon, who is terrified. As Grendel struggles to escape, Beowulf tears the monster’s arm off. Mortally wounded, Grendel slinks back into the swamp to die. The severed arm is hung high in the mead-hall as a trophy of victory.
Overjoyed, Hrothgar showers Beowulf with gifts and treasure at a feast in his honor. Songs are sung in praise of Beowulf, and the celebration lasts late into the night. But another threat is approaching. Grendel’s mother, a swamp-hag who lives in a desolate lake, comes to Heorot seeking revenge for her son’s death. She murders Aeschere, one of Hrothgar’s most trusted advisers, before slinking away. To avenge Aeschere’s death, the company travels to the murky swamp, where Beowulf dives into the water and fights Grendel’s mother in her underwater lair. He kills her with a sword forged for a giant, then, finding Grendel’s corpse, decapitates it and brings the head as a prize to Hrothgar. The Danish countryside is now purged of its treacherous monsters.
The Danes are again overjoyed, and Beowulf’s fame spreads across the kingdom. Beowulf departs after a sorrowful goodbye to Hrothgar, who has treated him like a son. He returns to Geatland, where he and his men are reunited with their king and queen, Hygelac and Hygd, to whom Beowulf recounts his adventures in Denmark. Beowulf then hands over most of his treasure to Hygelac, who, in turn, rewards him.
In time, Hygelac is killed in a war against the Shyflings, and, after Hygelac’s son dies, Beowulf ascends to the throne of the Geats. He rules wisely for fifty years, bringing prosperity to Geatland. When Beowulf is an old man, however, a thief disturbs a barrow, or mound, where a great dragon lies guarding a horde of treasure. Enraged, the dragon emerges from the barrow and begins unleashing fiery destruction upon the Geats. Sensing his own death approaching, Beowulf goes to fight the dragon. With the aid of Wiglaf, he succeeds in killing the beast, but at a heavy cost. The dragon bites Beowulf in the neck, and its fiery venom kills him moments after their encounter. The Geats fear that their enemies will attack them now that Beowulf is dead. According to Beowulf’s wishes, they burn their departed king’s body on a huge funeral pyre and then bury him with a massive treasure in a barrow overlooking the sea."
Unbroken,"Unbroken tells the life story of Louis Silvie Zamperini, known as “Louie,” a man who gains national attention for competing as a runner in the 1936 Berlin Olympics. Louie is later reported to be dead after a military plane crash in the Pacific Ocean during World War II and surprises the world by returning home alive after the war.
Louie is a man with incredible endurance who miraculously survived many trials, including a long sea journey on a raft and then years of cruel treatment as a Japanese prisoner of war. He survives through a combination of inner strength, luck, and camaraderie with other POWs. His great friend Russell Allen Phillips, known during the war as “Phil,” experiences many of the same hardships that Louie faces, including the plane crash, raft journey, and cruel treatment in POW camps. Phil and other soldiers serve important roles in the story, as do members of Louie’s family. Much of the book focuses on Louie’s wartime experiences in Japan.
The American public is stunned to learn of Zamperini’s ultimate survival. He is again a celebrity. But upon returning home from the war, Louie struggles with the war demons and with alcohol abuse. He is full of anger and desires revenge on those who had dehumanized him, particularly the sadistic POW camp leader Mitsuhiro Watanabe, whom Louie and others call “the Bird.” Louie’s marriage nearly falls apart. Then Louie encounters Billy Graham and finds religion to be the ultimate antidote for what ailed him. This helps him save his marriage and find bliss with his wife and children. He spends the rest of his life full of joy, devoted to sharing his life story, spreading religious messages, and helping others. He is physically and mentally active into his nineties.
Author Lauren Hillenbrand tells Louie’s story against the backdrop of the war years. Hillenbrand’s book is informed by interviews with numerous veterans and their family members, along with extensive historical research. While focusing on Louie, the book tells a great deal about the history of World War II in the Pacific, in Japan, and at home. It brings to life the personal experiences, tragedies and sacrifices that affected the country and the world.

Unbroken is a story about the capacities of human beings to survive, to serve others, including their country. It is also a story about the capacities of human beings to inflict pain and harm on others, through killing, deprivation and other acts of cruelty.
Part One of the book focuses on Louie’s mischievous boyhood and his unexpected development into an Olympic runner. This section explains how Louie’s background and personality prepared him to do what came next, during the war and after. This section shows how tough, determined and resilient he was, even as a very young child. With help from his brother Pete, he takes up running and miraculously performs well enough to travels to Berlin for the 1936. In Berlin, he has the first experience of the coming war. He also has occasion to meet Adolf Hitler."
Longings,"In the novel’s foreword, the fictional John Ray, Jr., Ph.D., explains the strange story that will follow. According to Ray, he received the manuscript, entitled Lolita, or the 	Confession of a White Widowed Male, from the author’s lawyer. The author himself, known by the pseudonym of Humbert Humbert (or H. H.), died in jail of coronary thrombosis while awaiting a trial. Ray asserts that while the author’s actions are despicable, his writing remains beautiful and persuasive. He also indicates that the novel will become a favorite in psychiatric circles as well as encourage parents to raise better children in a better world. 
In the manuscript, Humbert relates his peaceful upbringing on the Riviera, where he encounters his first love, the twelve-year-old Annabel Leigh. Annabel and the thirteen-year-old Humbert never consummate their love, and Annabel’s death from typhus four months later haunts Humbert. Although Humbert goes on to a career as a teacher of English literature, he spends time in a mental institution and works a succession of odd jobs. Despite his marriage to an adult woman, which eventually fails, Humbert remains obsessed with sexually desirable and sexually aware young girls. These nymphets, as he calls them, remind him of Annabel, though he fails to find another like her. Eventually, Humbert comes to the United States and takes a room in the house of widow Charlotte Haze in a sleepy, suburban New England town. He becomes instantly infatuated with her twelve-year-old daughter Dolores, also known as Lolita. Humbert follows Lolita’s moves constantly, occasionally flirts with her, and confides his pedophiliac longings to a journal. Meanwhile, Charlotte Haze, whom Humbert loathes, has fallen in love with him. When Charlotte sends Lolita off to summer camp, Humbert marries Charlotte in order to stay near his true love. Humbert wants to be alone with Lolita and even toys with the idea of killing Charlotte, but he can’t go through with it. However, Charlotte finds his diary and, after learning that he hates her but loves her daughter, confronts him. Humbert denies everything, but Charlotte tells him she is leaving him and storms out of the house. At that moment, a car hits her and she dies instantly. 
Humbert goes to the summer camp and picks up Lolita. Only when they arrive at a motel does he tell her that Charlotte has died. In his account of events, Humbert claims that Lolita seduces him, rather than the other way around. The two drive across the country for nearly a year, during which time Humbert becomes increasingly obsessed with Lolita and she learns to manipulate him. When she engages in tantrums or refuses his advances, Humbert threatens to put her in an orphanage. At the same time, a strange man seems to take an interest in Humbert and Lolita and appears to be following them in their travels.
Humbert eventually gets a job at Beardsley College somewhere in the Northeast, and Lolita enrolls in school. Her wish to socialize with boys her own age causes a strain in their relationship, and Humbert becomes more restrictive in his rules. Nonetheless, he allows her to appear in a school play. Lolita begins to behave secretively around Humbert, and he accuses her of being unfaithful and takes her away on another road trip. On the road, Humbert suspects that they are being followed. Lolita doesn’t notice anything, and Humbert accuses her of conspiring with their stalker. 
Lolita becomes ill, and Humbert must take her to the hospital. However, when Humbert returns to get her, the nurses tell him that her uncle has already picked her up. Humbert flies into a rage, but then he calms himself and leaves the hospital, heartbroken and angry.
For the next two years, Humbert searches for Lolita, unearthing clues about her kidnapper in order to exact his revenge. He halfheartedly takes up with a woman named Rita, but then he receives a note from Lolita, now married and pregnant, asking for money. Assuming that Lolita has married the man who had followed them on their travels, Humbert becomes determined to kill him. He finds Lolita, poor and pregnant at seventeen. Humbert realizes that Lolita’s husband is not the man who kidnapped her from the hospital. When pressed, Lolita admits that Clare Quilty, a playwright whose presence has been felt from the beginning of the book, had taken her from the hospital. Lolita loved Quilty, but he kicked her out when she refused to participate in a child pornography orgy. Still devoted to Lolita, Humbert begs her to return to him. Lolita gently refuses. Humbert gives her 4,000 dollars and then departs. He tracks down Quilty at his house and shoots him multiple times, killing him. Humbert is arrested and put in jail, where he continues to write his memoir, stipulating that it can only be published upon Lolita’s death. After Lolita dies in childbirth, Humbert dies of heart failure, and the manuscript is sent to John Ray, Jr., Ph.D."
Week,"Rashad and Quinn are both students at Springfield Central High School. They have some friends in common but have never interacted with each other. Rashad is Black, and his father has told him throughout his life about the importance of discipline for young Black men. Rashad’s father joined the army and then the police force before retiring and often tells Rashad that the army is the best opportunity for a Black man to succeed in the United States. Because of this, Rashad is part of the Reserve Officer Training Corps, or ROTC. However, Rashad would rather spend his time drawing and hanging out with his friends English, Shannon, and Carlos. 
Quinn is white, and his father died in Afghanistan. Quinn lives with his mother and his younger brother, Willy, and resents that people expect him to live up to the memory of his father. Quinn’s best friends are Dwyer and Guzzo, who lives across the street. Guzzo’s brother, Paul Galluzzo, is a police officer and has acted as a father figure to Quinn ever since Quinn’s father died. Quinn, Dwyer, and Guzzo are on the basketball team together, along with English.
One Friday, Rashad and Quinn are each planning on going to a party with their friends at Guzzo and Paul’s cousin Jill’s house. Quinn has a crush on Jill. On the way to the party, Rashad stops at Jerry’s Corner Mart to pick up some chips and gum. Jerry’s is always monitored by a police officer as a response to shoplifting incidents at the store. While Rashad is picking out chips, he goes to text his brother, Spoony. His phone is in his bag, so he puts it on the floor and kneels down to take the phone out. While he is kneeling, a woman who was standing behind him backs up and trips over him, causing them both to fall over and Rashad’s chips to slide up the aisle. 
The police officer on duty comes over and asks what happened but assumes Rashad was trying to steal before Rashad or the woman can explain. The police officer drags Rashad outside, handcuffs him, throws him to the ground, and begins beating him. Meanwhile, Quinn and his friends have been waiting in the alley next to Jerry’s to ask an adult to buy them beer that they can take to the party. When Quinn goes around to the front of Jerry’s, he sees what the police officer is doing to Rashad. He recognizes the police officer as Paul Galluzzo. He tells his friends to run and, when they are far enough away, explains what happened and tells Guzzo that he saw his brother. The three decide to go to the party and try to forget about it.
Over the weekend, Rashad wakes up in the hospital with a broken nose and ribs and is told he needs to stay there so the doctors can monitor his internal bleeding. Rashad’s father questions whether Rashad was presenting himself in a way that made him seem dangerous, while Spoony is outraged at the situation. The local news obtains footage of Paul beating Rashad and begins covering the story. The Galluzzo family decides to have a cookout on Sunday, which Quinn and Jill both find strange. Quinn and Jill talk at the cookout about what Paul did to Rashad, while Paul and Guzzo try to intimidate Quinn into not saying anything about what he saw.
At school that week, everyone is talking about what happened to Rashad. Quinn feels conflicted as he has only ever seen the good side of Paul and doesn’t know Rashad. On Tuesday, someone has painted graffiti on the sidewalk in front of the school that says, “Rashad is absent again today.” This message creates a division in the school between those who believe Rashad was innocent and those who believe Paul was just doing his job. When Rashad sees a picture of the graffiti, he knows it is Carlos’s work. 
Spoony and his girlfriend, Berry, plan a protest that coming Friday against the police department. Guzzo continues to question Quinn’s loyalty. At first, Quinn wants to believe that Paul was just trying to do his job, but he just can’t forget what he saw outside Jerry’s. On Thursday, Quinn wears a shirt to school that says, “I’m marching. Are you?” The coach of the basketball team tells the players not to go to the protest and tells Quinn he will call his mother to tell her about his shirt. Quinn’s mother confronts him about the protest, and Quinn says he is standing up for what he believes in, just as his father would have done.
The doctor releases Rashad from the hospital on Thursday, and Rashad plans on joining the protest the following day. On Friday morning, Rashad and Quinn both feel nervous about the protest. Quinn sees a tank-like police vehicle headed toward the school and worries about the protesters’ safety. However, after talking with Jill, he understands that Black people live in fear of police violence every day and that they should put themselves at risk for one day to speak out against this reality. Rashad and Quinn, along with an enormous crowd, march from Jerry’s Corner Mart to the police department, where they stage a die-in as Berry reads aloud the names of unarmed Black people killed by police officers. Rashad and Quinn notice each other during the die-in and feel a connection as they both think of the people on the list and how they will keep fighting for them."
Based,"In “moon,” the first of the four parts of feed, an American teenager named Titus travels to the lunar surface with his high-school friends for spring break, hoping to escape the boredom they feel on Earth. No specific date is revealed, though it’s sometime in a dystopic future, where the moon is fully commercialized and people suffer from red sores called lesions. As Titus and his fellow upper-class friends Link, Marty, Calista, Loga, and Quendy arrive on the moon, readers also get their first glimpse of “the feed.” Although Titus doesn’t initially reveal exact details about the feed or how it works, he says it sends the friends ads and images for where to stay and shop. 
After failing to get into college-age parties, the group visits the Ricochet Lounge, where Titus becomes infatuated with a girl named Violet. She is beautiful and, he soon finds, visiting the moon by herself and is very unlike his friends: She doesn’t make pointless purchases at a mall they all soon visit and isn’t interested in malfunctioning, or falling into a drug-like stupor, via their connections to the feed. Later, when they all visit a dance club called the Rumble Spot, an old man from a dissenter group called the Coalition of Pity hacks into people’s individual feeds, causing them to broadcast the signal, “we enter a time of calamity” over the feed’s network. Police beat the man and “shut off” those hacked, including Titus and Violet, who hold hands as they collapse.
Part 2, “eden,” occurs in a lunar hospital where Violet, Titus, and his friends remain disconnected from the feed until their systems can be scanned for viruses. There, Titus provides additional details about what the feed is and how it works. Feeds are implanted inside the body and connect to a global network that provides news, entertainment, and a means to purchase every kind of product, he says while singing its praises. The feed even anticipates and creates users’ wants from individual profiles based on purchasing decisions, thoughts, and feelings. Titus and Violet grow closer during the stay. Violet, who’s home-schooled and smarter than Titus and his friends, says she hoped to enjoy herself like normal kids but now has a problem, though she remains vague about what this problem is. When doctors finally restore the friends’ feeds, they rejoice. Promotions begin to flow through their minds again, though there’s also ominous news concerning protests over America’s annexation of the moon and resulting anger from a group called the Global Alliance. Still, Titus says, the friends exalt in the return of their feeds.
In Part 3, “Utopia,” Titus and his friends return to Earth and life returns to normal for them: “upcars” travel in tubes past vertically stacked suburbs, the friends party, and U.S. President Trumbull scoffs at reports that claim toxic industries cause lesions. In defiance of rampant consumerism and a loss of individuality, Violet determines to resist the feed by creating a completely random customer profile and asks Titus to join her. Violet, who didn’t receive her feed until she was seven, voices deep concern about the decline of the world and destruction of Earth, and laments how those who’ve had the feed their entire lives are ignorant and self-centered. Titus soon has nightmares that are more likely hacks from the Coalition of Pity. In them, he sees disturbing images of eco destruction and human suffering around the world, but after Violet chats him, saying she has seen the images too, he only wants to go back to sleep.
Before long, Violet’s problem becomes clear: Her body begins to fail and she’s told by doctors that the damage to her feedware can be fatal. The prognosis makes Violet realize how much she wants to do. She starts by going to the seashore with Titus, though they need to dress in protective suits due to its toxicity. Meanwhile, feed chatter reveals that all of Earth’s forests have fallen and there is a growing rift between the U.S. and the Global Alliance. At a party where Quendy shows off her artificial lesions, Violet becomes outraged and her body falters. She chastises Titus and his friends for living in ignorance as the world dies, then collapses and is brought to the hospital. 
Violet’s condition declines further in Part 4, “slumberland,” whose chapter titles track her feed efficiency from a high of 87.3 percent to a low of 4.6 percent, 98 percent being optimal. Aware that she doesn’t have much time, Violet messages Titus a list of twenty-two things she wants to do in life, though he grows increasingly distant, and doesn’t message back. When they do reconnect, Violet sends Titus a recent memory where she falls down a staircase and receives a response from the corporation FeedTech, denying her petition to pay for her system repairs because she wasn’t deemed to be worthy due to her random customer profile. Violet later sends Titus childhood memories to preserve her history, though he deletes them. And when Violet convinces him to visit the mountains with her, one of her life goals, Titus breaks up with her, saying he was only interested in a short relationship while she wanted something eternal. 
Time passes and Titus eventually hears from Violet’s father. At Violet’s home, Titus sees her lying on a floating bed, completely pale, fully incapacitated, and covered in discs. Her father details her final, painful days and how her body failed. He then berates Titus for how badly he treated Violet and for willfully living in ignorance. Titus later visits Violet’s home a second time. Although she appears dead, her feed efficiency is at 4.6 percent and a screen shows that her heart is beating slightly. Nevertheless, Titus tells Violet a story he plans to keep telling her, he says, so she will remember herself. The story is about Violet, the end of America, and their relationship, where they learn something important about love and how to resist the feed. The book ends with a promotion on the feed for Blue-Jean Warehouse’s Final Sales Event and a recurring, fading message that “Everything must go.”"
On,"In the midst of a raging war, a plane evacuating a group of schoolboys from Britain is shot down over a deserted tropical island. Two of the boys, Ralph and Piggy, discover a conch shell on the beach, and Piggy realizes it could be used as a horn to summon the other boys. Once assembled, the boys set about electing a leader and devising a way to be rescued. They choose Ralph as their leader, and Ralph appoints another boy, Jack, to be in charge of the boys who will hunt food for the entire group.
Ralph, Jack, and another boy, Simon, set off on an expedition to explore the island. When they return, Ralph declares that they must light a signal fire to attract the attention of passing ships. The boys succeed in igniting some dead wood by focusing sunlight through the lenses of Piggy’s eyeglasses. However, the boys pay more attention to playing than to monitoring the fire, and the flames quickly engulf the forest. A large swath of dead wood burns out of control, and one of the youngest boys in the group disappears, presumably having burned to death.
At first, the boys enjoy their life without grown-ups and spend much of their time splashing in the water and playing games. Ralph, however, complains that they should be maintaining the signal fire and building huts for shelter. The hunters fail in their attempt to catch a wild pig, but their leader, Jack, becomes increasingly preoccupied with the act of hunting.
When a ship passes by on the horizon one day, Ralph and Piggy notice, to their horror, that the signal fire—which had been the hunters’ responsibility to maintain—has burned out. Furious, Ralph accosts Jack, but the hunter has just returned with his first kill, and all the hunters seem gripped with a strange frenzy, reenacting the chase in a kind of wild dance. Piggy criticizes Jack, who hits Piggy across the face. Ralph blows the conch shell and reprimands the boys in a speech intended to restore order. At the meeting, it quickly becomes clear that some of the boys have started to become afraid. The littlest boys, known as “littluns,” have been troubled by nightmares from the beginning, and more and more boys now believe that there is some sort of beast or monster lurking on the island. The older boys try to convince the others at the meeting to think rationally, asking where such a monster could possibly hide during the daytime. One of the littluns suggests that it hides in the sea—a proposition that terrifies the entire group.
Not long after the meeting, some military planes engage in a battle high above the island. The boys, asleep below, do not notice the flashing lights and explosions in the clouds. A parachutist drifts to earth on the signal-fire mountain, dead. Sam and Eric, the twins responsible for watching the fire at night, are asleep and do not see the parachutist land. When the twins wake up, they see the enormous silhouette of his parachute and hear the strange flapping noises it makes. Thinking the island beast is at hand, they rush back to the camp in terror and report that the beast has attacked them.
The boys organize a hunting expedition to search for the monster. Jack and Ralph, who are increasingly at odds, travel up the mountain. They see the silhouette of the parachute from a distance and think that it looks like a huge, deformed ape. The group holds a meeting at which Jack and Ralph tell the others of the sighting. Jack says that Ralph is a coward and that he should be removed from office, but the other boys refuse to vote Ralph out of power. Jack angrily runs away down the beach, calling all the hunters to join him. Ralph rallies the remaining boys to build a new signal fire, this time on the beach rather than on the mountain. They obey, but before they have finished the task, most of them have slipped away to join Jack.
Jack declares himself the leader of the new tribe of hunters and organizes a hunt and a violent, ritual slaughter of a sow to solemnize the occasion. The hunters then decapitate the sow and place its head on a sharpened stake in the jungle as an offering to the beast. Later, encountering the bloody, fly-covered head, Simon has a terrible vision, during which it seems to him that the head is speaking. The voice, which he imagines as belonging to the Lord of the Flies, says that Simon will never escape him, for he exists within all men. Simon faints. When he wakes up, he goes to the mountain, where he sees the dead parachutist. Understanding then that the beast does not exist externally but rather within each individual boy, Simon travels to the beach to tell the others what he has seen. But the others are in the midst of a chaotic revelry—even Ralph and Piggy have joined Jack’s feast—and when they see Simon’s shadowy figure emerge from the jungle, they fall upon him and kill him with their bare hands and teeth.
The following morning, Ralph and Piggy discuss what they have done. Jack’s hunters attack them and their few followers and steal Piggy’s glasses in the process. Ralph’s group travels to Jack’s stronghold in an attempt to make Jack see reason, but Jack orders Sam and Eric tied up and fights with Ralph. In the ensuing battle, one boy, Roger, rolls a boulder down the mountain, killing Piggy and shattering the conch shell. Ralph barely manages to escape a torrent of spears.
Ralph hides for the rest of the night and the following day, while the others hunt him like an animal. Jack has the other boys ignite the forest in order to smoke Ralph out of his hiding place. Ralph stays in the forest, where he discovers and destroys the sow’s head, but eventually, he is forced out onto the beach, where he knows the other boys will soon arrive to kill him. Ralph collapses in exhaustion, but when he looks up, he sees a British naval officer standing over him. The officer’s ship noticed the fire raging in the jungle. The other boys reach the beach and stop in their tracks at the sight of the officer. Amazed at the spectacle of this group of bloodthirsty, savage children, the officer asks Ralph to explain. Ralph is overwhelmed by the knowledge that he is safe but, thinking about what has happened on the island, he begins to weep. The other boys begin to sob as well. The officer turns his back so that the boys may regain their composure."
Heeded,"In Outliers: The Story of Success, Malcolm Gladwell considers the circumstances that lead to success. The first half of the book looks closely at how opportunities matter more in the lives of successful people than hard work or raw talent. The second half of the book focuses on cultural legacies: behavioral tendencies rooted in their ancestral past.
Part One examines the role of opportunity in the lives of extremely successful people. Gladwell’s first example is the Canadian Hockey League, the world’s most competitive youth hockey league. Since the cutoff date for the Canadian leagues that serve the youngest players is January 1, those born in the first part of the calendar year are much larger and more coordinated than their peers. The larger and more coordinated kids are given more playing time and better coaching, and thus become better players by the time they reach the top league. An overwhelming majority of Canadian professional hockey players have birthdays in January, February or March.
Gladwell proposes that 10,000 hours of practice is needed to master a skill, even for prodigies like Mozart. Bill Joy, Bill Gates, and the Beatles all worked hard to achieve success but benefited from opportunities they did not create. Joy, one of the founders of Sun Microsystems, happened to attend one of the first colleges in the world with a time-sharing terminal. In graduate school, he had a terminal in his room, where he spent all of his free time programming. Gates happened to attend a private high school with a time-sharing terminal connected to a mainframe in Seattle. He also was able to spend all of his free time programming. Early on, the Beatles were hired to play long shows day after day in Hamburg, Germany. 
Birth year or era is another form of opportunity. Gates and Joy (as well as other early programmers) all reached the end of their teen years just as personal computers became available to the public. In another example, fourteen of the top seventy-five richest people in the history of the world happened to be alive at the same time, in the same country: the United States in the mid-1800s.
Opportunity matters more than an individual’s IQ. Using a study conducted by Lewis Terman, the creator of the Stanford-Binet IQ test, Gladwell shows that “practical intelligence” is as important as “analytical intelligence.” He also contrasts Chris Langan, one of the world’s smartest living people, with Robert Oppenheimer. While both had difficulties in college, only Oppenheimer had a successful life, due to his practical intelligence.
The last portion of Part One looks at Joe Flom, a successful lawyer from New York City. While he was born into a poor family to Jewish immigrants (in a time when Jewish immigrants were not treated well), many of the disadvantages in his life were actually benefits and directly contributed to his success.
Part Two investigates cultural legacies. Using flight recorder transcripts from several plane crashes from the last few decades, Gladwell shows that cultural expectations and habits can be a severe hindrance to pilots. Copilots from countries that have a high “Power Distance Index” (those that show the most deference to authority) will often avoid telling pilots that they are making mistakes, even when the mistakes are potentially fatal. After recognizing the dangers of such cultural expectations, commercial aviation has instituted programs to change the way flight crews talk with one another. 
Gladwell next analyzes the disparity in public school math test scores between Eastern and Western countries. He suggests that the cultures in which rice paddy farming is historically important have a stronger work ethic. Using various examples, Gladwell shows that hard work has a greater impact on success in learning mathematics than intelligence. 
The final example is an examination of the KIPP school in the South Bronx and the “achievement gap” between socioeconomic groups. American students from middle-class and affluent households retain more information over summer vacation and are more likely to make additional gains than students from low-income households. The KIPP school uses longer school days and summer programming to eliminate the achievement gap for low-income children. While the work schedule is very rigorous, the school’s students go on to great academic success.
Gladwell demonstrates that if more opportunities were available, there would be far more successful people and the world would be richer for it."
Across,"Jethro Creighton, the protagonist, is young and idealistic when the Civil War begins. At first he thinks the war will be neat, full of marching soldiers and demonstrative patriotism. He learns the realities of war soon enough as he watches his three brothers, his cousin, and his teacher go off to fight. One of his brothers, Bill, chooses to fight for the South in a decision that plagues him for a long time. Jethro and his family follow the progress of the war through the newspapers, but it is hard to tell exactly what is happening. Each day the paper is full of praise or criticism for one of the Union generals, and Jethro has trouble sorting out what is actually going on.
One day Jethro's parents ask him to take the team of horses fifteen miles into town to get supplies. Jethro, excited to prove his responsibility, goes to town, makes his purchases, and then talks to some men at the store. One of the men asks Jethro about Bill and gets angry at the prospect of Bill's betrayal. Jethro stands by Bill, and, later, the editor of the town paper, Ross Milton, takes Jethro to lunch to apologize. Milton and Jethro begin a friendship that lasts throughout the book.
On the way home, Jethro is stopped by Mr. Burdow, the father of the boy who killed Jethro's sister, Mary. Mr. Burdow rides with Jethro for a while, and initially Jethro is scared, but Mr. Burdow explains that he thinks one of the men from the store is waiting for Jethro down the road. They encounter the man, and Mr. Burdow is able to prevent him from hurting Jethro. Jethro makes it home and tells his family about the encounter.
The men from the store begin to haunt the Creightons, eventually burning down their barn and putting oil in their well. The Creightons become sleepless and scared that the men will take further retribution. One day, a boy who is on leave from the war for an injury comes to the Creightons to tell them that their son Tom is dead. While the Creightons mourn, Ross Milton writes a letter in the paper to the men that have been tormenting them, saying that regardless of Bill's decisions the Creightons have sacrificed and lost enough. The attacks stop.
Not long after, Matt, Jethro's father, has a heart attack that renders him unable to work the field. Jenny and Jethro assume that responsibility together. Meanwhile, the war goes back and forth, with reports indicating no clear victors overall. The only concrete information they glean from the paper is the atrocious death toll.
One day while working the fields, Jethro hears a sound in the woods. He investigates and finds his cousin Eb, who has deserted the war. Eb says that he could not continue fighting—the conditions were horrible, and the soldiers did not believe they could win the war. Jethro, unsure about what to do, sneaks food and blankets to Eb but does not tell the rest of the family, who are subject to penalties for housing a deserter. He writes to President Lincoln to ask for advice, and Lincoln responds by telling Jethro that he, too, has been plagued with that problem and has decided to grant amnesty to the deserters who return to their post by a certain time.
Word comes that Shadrach, Jethro's teacher, has been critically injured during a battle, and Jenny and Ross Milton leave for Washington D.C. so that Jenny can see Shadrach for one last time. Eventually, she is able to nurse Shadrach back to health, and Matt gives his consent for the two to marry.
Meanwhile, the Union army plunders the South, as General Sherman leads troops north from Savannah, ransacking and devastating farms and homesteads along the way. He soon joins forces with Grant, and they are able to cut off supplies to the Confederate Army. The Confederate Army surrenders.
Just when it seems that, with the war over, life is going to return to a state of security, President Lincoln is assassinated. His murder leaves Jethro bereft, and nothing is able to soothe him. Shadrach returns and tells Jethro that Jethro is going to move in with him and Jenny so that Jethro can continue his studies."
Heirs,"A sixty-two-year-old delivery boy, Otis Amber, delivers six letters to people handpicked to live in a luxurious new apartment building called Sunset Towers. The man who signed the letters, Barney Northrup, doesn’t actually exist. Despite that fact, a man calling himself Barney Northrup shows all the prospective tenants the apartments, and by the end of the day, he has rented them all. The new tenants come from different walks of life and include several families with children as well as single people. Included in the apartment community are the doorman, the in-house cleaning woman, and Otis, who makes many deliveries to the buildings.
Two months after the tenants move in, everyone except Sydelle Pulaski notices an unexpected occurrence: Smoke rises from the chimney of the nearby deserted Westing mansion. Sam Westing, who owns the Westing Paper Plant, disappeared thirteen years ago, though some people believe his corpse still lies in the house. Sandy, Sunset Towers’ doorman, tells Otis, Turtle Wexler, Theo Theodorakis, and Doug Hoo a scary story of two kids who went into the Westing house one year ago and ran out like they saw a ghost. Turtle, a junior-high-school student and budding businesswoman, offers to sneak into the house for money. In the eleven minutes she remains inside the house, she sees a waxy-looking man, believed to be Sam Westing, lying in his bed, seemingly dead.
News of Sam Westing’s death hits the newspaper. Westing was an industrialist who had built his own business and died a multimillionaire, alone—his adult daughter had drowned, and his wife had left him. Years ago, Westing had been in a serious car accident, and he had not been seen again until he showed up dead in his house. The following day, Otis delivers letters to sixteen of the tenants in Sunset Towers, which state that they are Westing’s heirs and invite them to the reading of his will.
The tenants assemble at Westing’s mansion. Grace Wexler, mother to Angela and Turtle, arrives first. James Hoo, owner of a fancy restaurant, comes with his son Doug, a high school track star. Theo and Chris Theodorakis also arrive; Theo is in high school, and Chris is his younger brother who suffers an unknown neurological condition. Also among Westing’s heirs are Dr. Denton Deere, Angela’s fiancé; Flora Baumbach, an older seamstress; Judge J. J. Ford, the first Black and female judge in the state who has past ties to Westing; and Sydelle, who has no apparent connection to Westing. Westing’s other heirs are Berthe Crow, the cleaning woman; Otis; and Sandy.
The reading of Westing’s will reveals that one of the heirs has taken Westing’s life. The heir who solves the mystery will inherit Westing’s millions. Heirs are grouped into two-person teams and receive clue words. However, the will instructs the heirs that it’s what they don’t have that matters. The teams all work to understand what their clues mean but with little success. Everyone is friendly with Sydelle because she took shorthand notes at the reading of the will. Judge Ford, partnering with Sandy, even hires a private investigator to find out information about the other heirs and their possible connections to Westing.
In the midst of the heirs working out the puzzle, a bomber strikes. The first bomb goes off in the coffee shop owned by Chris and Theo’s family when the heirs are meeting to discuss sharing clues. Later that evening, a second bomb explodes in Mr. Hoo’s restaurant, injuring Sydelle, who is taken to the hospital. Sandy and Judge Ford continue organizing facts about the heirs. They learn that Westing’s daughter Violet was childhood sweethearts with Mr. Theodorakis but committed suicide when her mother wanted her to marry a politician. Later, a third bomb goes off at Angela’s wedding shower, making a deep cut in her cheek and sending her to the hospital. Turtle figures out that Angela set the bombs herself.
As Judge Ford and Sandy keep studying their notes, they see a possible connection between Grace, who claims to be Westing’s niece, and Crow. They decide that Westing is not dead but wants revenge on his estranged wife, who must be Crow, for Violet’s suicide. Judge Ford and Sandy also have ties to Westing, however: Judge Ford grew up in the Westing mansion, where her parents worked, and Westing paid for her education; Sandy worked at the Westing Paper Plant but was fired.
When a fourth bomb goes off in the elevator in Sunset Towers, the heirs are summoned back to the Westing mansion. Now Westing’s lawyer asks each heir to provide the name of the person who took Westing’s life. No one is correct, but when they pool their clues together, they almost have all the words to the song “America, the Beautiful.” The missing word parts spell out Crow’s name. Suddenly, Sandy falls to the floor and dies. The lawyer returns and declares that they have just five minutes to give the right name and claim the millions. No one wants to name Crow as a murderer, but she gives her own name and is arrested.
Back at Sunset Towers, Turtle holds a fake trial. She’s been putting together ideas from the clues, the will, and the events. She says that Westing and Sandy are dead, but Crow did not kill them. Through questioning and explanations, she proves that Westing disguised himself as Sandy but that he also had three other identities, one of which she keeps a secret. Crow enters the room with Westing’s lawyer, having been declared innocent since Sandy died of a heart attack, and the lawyer hands over the final page of the will, which gives them all ownership of Sunset Towers and money to Crow. The next day, Turtle goes to the home of the Westing Paper Plant’s CEO, calls him Sandy, and announces that she won the game.
Turtle never tells anyone else about Sandy, whom she visits every week. Crow and Otis get married, and all the other tenants achieve their dreams. Turtle and Sandy remain friends for many years, and she sits with him at his deathbed. By then she has married Theo and become a successful, rich businesswoman. She inherits Sandy’s estate and becomes director of the paper company."
Forebears,"N. Scott Momaday, a poet and novelist of Kiowa descent, learns that his grandmother, Aho, has died. She is buried near Rainy Mountain, Oklahoma, and Momaday wants to visit her grave. He decides to make the journey the long way—by following the ancient migration route of the Kiowas, from their original homeland near the headwaters of the Yellowstone River east to the Black Hills and then south to Oklahoma. During this migration, the Kiowas had acquired horses and the Sun Dance religion. Their warrior society once dominated the southern Great Plains. 
As Momaday follows his ancestors’ journey, he recounts oral histories passed on to him by his parents and grandparents. He collects pieces of historical information, records his own impressions and memories, and composes poems. He arranges these diverse materials to form a narrative wheel, in which the voice of Kiowa oral tradition, the voice of historical commentary, and the personal voice of the author take turns telling stories of multiple journeys that form a single journey of the human spirit. Paintings by Al Momaday, the author’s father, illustrate key scenes from the Kiowas’ oral history.
The voice of oral tradition begins with the myth of how Kiowas enter the world through a hollow log. Although they must leave many of their people behind, they are happy with what they see. Sometime later, two of their chiefs argue over the udders of an antelope. One chief gets so angry that he takes his followers and leaves, never to be seen again. A talking dog agrees to help a man escape his enemies, and in return the man cares for her puppies.
A Kiowa woman hangs a little girl’s cradle in a tree. A redbird lures the child out of her cradle. As the girl climbs after the bird, the tree grows and carries her to the sky. There the sun is waiting to make her his wife. The girl weds the sun and has a child. Later, after arguing with her husband, the woman lowers a rope and climbs down, trying to reach her people. The angry sun throws a ring and kills his wife, leaving the child alone. A grandmother spider ensnares the sun’s child, a little boy, and raises him as her own son. The sun’s child keeps the ring that killed his mother. He tosses the ring toward the sky. The ring falls on him and splits him in two. Now grandmother spider must raise twins. She teaches them a sacred word that helps them escape evil giants. Then the twins kill a snake without realizing he is their grandfather. Heartbroken, the grandmother spider dies, but the twins live on for a long time.
The Kiowas suffer hard times, when food is scarce. A man is out looking for food when Tai-me (the sacred Sun Dance doll) appears, covered with feathers. She promises to give the Kiowas whatever they want. From this time on she will belong to the Kiowas. Another legend tells of two brothers who receive a mysterious gift of meat during a hungry winter. While one brother feels afraid of the meat, the other brother eats it and is transformed into a water beast.
Kiowa storytellers recite newer legends about their forebears and their life on the plains. They tell of a woman who saves her family by throwing hot grease at her enemies and of a skilled arrow maker who shoots his enemy right in the heart. They speak of how horses came to be and of terrible winds and storms. The elders relive the love story of the great warrior Quoetotai and one of the wives of Many Bears. They celebrate a buffalo with horns of steel—and the hunter who kills him with one last perfect shot. One tale relates what happens to a wife who abandons her husband. Another tale tells of some young men who ride south to find the homeland of the sun and of the spooky events that made them return to their homes and their life of hunting buffalo.
The Kiowas also tell of two brothers who are captured by the Utes. The Ute chief offers freedom if one brother can carry the other over a path of greased buffalo heads. The Kiowa hero accomplishes the task. The elders also tell how a great horse dies of shame after its hunter shows fear.
The Kiowas recite stories about Mammedaty, the grandson of Guipahgo. Mammedaty has visions, such as his vision of a child in the grass. He also has a bad temper—he shoots a horse in anger. Aho, Momaday’s grandmother, joins the voices of the elders. She tells of the time the Tai-me bundle fell to the floor with a great noise. Momaday, the author, adds the tale of a beautifully dressed woman buried somewhere near the house of Mammedaty, his grandfather.
Momaday adds historical comments after each story in the Kiowas’ oral history. He explains that the name Kiowa contains the meaning of two different halves. Momaday describes Kiowa traditional dress, their hunting practices, their “dog societies” of skilled warriors, their skill with horses, their Sun Dance ceremony, which was centered on the sacred doll Tai-me, and their later peyote rituals. He also records key events in the decline and destruction of the Kiowas and their culture.
Momaday also adds comments in his own voice after each Kiowa story and historical comment. He describes the land and its living things—wildflowers, insects, and spiders—in intimate detail and records how places make him feel. Momaday adds memories of his grandmother, Aho; of his grandfather, Mammedaty; and of Mammedaty’s grandmother and other elders. He shares a final oral memory from Ko-sahn, a one-hundred-year-old woman. Ko-sahn remembers how, in her childhood, she helped get the lodge ready for the Sun Dance, how an old woman sprinkled special earth on the lodge floor, and how beautiful it was to watch the Sun Dance, which was all for Tai-me."
1817,"Frederick Douglass was born into slavery sometime in 1817 or 1818. Like many enslaved people, he is unsure of his exact date of birth. Douglass is separated from his mother, Harriet Bailey, soon after he is born. His father is most likely their white master, Captain Anthony. Captain Anthony is the clerk of a rich man named Colonel Lloyd. Lloyd enslaves hundreds of men, women, and children, who call his large, central plantation the “Great House Farm.” Life on any of Lloyd’s plantations, like that on many Southern plantations, is brutal. Those enslaved are overworked and exhausted, receive little food, few articles of clothing, and no beds. Those who break rules—and even those who do not—are beaten or whipped, and sometimes even shot by the plantation overseers, the cruelest of which are Mr. Severe and Mr. Austin Gore. 
Douglass’s life on this plantation is not as hard as that of most of the others. Being a child, he serves in the household instead of in the fields. At the age of seven, he is given to Captain Anthony’s son‑in‑law’s brother, Hugh Auld, who lives in Baltimore. In Baltimore, Douglass enjoys a relatively freer life. In general, city slave-owners are more conscious of appearing cruel or neglectful toward those they enslave in front of their non‑slaveowning neighbors.
Sophia Auld, Hugh’s wife, has never ""owned"" enslaved people before, and therefore she is surprisingly kind to Douglass at first. She even begins to teach Douglass to read, until her husband orders her to stop, saying that education makes enslaved people unmanageable. Eventually, Sophia succumbs to the mentality of slaveowning and loses her natural kindliness. Though Sophia and Hugh Auld become crueler toward him, Douglass still likes Baltimore and is able to teach himself to read with the help of local boys. As he learns to read and write, Douglass becomes conscious of the evils of slavery and of the existence of the abolitionist, or antislavery, movement. He resolves to escape to the North eventually.
After the deaths of Captain Anthony and his remaining heirs, Douglass is taken back to serve Thomas Auld, Captain Anthony’s son‑in‑law. Auld is a mean man made harsher by his false religious piety. Auld considers Douglass unmanageable, so Auld rents him for one year to Edward Covey, a man known for “breaking” enslaved people. Covey manages, in the first six months, to work and whip all the spirit out of Douglass. Douglass becomes a brutish man, no longer interested in reading or freedom, capable only of resting from his injuries and exhaustion. The turning point comes when Douglass resolves to fight back against Covey. The two men have a two‑hour fight, after which Covey never touches Douglass again.
His year with Covey over, Douglass is next rented to William Freeland for two years. Though Freeland is a milder, fairer man, Douglass’s will to escape is nonetheless renewed. At Freeland’s, Douglass begins educating his fellow enslaved people in a Sabbath school at the homes of free Black people. Despite the threat of punishment and violence they face, many enslaved people from neighboring farms come to Douglass and work diligently to learn. At Freeland’s, Douglass also forms a plan of escape with three fellow enslaved men with whom he is close. Someone betrays their plan to Freeland, however, and Douglass and the others are taken to jail. Thomas Auld then sends Douglass back to Baltimore with Hugh Auld, to learn the trade of ship caulking.
In Baltimore’s trade industry, Douglass runs up against strained race relations. White workers have been working alongside free Black workers, but the whites have begun to fear that the increasing numbers of free Black people will take their jobs. Though only an apprentice and still enslaved, Douglass encounters violent tactics of intimidation from his white coworkers and is forced to switch shipyards. In his new apprenticeship, Douglass quickly learns the trade of caulking and soon earns the highest wages possible, always turning them over to Hugh Auld.
Eventually, Douglass receives permission from Hugh Auld to hire out his extra time. He saves money bit by bit and eventually makes his escape to New York. Douglass refrains from describing the details of his escape in order to protect the safety of future slaves who may attempt the journey. In New York, Douglass fears recapture and changes his name from Bailey to Douglass. Soon after, he marries Anna Murray, a free woman he met while in Baltimore. They move north to Massachusetts, where Douglass becomes deeply engaged with the abolitionist movement as both a writer and an orator."
Loudly,"Two migrant workers, George and Lennie, have been let off a bus miles away from the California farm where they are due to start work. George is a small, dark man with “sharp, strong features.” Lennie, his companion, is his opposite, a giant of a man with a “shapeless” face. Overcome with thirst, the two stop in a clearing by a pool and decide to camp for the night. As the two converse, it becomes clear that Lennie has an intellectual disability, and is deeply devoted to George and dependent upon him for protection and guidance. George finds that Lennie, who loves petting soft things but often accidentally kills them, has been carrying and stroking a dead mouse. George angrily throws it away, fearing that Lennie might catch a disease from the dead animal. George complains loudly that his life would be easier without having to care for Lennie, but the reader senses that their friendship and devotion is mutual. He and Lennie share a dream of buying their own piece of land, farming it, and, much to Lennie’s delight, keeping rabbits. George ends the night by treating Lennie to the story he often tells him about what life will be like in such an idyllic place.
The next day, the men report to the nearby ranch. George, fearing how the boss will react to Lennie, insists that he’ll do all the talking. He lies, explaining that they travel together because they are cousins and that a horse kicked Lennie in the head when he was a child. They are hired. They meet Candy, an old “swamper,” or handyman, with a missing hand and an ancient dog, and Curley, the boss’s mean-spirited son. Curley is newly married, possessive of his flirtatious wife, and full of jealous suspicion. Once George and Lennie are alone in the bunkhouse, Curley’s wife appears and flirts with them. Lennie thinks she is “purty,” but George, sensing the trouble that could come from tangling with this woman and her husband, warns Lennie to stay away from her. Soon, the ranch-hands return from the fields for lunch, and George and Lennie meet Slim, the skilled mule driver who wields great authority on the ranch. Slim comments on the rarity of friendship like that between George and Lennie. Carlson, another ranch-hand, suggests that since Slim’s dog has just given birth, they should offer a puppy to Candy and shoot Candy’s old, good-for-nothing dog.
The next day, George confides in Slim that he and Lennie are not cousins, but have been friends since childhood. He tells how Lennie has often gotten them into trouble. For instance, they were forced to flee their last job because Lennie tried to touch a woman’s dress and was accused of rape. Slim agrees to give Lennie one of his puppies, and Carlson continues to badger Candy to kill his old dog. When Slim agrees with Carlson, saying that death would be a welcome relief to the suffering animal, Candy gives in. Carlson, before leading the dog outside, promises to do the job painlessly.
Slim goes to the barn to do some work, and Curley, who is maniacally searching for his wife, heads to the barn to accost Slim. Candy overhears George and Lennie discussing their plans to buy land, and offers his life’s savings if they will let him live there too. The three make a pact to let no one else know of their plan. Slim returns to the bunkhouse, berating Curley for his suspicions. Curley, searching for an easy target for his anger, finds Lennie and picks a fight with him. Lennie crushes Curley’s hand in the altercation. Slim warns Curley that if he tries to get George and Lennie fired, he will be the laughingstock of the farm.
The next night, most of the men go to the local brothel. Lennie is left with Crooks, the lonely, Black stable-hand, and Candy. Curley’s wife flirts with them, refusing to leave until the other men come home. She notices the cuts on Lennie’s face and suspects that he, and not a piece of machinery as Curley claimed, is responsible for hurting her husband. This thought amuses her. The next day, Lennie accidentally kills his puppy in the barn. Curley’s wife enters and consoles him. She admits that life with Curley is a disappointment, and wishes that she had followed her dream of becoming a movie star. Lennie tells her that he loves petting soft things, and she offers to let him feel her hair. When he grabs too tightly, she cries out. In his attempt to silence her, he accidentally breaks her neck.
Lennie flees back to a pool of the Salinas River that George had designated as a meeting place should either of them get into trouble. As the men back at the ranch discover what has happened and gather together a lynch party, George joins Lennie. Much to Lennie’s surprise, George is not mad at him for doing “a bad thing.” George begins to tell Lennie the story of the farm they will have together. As he describes the rabbits that Lennie will tend, the sound of the approaching lynch party grows louder. George shoots his friend in the back of the head.
When the other men arrive, George lets them believe that Lennie had the gun, and George wrestled it away from him and shot him. Only Slim understands what has really happened, that George has killed his friend out of mercy. Slim consolingly leads him away, and the other men, completely puzzled, watch them leave."
Allow,"Nine years after the start of the Trojan War, the Greek (“Achaean”) army sacks Chryse, a town allied with Troy. During the battle, the Achaeans capture a pair of beautiful maidens, Chryseis and Briseis. Agamemnon, the leader of the Achaean forces, takes Chryseis as his prize, and Achilles, the Achaeans’ greatest warrior, claims Briseis. Chryseis’s father, Chryses, who serves as a priest of the god Apollo, offers an enormous ransom in return for his daughter, but Agamemnon refuses to give Chryseis back. Chryses then prays to Apollo, who sends a plague upon the Achaean camp.
After many Achaeans die, Agamemnon consults the prophet Calchas to determine the cause of the plague. When he learns that Chryseis is the cause, he reluctantly gives her up but then demands Briseis from Achilles as compensation. Furious at this insult, Achilles returns to his tent in the army camp and refuses to fight in the war any longer. He vengefully yearns to see the Achaeans destroyed and asks his mother, the sea-nymph Thetis, to enlist the services of Zeus, king of the gods, toward this end. The Trojan and Achaean sides have declared a cease-fire with each other, but now the Trojans breach the treaty and Zeus comes to their aid.
With Zeus supporting the Trojans and Achilles refusing to fight, the Achaeans suffer great losses. Several days of fierce conflict ensue, including duels between Paris and Menelaus and between Hector and Ajax. The Achaeans make no progress; even the heroism of the great Achaean warrior Diomedes proves fruitless. The Trojans push the Achaeans back, forcing them to take refuge behind the ramparts that protect their ships. The Achaeans begin to nurture some hope for the future when a nighttime reconnaissance mission by Diomedes and Odysseus yields information about the Trojans’ plans, but the next day brings disaster. Several Achaean commanders become wounded, and the Trojans break through the Achaean ramparts. They advance all the way up to the boundary of the Achaean camp and set fire to one of the ships. Defeat seems imminent, because without the ships, the army will be stranded at Troy and almost certainly destroyed.
Concerned for his comrades but still too proud to help them himself, Achilles agrees to a plan proposed by Nestor that will allow his beloved friend Patroclus to take his place in battle, wearing his armor. Patroclus is a fine warrior, and his presence on the battlefield helps the Achaeans push the Trojans away from the ships and back to the city walls. But the counterattack soon falters. Apollo knocks Patroclus’s armor to the ground, and Hector slays him. Fighting then breaks out as both sides try to lay claim to the body and armor. Hector ends up with the armor, but the Achaeans, thanks to a courageous effort by Menelaus and others, manage to bring the body back to their camp. When Achilles discovers that Hector has killed Patroclus, he fills with such grief and rage that he agrees to reconcile with Agamemnon and rejoin the battle. Thetis goes to Mount Olympus and persuades the god Hephaestus to forge Achilles a new suit of armor, which she presents to him the next morning. Achilles then rides out to battle at the head of the Achaean army.
Meanwhile, Hector, not expecting Achilles to rejoin the battle, has ordered his men to camp outside the walls of Troy. But when the Trojan army glimpses Achilles, it flees in terror back behind the city walls. Achilles cuts down every Trojan he sees. Strengthened by his rage, he even fights the god of the river Xanthus, who is angered that Achilles has caused so many corpses to fall into his streams. Finally, Achilles confronts Hector outside the walls of Troy. Ashamed at the poor advice that he gave his comrades, Hector refuses to flee inside the city with them. Achilles chases him around the city’s periphery three times, but the goddess Athena finally tricks Hector into turning around and fighting Achilles. In a dramatic duel, Achilles kills Hector. He then lashes the body to the back of his chariot and drags it across the battlefield to the Achaean camp. Upon Achilles’ arrival, the triumphant Achaeans celebrate Patroclus’s funeral with a long series of athletic games in his honor. Each day for the next nine days, Achilles drags Hector’s body in circles around Patroclus’s funeral bier.
At last, the gods agree that Hector deserves a proper burial. Zeus sends the god Hermes to escort King Priam, Hector’s father and the ruler of Troy, into the Achaean camp. Priam tearfully pleads with Achilles to take pity on a father bereft of his son and return Hector’s body. He invokes the memory of Achilles’ own father, Peleus. Deeply moved, Achilles finally relents and returns Hector’s corpse to the Trojans. Both sides agree to a temporary truce, and Hector receives a hero’s funeral."
Government,"In Common Sense, Thomas Paine argues for American independence. His argument begins with more general, theoretical reflections about government and religion, then progresses onto the specifics of the colonial situation.
Paine begins by distinguishing between government and society. Society, according to Paine, is everything constructive and good that people join together to accomplish. Government, on the other hand, is an institution whose sole purpose is to protect us from our own vices. Government has its origins in the evil of man and is therefore a necessary evil at best. Paine says that government's sole purpose is to protect life, liberty and property, and that a government should be judged solely on the basis of the extent to which it accomplishes this goal.
Paine then considers an imagined scenario in which a small group of people has been placed on an island, and cut off from the rest of society. In time, these people develop ties with one another, and lawmaking becomes inevitable. Paine says the people will be much happier if they are responsible for the creation of the laws that rule them. Paine is also implicitly arguing that such a system of representation is also better for the American colonists. Having expressed his disagreement with British reign in America, Paine proceeds to launch a general attack on the British system of government. Paine says the British system is too complex and rife with contradictions, and that the monarchy is granted far too much power. The British system pretends to offer a reasonable system of checks and balances, but in fact, it does not.
From here Paine moves on to discuss, in general, the notions of monarchy and hereditary succession. Man, Pain argues, was born into a state of equality, and the distinction that has arisen between king and subject is an unnatural one. At first, Paine says, the world was without kings, but the ancient Jews decided they wanted a king. This angered God, but he allowed them to have one. Paine presents pages of biblical evidence detailing God's wrath at the idea of the Jews having a king. The conclusion Paine reaches is that the practice of monarchy originates from sin, and is an institution that the Bible and God condemn. Paine calls hereditary succession an abominable practice. He says that even if people were to choose to have a king, that does not legitimize that King's child acting as a future ruler. Furthermore, hereditary succession has brought with it innumerable evils, such as incompetent kings, corruption, and civil war.
Having dispensed with the preliminary theoretical issues, Paine sets in to discuss the details of the American situation. In response to the argument that America has flourished under British rule, and therefore ought to stay under the king, Paine says that such an argument fails to realize that America has evolved and no longer needs Britain's help. Some say that Britain has protected America, and therefore deserves allegiance, but Paine responds that Britain has only watched over America in order to secure its own economic well-being. Paine adds that most recently, instead of watching over the colonies, the British have been attacking them, and are therefore undeserving of American loyalty.
Paine says that the colonies have little to gain from remaining attached to Britain. Commerce can be better conducted with the rest of Europe, but only after America becomes independent. Paine also asserts that if the colonies remain attached to Britain, the same problems that have arisen in the past will arise in the future. Paine argues that it is necessary to seek independence now, as to do otherwise would only briefly cover up problems that will surely reemerge.
Paine even proposes the form of government that the independent colonies should adopt. His recommendation is for a representative democracy that gives roughly equal weight to each of the colonies.
Paine explains why the current time is a good time to break free of Britain. Primarily, Paine focuses on the present size of the colonies, and on their current capabilities. He presents an inventory of the British Navy and gives calculations revealing how America could build a navy of comparable size. Paine recommends this as a way of ensuring America's security and prosperity in trade. Paine also argues that America is sufficiently small as to be united now. If time were to elapse, and the population of the colonies to grow, the same feeling of unity would not be present. Paine adds that if the Americans revolt now, they can use the vast expanses of uncharted land to the West in order to pay down some of the debt they will incur.
Paine says that as a colony of Britain, America lacks respectability on the international scene. They are seen simply as rebels, and cannot form substantial alliances with other nations. In order to prosper in the long term, the colonies need to be independent. Paine says that, by declaring independence, America will be able to ask for the help of other countries in its struggle for freedom. For all of these reasons, Paine says it is imperative and urgent that the colonies declare independence."
Prostitutes,"In Woman at Point Zero, Nawal El Saadawi describes her experiences as a psychiatrist in Egypt, studying the psychological effects of prison on female prisoners. She states in her introduction that when she was conducting these studies, she had no idea that one day she would be imprisoned by the government. On one visit to Qanatir prison, Nawal meets a doctor who tells her that there is a prisoner there who is truly remarkable. She is awaiting the death penalty for killing a man, but the doctor cannot believe that this woman is capable of killing anyone. He wrote out a request for a pardon, but the condemned woman refused to sign it. Nawal desperately wants to meet with this woman, named Firdaus, but Firdaus keeps refusing to meet with her. Finally, the day before she is to be put to death, Firdaus agrees to meet with Nawal.
Nawal goes to Firdaus's cell, and Firdaus commands her to sit on the ground. Firdaus begins to tell her life story. She was born into an extremely poor family in the countryside. Her father often beat her mother; sometimes he beat her as well. Firdaus used to play in the fields with other children. A boy named Mohammadain was her special playmate, and when they were young, they used to play “bride and bridegroom.” Firdaus got pleasure from her sexual experiments with Mohammadain. One day, her mother performed a clitoridectomy on her, and after that, Firdaus is no longer allowed to play with Mohammadain, nor does she ever feel sexual pleasure in the same way. Soon, Firdaus's mother and father die, and Firdaus is sent to live with her uncle, a scholar, who lives in Cairo.
At first, everything goes well for Firdaus in Cairo. She and her uncle get along well, and she is allowed to go to school, which she loves. She and her uncle share a bed and are close. Her uncle gets married and the new wife does not like Firdaus, so Firdaus is sent to a boarding school. Firdaus is an excellent student and works hard. Unlike the other girls, she does not fantasize about boys and marriage. She spends most of her time at the library and in the courtyard, where she encounters a teacher named Miss Iqbal, with whom she forms a friendship. When Firdaus graduates, she is given an award, but she and her family are not at the ceremony, so Miss Iqbal accepts it for Firdaus. When school is over, Firdaus's uncle comes to get her.
Back at her uncle's house, Firdaus is miserable. One night, she overhears her aunt and uncle discussing whether they will marry Firdaus to her aunt's old uncle, Sheikh Mahmoud. He is sixty and has a facial deformity. Firdaus runs away, but while she is on the streets, she is terrified by the strange men who approach her, so she returns home. They marry her to Sheikh Mahmoud. He is selfish and stingy and beats Firdaus. His facial deformity is a large swelling on his chin with a hole in the middle that leaks pus. After one bad beating, Firdaus runs away. She ends up in a coffee shop, where she meets Bayoumi, the coffee shop owner. She goes with him to his apartment. At first Bayoumi is kind to Firdaus. Then Firdaus announces that she wants to get a job, and Bayoumi is enraged. He beats her and begins to lock her in the apartment when he leaves. He brings his friends home and allows them to abuse and rape her. Firdaus escapes with the help of a neighbor and flees Bayoumi's apartment for the city.
Resting by the Nile, Firdaus feels hopeless until an wealthy-looking woman approaches her. Her name is Sharifa, and she is a prostitute. She takes Firdaus in and teaches her to become a high-class prostitute. Sharifa makes money from Firdaus's body until one night when her friend Fawzy comes over. Firdaus overhears Sharifa and Fawzy fighting over who will get to keep her, so she runs away again. Still a prostitute, Firdaus becomes her own boss and eventually has a beautiful home and expensive things. One night, a client named Di'aa tells her that she is not a respectable woman, and Firdaus is devastated. She gives up her nice apartment and beautiful things, moves into a shack, and begins working as an office assistant. There, she realizes that the life of an assistant is in many ways worse than the life of a prostitute. She meets a man named Ibrahim, and falls in love with him. They have a relationship, and Firdaus begins to feel that the world is not so horrible, until she discovers that Ibrahim has become engaged to the boss's daughter.
Firdaus leaves the company and becomes a prostitute again. She is very expensive and very popular. Many powerful men come to her, and she turns some of them away to prove that she has power over her own body, and because she despises them. Ibrahim comes to her, and she realizes he never loved her; rather, he just wanted free sex. A pimp tries to take over Firdaus's life, and for a little while, she lets him. Then they fight and she kills him. Shortly after that, Firdaus meets an Arab prince who takes her home and offers her $3,000. She sleeps with him, rips up the money, and slaps him. Terrified, the man calls the police. They come and arrest Firdaus. Firdaus is tried and sentenced to death.
She is, she tells Nawal, just waiting to die, because she is excited to go somewhere new. She knows that the men who sentenced her want to kill her because they're afraid of the truth she has to tell, not because they're afraid she'll kill again. After she finishes her story, police come to her cell and take her away to be executed. Nawal leaves the cell and is ashamed of the world. Everywhere she looks, she sees lies and unhappiness. As Nawal drives away from the prison, she thinks about running people over with her car, but she doesn't. She realizes that Firdaus is braver than she is."
Finding,"Looking for Alaska tells the story of Miles “Pudge” Halter, a high school junior who divides his life into time before and time after a life-changing event that the reader will not discover until later in the novel. 
Miles plans to attend the Culver Creek boarding school for his junior year of high school. Although his parents worry that Miles wants to attend the school because he does not have friends at his current school, Miles reveals that he is actually influenced by the last words of the poet François Rabelais about “seeking the Great Perhaps.” He moves to Birmingham, Alabama to attend Culver Creek and becomes friends with his roommate, Chip “The Colonel” Martin. Chip teaches Miles about the social structure of the school. He explains that the wealthy students that go home to their parents’ mansions every weekend (the “Weekday Warriors”) do not get along with his friend group. 
Chip introduces Miles to his friend Alaska, and Miles is quickly enamored by her. While Miles is obsessed with people’s final words and wants to seek François Rabelais’s “Great Perhaps,” Alaska enjoys books and wants to know the nature of “the labyrinth of suffering” that Simón Bolívar evoked in his final words.
The Weekday Warriors sneak into Chip and Miles’s dorm on Miles’s first night and throw Miles into the lake with his limbs bound by tape. Chip and Miles discover that this action was taken in retaliation for Chip supposedly ratting out their friends—a couple named Marya and Paul—and getting them expelled the previous year. Miles, Chip, Alaska, and another friend, Takumi, begin planning a revenge prank. Miles becomes part of their friend group and starts smoking cigarettes. The four of them get caught smoking and Alaska and Chip cover for Miles and Takumi, demonstrating to Miles that you cover for your friends instead of ratting them out. 
Miles settles into his new school and does well in his classes because he spends so much time studying. Alaska decides she will find Miles a girlfriend, and eventually introduces him to a Romanian student named Lara. Miles embarrasses himself on the first group date at a basketball game with Alaska, Alaska’s boyfriend Jake, Chip, Chip’s girlfriend Sara, Takumi, and Lara. Miles is hit by a basketball, gets concussed, and then vomits on Lara. Afterward, Miles tries to talk to Alaska, but is confused when Alaska becomes moody and short with him for no apparent reason.
The Weekday Warriors target Alaska with a prank, reminding Chip and Alaska they need to work on their own revenge prank. Takumi reveals to Miles that it was actually Alaska who ratted out the couple who were expelled the previous year. Takumi warns Miles that he cannot rat anyone else out if he gets caught carrying out the revenge prank. Miles is still infatuated with Alaska and asks his parents to let him stay at school over Thanksgiving break so he can be with her. Although he knows she has a boyfriend, Miles wants to be with Alaska. They ultimately spend Thanksgiving Day with Chip and his mom.
Lara joins Alaska, Chip, Takumi, and Miles as they execute their revenge prank on the Weekday Warriors. They set off fireworks and put dye in the Weekday Warriors’ hair products. They also get on the computer of the Dean (whom they call “the Eagle”) to send bad grade reports to the parents of the Weekday Warriors. The five of them spend the remainder of the night and weekend camping and hiding in a barn on campus as their alibi is that they were all off campus. They play a drinking game and Alaska reveals that, as a child, she saw her mom die of an aneurysm and did not call an ambulance because she thought her mom was just sleeping. When they quit playing the drinking game, Miles kisses Lara. He asks if she wants to be his girlfriend and she says yes. 
Miles spends time with Lara despite not having much to talk about, but they are physically intimate. He leaves Lara to spend time with Alaska and Chip in his room, watching them as they get drunk. Alaska dares Miles to make out with her. He does and she tells him it is to be continued in the future. They all go to sleep. Chip and Miles are startled awake later by Alaska frantically telling them she needs to leave because she had forgotten something. They provide a distraction for the Eagle so she can get in her car and drive away unnoticed.
The Eagle calls an assembly to announce to the student body that Alaska has died. Miles asks what happened and is informed that she drove straight into a police cruiser with its lights and sirens on, likely due to driving while intoxicated. Both Chip and Miles feel responsible for her death because they helped her drive away when they knew she was drunk. They mourn in different ways and attend Alaska’s funeral.
Miles and Chip go through Alaska’s room to see if there is anything they want to keep. They find a note she wrote in one of her books that said “straight and fast” was the way out of the labyrinth of suffering. This revelation makes Chip and Miles think she may have killed herself. Chip is eager to investigate her death and Miles reluctantly agrees to help. 
Religion class becomes more important to Miles after Alaska’s death because its subject matter becomes more real. Chip and Miles vent their anger to each other that so many people who did not know Alaska like they did are mourning her death. Chip leads their investigation into Alaska’s death. 
Chip and Miles interview the police officer who saw Alaska crash. Their interview supports their belief that she killed herself, so they research suicide warning signs. They do not remember Alaska exhibiting many of the warning signs and continue their investigation. Meanwhile, Miles avoids Lara. Takumi questions Miles about whether he is still dating Lara, and Takumi demands that Chip and Miles tell him about what they have been doing. They agree to tell him about their investigation in the future. 
Chip plans to see if Alaska might have been unable to swerve because of how drunk she was. He and Miles steal a breathalyzer from the Eagle and Chip drinks enough alcohol to match Alaska’s blood alcohol level at her time of death. He believes she would have been able to swerve, so he plans to call Jake, Alaska’s boyfriend, as a final effort. Miles is against calling Jake, but Chip does it anyway. They learn that Alaska told Jake that she would call him later, which further confuses the question of whether she killed herself or not.
Chip and Miles do not know what to investigate next, so they turn their attention to planning a prank in memory of Alaska. Chip pulls out plans Alaska had made for a prank, and Chip and Miles recruit other juniors at the school to execute it. They hire a male stripper, posing as a psychologist, to give a presentation at a Speaker’s Day event at their school. He delivers a speech about subverting the patriarchal paradigm and performs in front of the whole student body. 
Later in the year, Takumi points out to Chip and Miles that the date of Alaska’s death coincides with the date of the story Alaska shared with them about her mother’s death when they played a drinking game in the barn. The boys realize she must have forgotten the anniversary of her mother’s death and was driving to her grave to deliver flowers.

Contemplation,"Walden opens with a simple announcement that Thoreau spent two years in Walden Pond, near Concord, Massachusetts, living a simple life supported by no one. He says that he now resides among the civilized again; the episode was clearly both experimental and temporary. The first chapter, “Economy,” is a manifesto of social thought and meditations on domestic management, and in it Thoreau sketches out his ideals as he describes his pond project. He devotes attention to the skepticism and wonderment with which townspeople had greeted news of his project, and he defends himself from their views that society is the only place to live. He recounts the circumstances of his move to Walden Pond, along with a detailed account of the steps he took to construct his rustic habitation and the methods by which he supported himself in the course of his wilderness experiment. It is a chapter full of facts, figures, and practical advice, but also offers big ideas about the claims of individualism versus social existence, all interspersed with evidence of scholarship and a propensity for humor.
Thoreau tells us that he completed his cabin in the spring of 1845 and moved in on July 4 of that year. Most of the materials and tools he used to build his home he borrowed or scrounged from previous sites. The land he squats on belongs to his friend Ralph Waldo Emerson; he details a cost-analysis of the entire construction project. In order to make a little money, Thoreau cultivates a modest bean-field, a job that tends to occupy his mornings. He reserves his afternoons and evenings for contemplation, reading, and walking about the countryside. Endorsing the values of austerity, simplicity, and solitude, Thoreau consistently emphasizes the minimalism of his lifestyle and the contentment to be derived from it. He repeatedly contrasts his own freedom with the imprisonment of others who devote their lives to material prosperity.
Despite his isolation, Thoreau feels the presence of society surrounding him. The Fitchburg Railroad rushes past Walden Pond, interrupting his reveries and forcing him to contemplate the power of technology. Thoreau also finds occasion to converse with a wide range of other people, such as the occasional peasant farmer, railroad worker, or the odd visitor to Walden. He describes in some detail his association with a Canadian-born woodcutter, Alex Therien, who is grand and sincere in his character, though modest in intellectual attainments. Thoreau makes frequent trips into Concord to seek the society of his longtime friends and to conduct what scattered business the season demands. On one such trip, Thoreau spends a night in jail for refusing to pay a poll tax because, he says, the government supports slavery. Released the next day, Thoreau returns to Walden.
Thoreau devotes great attention to nature, the passing of the seasons, and the creatures with which he shares the woods. He recounts the habits of a panoply of animals, from woodchucks to partridges. Some he endows with a larger meaning, often spiritual or psychological. The hooting loon that plays hide and seek with Thoreau, for instance, becomes a symbol of the playfulness of nature and its divine laughter at human endeavors. Another example of animal symbolism is the full-fledged ant war that Thoreau stumbles upon, prompting him to meditate on human warfare. Thoreau’s interest in animals is not exactly like the naturalist’s or zoologist’s. He does not observe and describe them neutrally and scientifically, but gives them a moral and philosophical significance, as if each has a distinctive lesson to teach him.
As autumn turns to winter, Thoreau begins preparations for the arrival of the cold. He listens to the squirrel, the rabbit, and the fox as they scuttle about gathering food. He watches the migrating birds, and welcomes the pests that infest his cabin as they escape the coming frosts. He prepares his walls with plaster to shut out the wind. By day he makes a study of the snow and ice, giving special attention to the mystic blue ice of Walden Pond, and by night he sits and listens to the wind as it whips and whistles outside his door. Thoreau occasionally sees ice-fishermen come to cut out huge blocks that are shipped off to cities, and contemplates how most of the ice will melt and flow back to Walden Pond. Occasionally Thoreau receives a visit from a friend like William Ellery Channing or Amos Bronson Alcott, but for the most part he is alone. In one chapter, he conjures up visions of earlier residents of Walden Pond long dead and largely forgotten, including poor tradesmen and former slaves. Thoreau prefers to see himself in their company, rather than amid the cultivated and wealthy classes.
As he becomes acquainted with Walden Pond and neighboring ponds, Thoreau wants to map their layout and measure their depths. Thoreau finds that Walden Pond is no more than a hundred feet deep, thereby refuting common folk wisdom that it is bottomless. He meditates on the pond as a symbol of infinity that people need in their lives. Eventually winter gives way to spring, and with a huge crash and roar the ice of Walden Pond begins to melt and hit the shore. In lyric imagery echoing the onset of Judgment Day, Thoreau describes the coming of spring as a vast transformation of the face of the world, a time when all sins are forgiven.
Thoreau announces that his project at the pond is over, and that he returned to civilized life on September 6, 1847. The revitalization of the landscape suggests the restoration of the full powers of the human soul, and Thoreau’s narrative observations give way, in the last chapter of Walden, to a more direct sermonizing about the untapped potential within humanity. In visionary language, Thoreau exhorts us to “meet” our lives and live fully."
Beneficent,"Beloved begins in 1873 in Cincinnati, Ohio, where Sethe, a former slave, has been living with her eighteen-year-old daughter Denver. Sethe’s mother-in-law, Baby Suggs, lived with them until her death eight years earlier. Just before Baby Suggs’s death, Sethe’s two sons, Howard and Buglar, ran away. Sethe believes they fled because of the malevolent presence of an abusive ghost that has haunted their house at 124 Bluestone Road for years. Denver, however, likes the ghost, which everyone believes to be the spirit of her dead sister.
On the day the novel begins, Paul D, whom Sethe has not seen since they worked together on Mr. Garner’s Sweet Home plantation in Kentucky approximately twenty years earlier, stops by Sethe’s house. His presence resurrects memories that have lain buried in Sethe’s mind for almost two decades. From this point on, the story will unfold on two temporal planes. The present in Cincinnati constitutes one plane, while a series of events that took place around twenty years earlier, mostly in Kentucky, constitutes the other. This latter plane is accessed and described through the fragmented flashbacks of the major characters. Accordingly, we frequently read these flashbacks several times, sometimes from varying perspectives, with each successive narration of an event adding a little more information to the previous ones.
From these fragmented memories, the following story begins to emerge: Sethe, the protagonist, was born in the South to an African mother she never knew. When she is thirteen, she is sold to the Garners, who own Sweet Home and practice a comparatively benevolent kind of slavery. There, the other slaves, who are all men, lust after her but never touch her. Their names are Sixo, Paul D, Paul A, Paul F, and Halle. Sethe chooses to marry Halle, apparently in part because he has proven generous enough to buy his mother’s freedom by hiring himself out on the weekends. Together, Sethe and Halle have two sons, Howard and Buglar, as well as a baby daughter whose name we never learn. When she leaves Sweet Home, Sethe is also pregnant with a fourth child. After the eventual death of the proprietor, Mr. Garner, the widowed Mrs. Garner asks her sadistic, vehemently racist brother-in-law to help her run the farm. He is known to the slaves as schoolteacher, and his oppressive presence makes life on the plantation even more unbearable than it had been before. The slaves decide to run.
Schoolteacher and his nephews anticipate the slaves’ escape, however, and capture Paul D and Sixo. Schoolteacher kills Sixo and brings Paul D back to Sweet Home, where Paul D sees Sethe for what he believes will be the last time. She is still intent on running, having already sent her children ahead to her mother-in-law Baby Suggs’s house in Cincinnati. Invigorated by the recent capture, schoolteacher’s nephews seize Sethe in the barn and violate her, stealing the milk her body is storing for her infant daughter. Unbeknownst to Sethe, Halle is watching the event from a loft above her, where he lies frozen with horror. Afterward, Halle goes mad: Paul D sees him sitting by a churn with butter slathered all over his face. Paul D, meanwhile, is forced to suffer the indignity of wearing an iron bit in his mouth.
When schoolteacher finds out that Sethe has reported his and his nephews’ misdeeds to Mrs. Garner, he has her whipped severely, despite the fact that she is pregnant. Swollen and scarred, Sethe nevertheless runs away, but along the way she collapses from exhaustion in a forest. A white girl, Amy Denver, finds her and nurses her back to health. When Amy later helps Sethe deliver her baby in a boat, Sethe names this second daughter Denver after the girl who helped her. Sethe receives further help from Stamp Paid, who rows her across the Ohio River to Baby Suggs’s house. Baby Suggs cleans Sethe up before allowing her to see her three older children.
Sethe spends twenty-eight wonderful days in Cincinnati, where Baby Suggs serves as an unofficial preacher to the black community. On the last day, however, schoolteacher comes for Sethe to take her and her children back to Sweet Home. Rather than surrender her children to a life of dehumanizing slavery, she flees with them to the woodshed and tries to kill them. Only the third child, her older daughter, dies, her throat having been cut with a handsaw by Sethe. Sethe later arranges for the baby’s headstone to be carved with the word “Beloved.” The sheriff takes Sethe and Denver to jail, but a group of white abolitionists, led by the Bodwins, fights for her release. Sethe returns to the house at 124, where Baby Suggs has sunk into a deep depression. The community shuns the house, and the family continues to live in isolation.
Meanwhile, Paul D has endured torturous experiences in a chain gang in Georgia, where he was sent after trying to kill Brandywine, a slave owner to whom he was sold by schoolteacher. His traumatic experiences have caused him to lock away his memories, emotions, and ability to love in the “tin tobacco box” of his heart. One day, a fortuitous rainstorm allows Paul D and the other chain gang members to escape. He travels northward by following the blossoming spring flowers. Years later, he ends up on Sethe’s porch in Cincinnati.
Paul D’s arrival at 124 commences the series of events taking place in the present time frame. Prior to moving in, Paul D chases the house’s resident ghost away, which makes the already lonely Denver resent him from the start. Sethe and Paul D look forward to a promising future together, until one day, on their way home from a carnival, they encounter a strange young woman sleeping near the steps of 124. Most of the characters believe that the woman—who calls herself Beloved—is the embodied spirit of Sethe’s dead daughter, and the novel provides a wealth of evidence supporting this interpretation. Denver develops an obsessive attachment to Beloved, and Beloved’s attachment to Sethe is equally if not more intense. Paul D and Beloved hate each other, and Beloved controls Paul D by moving him around the house like a rag doll and by seducing him against his will.
When Paul D learns the story of Sethe’s “rough choice”—her infanticide—he leaves 124 and begins sleeping in the basement of the local church. In his absence, Sethe and Beloved’s relationship becomes more intense and exclusive. Beloved grows increasingly abusive, manipulative, and parasitic, and Sethe is obsessed with satisfying Beloved’s demands and making her understand why she murdered her. Worried by the way her mother is wasting away, Denver leaves the premises of 124 for the first time in twelve years in order to seek help from Lady Jones, her former teacher. The community provides the family with food and eventually organizes under the leadership of Ella, a woman who had worked on the Underground Railroad and helped with Sethe’s escape, in order to exorcise Beloved from 124. When they arrive at Sethe’s house, they see Sethe on the porch with Beloved, who stands smiling at them, naked and pregnant. Mr. Bodwin, who has come to 124 to take Denver to her new job, arrives at the house. Mistaking him for schoolteacher, Sethe runs at Mr. Bodwin with an ice pick. She is restrained, but in the confusion Beloved disappears, never to return.
Afterward, Paul D comes back to Sethe, who has retreated to Baby Suggs’s bed to die. Mourning Beloved, Sethe laments, “She was my best thing.” But Paul D replies, “You your best thing, Sethe.” The novel then ends with a warning that “[t]his is not a story to pass on.” The town, and even the residents of 124, have forgotten Beloved “[l]ike an unpleasant dream during a troubling sleep.”"
Squandered,"When Mr. Henry Dashwood dies, leaving all his money to his first wife's son John Dashwood, his second wife and her three daughters are left with no permanent home and very little income. Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters (Elinor, Marianne, and Margaret) are invited to stay with their distant relations, the Middletons, at Barton Park. Elinor is sad to leave their home at Norland because she has become closely attached to Edward Ferrars, the brother-in-law of her half-brother John. However, once at Barton Park, Elinor and Marianne discover many new acquaintances, including the retired officer and bachelor Colonel Brandon, and the gallant and impetuous John Willoughby, who rescues Marianne after she twists her ankle running down the hills of Barton in the rain. Willoughby openly and unabashedly courts Marianne, and together the two flaunt their attachment to one another, until Willoughby suddenly announces that he must depart for London on business, leaving Marianne lovesick and miserable. Meanwhile, Anne and Lucy Steele, two recently discovered relations of Lady Middleton's mother, Mrs. Jennings, arrive at Barton Park as guests of the Middletons. Lucy ingratiates herself to Elinor and informs her that she (Lucy) has been secretly engaged to Mr. Ferrars for a whole year. Elinor initially assumes that Lucy is referring to Edward's younger brother, Robert, but is shocked and pained to learn that Lucy is actually referring to her own beloved Edward.
In Volume II of the novel, Elinor and Marianne travel to London with Mrs. Jennings. Colonel Brandon informs Elinor that everyone in London is talking of an engagement between Willoughby and Marianne, though Marianne has not told her family of any such attachment. Marianne is anxious to be reunited with her beloved Willoughby, but when she sees him at a party in town, he cruelly rebuffs her and then sends her a letter denying that he ever had feelings for her. Colonel Brandon tells Elinor of Willoughby's history of callousness and debauchery, and Mrs. Jennings confirms that Willoughby, having squandered his fortune, has become engaged to the wealthy heiress Miss Grey.
In Volume III, Lucy's older sister inadvertently reveals the news of Lucy's secret engagement to Edward Ferrars. Edward's mother is outraged at the information and disinherits him, promising his fortune to Robert instead. Meanwhile, the Dashwood sisters visit family friends at Cleveland on their way home from London. At Cleveland, Marianne develops a severe cold while taking long walks in the rain, and she falls deathly ill. Upon hearing of her illness, Willoughby comes to visit, attempting to explain his misconduct and seek forgiveness. Elinor pities him and ultimately shares his story with Marianne, who finally realizes that she behaved imprudently with Willoughby and could never have been happy with him anyway. Mrs. Dashwood and Colonel Brandon arrive at Cleveland and are relieved to learn that Marianne has begun to recover.
When the Dashwoods return to Barton, they learn from their manservant that Lucy Steele and Mr. Ferrars are engaged. They assume that he means Edward Ferrars, and are thus unsurprised, but Edward himself soon arrives and corrects their misconception: it was Robert, not himself, whom the money-grubbing Lucy ultimately decided to marry. Thus,x Edward is finally free to propose to his beloved Elinor, and not long after, Marianne and Colonel Brandon become engaged as well. The couples live together at Delaford and remain in close touch with their mother and younger sister at Barton Cottage."
Govern,"In Common Sense, Thomas Paine argues for American independence. His argument begins with more general, theoretical reflections about government and religion, then progresses onto the specifics of the colonial situation.
Paine begins by distinguishing between government and society. Society, according to Paine, is everything constructive and good that people join together to accomplish. Government, on the other hand, is an institution whose sole purpose is to protect us from our own vices. Government has its origins in the evil of man and is therefore a necessary evil at best. Paine says that government's sole purpose is to protect life, liberty and property, and that a government should be judged solely on the basis of the extent to which it accomplishes this goal.
Paine then considers an imagined scenario in which a small group of people has been placed on an island, and cut off from the rest of society. In time, these people develop ties with one another, and lawmaking becomes inevitable. Paine says the people will be much happier if they are responsible for the creation of the laws that rule them. Paine is also implicitly arguing that such a system of representation is also better for the American colonists. Having expressed his disagreement with British reign in America, Paine proceeds to launch a general attack on the British system of government. Paine says the British system is too complex and rife with contradictions, and that the monarchy is granted far too much power. The British system pretends to offer a reasonable system of checks and balances, but in fact, it does not.
From here Paine moves on to discuss, in general, the notions of monarchy and hereditary succession. Man, Pain argues, was born into a state of equality, and the distinction that has arisen between king and subject is an unnatural one. At first, Paine says, the world was without kings, but the ancient Jews decided they wanted a king. This angered God, but he allowed them to have one. Paine presents pages of biblical evidence detailing God's wrath at the idea of the Jews having a king. The conclusion Paine reaches is that the practice of monarchy originates from sin, and is an institution that the Bible and God condemn. Paine calls hereditary succession an abominable practice. He says that even if people were to choose to have a king, that does not legitimize that King's child acting as a future ruler. Furthermore, hereditary succession has brought with it innumerable evils, such as incompetent kings, corruption, and civil war.
Having dispensed with the preliminary theoretical issues, Paine sets in to discuss the details of the American situation. In response to the argument that America has flourished under British rule, and therefore ought to stay under the king, Paine says that such an argument fails to realize that America has evolved and no longer needs Britain's help. Some say that Britain has protected America, and therefore deserves allegiance, but Paine responds that Britain has only watched over America in order to secure its own economic well-being. Paine adds that most recently, instead of watching over the colonies, the British have been attacking them, and are therefore undeserving of American loyalty.
Paine says that the colonies have little to gain from remaining attached to Britain. Commerce can be better conducted with the rest of Europe, but only after America becomes independent. Paine also asserts that if the colonies remain attached to Britain, the same problems that have arisen in the past will arise in the future. Paine argues that it is necessary to seek independence now, as to do otherwise would only briefly cover up problems that will surely reemerge.
Paine even proposes the form of government that the independent colonies should adopt. His recommendation is for a representative democracy that gives roughly equal weight to each of the colonies.
Paine explains why the current time is a good time to break free of Britain. Primarily, Paine focuses on the present size of the colonies, and on their current capabilities. He presents an inventory of the British Navy and gives calculations revealing how America could build a navy of comparable size. Paine recommends this as a way of ensuring America's security and prosperity in trade. Paine also argues that America is sufficiently small as to be united now. If time were to elapse, and the population of the colonies to grow, the same feeling of unity would not be present. Paine adds that if the Americans revolt now, they can use the vast expanses of uncharted land to the West in order to pay down some of the debt they will incur.
Paine says that as a colony of Britain, America lacks respectability on the international scene. They are seen simply as rebels, and cannot form substantial alliances with other nations. In order to prosper in the long term, the colonies need to be independent. Paine says that, by declaring independence, America will be able to ask for the help of other countries in its struggle for freedom. For all of these reasons, Paine says it is imperative and urgent that the colonies declare independence."
Revered,"In the Puritan New England town of Salem, Massachusetts, a group of girls goes dancing in the forest with a black slave named Tituba. While dancing, they are caught by the local minister, Reverend Parris. One of the girls, Parris’s daughter Betty, falls into a coma-like state. A crowd gathers in the Parris home while rumors of witchcraft fill the town. Having sent for Reverend Hale, an expert on witchcraft, Parris questions Abigail Williams, the girls’ ringleader, about the events that took place in the forest. Abigail, who is Parris’s niece and ward, admits to doing nothing beyond “dancing.”
While Parris tries to calm the crowd that has gathered in his home, Abigail talks to some of the other girls, telling them not to admit to anything. John Proctor, a local farmer, then enters and talks to Abigail alone. Unbeknownst to anyone else in the town, while working in Proctor’s home the previous year she engaged in an affair with him, which led to her being fired by his wife, Elizabeth. Abigail still desires Proctor, but he fends her off and tells her to end her foolishness with the girls.
Betty wakes up and begins screaming. Much of the crowd rushes upstairs and gathers in her bedroom, arguing over whether she is bewitched. A separate argument between Proctor, Parris, the argumentative Giles Corey, and the wealthy Thomas Putnam soon ensues. This dispute centers on money and land deeds, and it suggests that deep fault lines run through the Salem community. As the men argue, Reverend Hale arrives and examines Betty, while Proctor departs. Hale quizzes Abigail about the girls’ activities in the forest, grows suspicious of her behavior, and demands to speak to Tituba. After Parris and Hale interrogate her for a brief time, Tituba confesses to communing with the devil, and she hysterically accuses various townsfolk of consorting with the devil. Suddenly, Abigail joins her, confessing to having seen the devil conspiring and cavorting with other townspeople. Betty joins them in naming witches, and the crowd is thrown into an uproar.
A week later, alone in their farmhouse outside of town, John and Elizabeth Proctor discuss the ongoing trials and the escalating number of townsfolk who have been accused of being witches. Elizabeth urges her husband to denounce Abigail as a fraud; he refuses, and she becomes jealous, accusing him of still harboring feelings for her. Mary Warren, their servant and one of Abigail’s circle, returns from Salem with news that Elizabeth has been accused of witchcraft but the court did not pursue the accusation. Mary is sent up to bed, and John and Elizabeth continue their argument, only to be interrupted by a visit from Reverend Hale. While they discuss matters, Giles Corey and Francis Nurse come to the Proctor home with news that their wives have been arrested. Officers of the court suddenly arrive and arrest Elizabeth. After they have taken her, Proctor browbeats Mary, insisting that she must go to Salem and expose Abigail and the other girls as frauds.
The next day, Proctor brings Mary to court and tells Judge Danforth that she will testify that the girls are lying. Danforth is suspicious of Proctor’s motives and tells Proctor, truthfully, that Elizabeth is pregnant and will be spared for a time. Proctor persists in his charge, convincing Danforth to allow Mary to testify. Mary tells the court that the girls are lying. When the girls are brought in, they turn the tables by accusing Mary of bewitching them. Furious, Proctor confesses his affair with Abigail and accuses her of being motivated by jealousy of his wife. To test Proctor’s claim, Danforth summons Elizabeth and asks her if Proctor has been unfaithful to her. Despite her natural honesty, she lies to protect Proctor’s honor, and Danforth denounces Proctor as a liar. Meanwhile, Abigail and the girls again pretend that Mary is bewitching them, and Mary breaks down and accuses Proctor of being a witch. Proctor rages against her and against the court. He is arrested, and Hale quits the proceedings.
The summer passes and autumn arrives. The witch trials have caused unrest in neighboring towns, and Danforth grows nervous. Abigail has run away, taking all of Parris’s money with her. Hale, who has lost faith in the court, begs the accused witches to confess falsely in order to save their lives, but they refuse. Danforth, however, has an idea: he asks Elizabeth to talk John into confessing, and she agrees. Conflicted, but desiring to live, John agrees to confess, and the officers of the court rejoice. But he refuses to incriminate anyone else, and when the court insists that the confession must be made public, Proctor grows angry, tears it up, and retracts his admission of guilt. Despite Hale’s desperate pleas, Proctor goes to the gallows with the others, and the witch trials reach their awful conclusion."

Historic,"The Old Testament is a collection of thirty-nine books about the history and religion of the people of Israel. The authors of these books are unknown, and each book possesses a unique tone, style, and message. Individually, they include stories, laws, and sayings that are intended to function as models of religious and ethical conduct. Together—through hundreds of characters and detailed events—they represent a unified narrative about God and his attempt to relate to humankind by relating to a specific group of people.
The Old Testament contains four main sections: the Pentateuch, the Former Prophets (or Historical Books), the Writings, and the Latter Prophets. This study guide covers books from the first three sections.
The Pentateuch
The Pentateuch comprises the first five books of the Old Testament. It depicts a series of beginnings—the beginning of the world, of humankind, and of God’s promise to the Israelites.
Genesis, the first book, opens with God’s creation of the world. The perfect world falls into evil when humans disobey God, and the human population divides into separate nations and languages. After many generations, God speaks to a man named Abraham. God makes a promise, or covenant, with Abraham to make his descendants into a great nation and to give them a great land. Abraham shows strong faith in God, and God seals his promise with a number of signs and tests. This special covenant with God passes on to Abraham’s son, Isaac, and to his grandson, Jacob. Together, they represent the patriarchs, or fathers, of the Israelite people. Jacob’s twelve sons move to Egypt after the youngest brother, Joseph, miraculously becomes a high official in Egypt.
In the Book of Exodus, the descendants of Jacob’s children have become a vast people, but the Pharaoh of Egypt holds them in slavery. God chooses one man, Moses, to rescue the Israelites. God sends ten plagues to Egypt, and, with miraculous signs and wonders, Moses leads the people out of Egypt and across the Red Sea. They go to Mount Sinai, where God appears in a cloud of thunder over the mountain and affirms to the Israelites the promise he made to Abraham. God commands them to worship only himself, and he gives them various ethical and religious laws.
The books of Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy continue the explanation of God’s religious laws and his promises to the people. The people must keep these laws to enter and enjoy the promised land, toward which they are heading. Despite God’s presence, the Israelites complain and disobey incessantly, inciting God’s wrath. They wander the wilderness for forty years in search of the promised land. These books continue the period of Moses’s legendary leadership and miracles, until his death at the end of Deuteronomy.
The Former Prophets
The Former Prophets, or the Historical Books, cover the history of the Israelites from Moses’s death to the fall of the nation in 587 b.c. In the books of Joshua and Judges, the Israelites successfully conquer the land promised to them by God, but they disobey God by worshipping the deities of the surrounding peoples. Neighboring nations invade and oppress the Israelites. God saves the people of Israel by designating judges, or rulers, to lead the people in warding off their enemies.
The two books of Samuel (First Samuel and Second Samuel) cover the rise of the united kingdom of Israel. Israel’s religious leader, Samuel, appoints a king named Saul. Saul disobeys God, however, and God chooses another man, David, to be Israel’s king. King Saul attempts to kill the young David, but fails. Saul’s death closes the first book. In the second book, David establishes the great kingdom of Israel. He conquers Israel’s surrounding enemies and establishes Jerusalem as the religious and political center of Israel.
The books of Kings (called 1 Kings and 2 Kings) trace the decline of Israel’s success. God blesses David’s son, Solomon, with immense wisdom. As king, Solomon expands Israel into an empire and builds a great temple in Jerusalem. Solomon disobeys God by worshipping other deities, and, at his death, the kingdom splits into a northern kingdom, Israel, and a southern kingdom, Judah. A host of evil kings leads the two kingdoms away from worshipping God. Despite the attempts of the prophets Elijah and Elisha to halt Israel’s wrongdoing, the two kingdoms fall to the Assyrian and Babylonian Empires. Jerusalem is destroyed, and the people are sent into exile.
The Writings
The Writings are placed after the historical books in the Christian Bible. Some of these are narratives covering the time of Israel’s exile in other nations and its eventual return to the homeland. The Book of Esther, for example, tells the story of an unassuming Jewish girl who becomes the queen of Persia and boldly saves the Jewish people from genocide.
Many of the Writings are books of poetry and wisdom, among the most important literature in the Old Testament. The Book of Job is a lengthy dialogue investigating God’s justice and the problem of human suffering. The Psalms are lyrical poems and hymns—many attributed to King David—that express humankind’s longing for God. The books of Proverbs and Ecclesiastes—similarly attributed to the wise King Solomon—offer sayings and instructions about the meaning of life and ethical behavior. Lastly, the Song of Solomon (also attributed to Solomon) is a romantic, lyric dialogue between a young woman and her lover."
Personal,"Anne’s diary begins on her thirteenth birthday, June 12, 1942, and ends shortly after her fifteenth. At the start of her diary, Anne describes fairly typical girlhood experiences, writing about her friendships with other girls, her crushes on boys, and her academic performance at school. Because anti-Semitic laws forced Jews into separate schools, Anne and her older sister, Margot, attended the Jewish Lyceum in Amsterdam.
	The Franks had moved to the Netherlands in the years leading up to World War II to escape persecution in Germany. After the Germans invaded the Netherlands in 1940, the Franks were forced into hiding. With another family, the van Daans, and an acquaintance, Mr. Dussel, they moved into a small secret annex above Otto Frank’s office where they had stockpiled food and supplies. The employees from Otto’s firm helped hide the Franks and kept them supplied with food, medicine, and information about the outside world.
	The residents of the annex pay close attention to every development of the war by listening to the radio. Some bits of news catch Anne’s attention and make their way into her diary, providing a vivid historical context for her personal thoughts. The adults make optimistic bets about when the war will end, and their mood is severely affected by Allied setbacks or German advances. Amsterdam is devastated by the war during the two years the Franks are in hiding. All of the city’s residents suffer, since food becomes scarce and robberies more frequent.
	Anne often writes about her feelings of isolation and loneliness. She has a tumultuous relationship with the adults in the annex, particularly her mother, whom she considers lacking in love and affection. She adores her father, but she is frequently scolded and criticized by Mr. and Mrs. van Daan and Mr. Dussel. Anne thinks that her sister, Margot, is smart, pretty, and agreeable, but she does not feel close to her and does not write much about her. Anne eventually develops a close friendship with Peter van Daan, the teenage boy in the annex. Mr. Frank does not approve, however, and the intensity of Anne’s infatuation begins to lessen.
	Anne matures considerably throughout the course of her diary entries, moving from detailed accounts of basic activities to deeper, more profound thoughts about humanity and her own personal nature. She finds it difficult to understand why the Jews are being singled out and persecuted. Anne also confronts her own identity. Though she considers herself to be German, her German citizenship has been revoked, and though she calls Holland her home, many of the Dutch have turned against the Jews. Anne feels a tremendous solidarity with her aggrieved people, and yet at the same time she wants to be seen as an individual rather than a member of a persecuted group.
During the two years recorded in her diary, Anne deals with confinement and deprivation, as well as the complicated and difficult issues of growing up in the brutal circumstances of the Holocaust. Her diary describes a struggle to define herself within this climate of oppression. Anne’s diary ends without comment on August 1, 1944, the end of a seemingly normal day that leaves us with the expectation of seeing another entry on the next page. However, the Frank family is betrayed to the Nazis and arrested on August 4, 1944. Anne’s diary, the observations of an imaginative, friendly, sometimes petty, and rather normal teenage girl, comes to an abrupt and silent end. 
Otto Frank is the family’s sole survivor, and he recovers Anne’s diary from Miep. He decides to fulfill Anne’s wishes by publishing the diary. Anne’s diary becomes a condemnation of the unimaginable horror of the Holocaust, and one of the few accounts that describe it from a young person’s perspective.
	Since Anne’s diary is a true personal account of a life in hiding, it is inappropriate to analyze it as a novel or other work of fiction. Parts of the diary were intended for public view, but others clearly were not. To appreciate and interpret the diary, it is necessary to consider its horrible context, World War II and the Holocaust, before any discussion of plot development or thematic content."
Dies,"Around midnight one September night in New York City, eighteen-year-old Mateo Torrez gets a phone call from the mysterious organization Death-Cast. Death-Cast’s employees notify people known as Deckers that they will die within twenty-four hours, but no one knows exactly when or how their deaths will occur. Mateo is alone when he gets the news. Mateo is often home alone because he struggles with anxiety. His mother died in childbirth, and his father has been in a coma for two weeks. Not long after, seventeen-year-old Rufus Emeterio also gets a phone call from Death-Cast notifying him of his impending death. Rufus is in the middle of beating up his ex-girlfriend’s new boyfriend, Peck, while his foster brothers, Malcom and Tagoe, look on. Rufus, Malcolm, and Tagoe are best friends who call themselves the Plutos. Rufus’s parents and older sister died four months earlier when their car crashed into the Hudson River. 
After struggling to leave his apartment for a couple of hours, Mateo signs up on the Last Friend app. Last Friend connects Deckers with someone to spend their last day alive, called an End Day. Meanwhile, Rufus coordinates his own funeral with The Plutos, his foster parents, and his ex-girlfriend, Aimee. Aimee used to be a part of the Plutos until she was adopted by her aunt. Aimee brings Peck to the funeral. While Aimee and Rufus argue, Peck gets a friend to call the police on Rufus for beating him up. When the police show up, the Plutos help Rufus escape, but Tagoe and Malcolm are arrested. Now alone on his End Day, Rufus signs up on the Last Friend app where he connects with Mateo. After chatting for a little while, Rufus goes to Mateo’s apartment. They decide to spend their End Day together. First, they visit the hospital so Mateo can say goodbye to his father. Then, they spend time at Rufus’s favorite diner before Mateo visits his best friend, a single mother named Lidia. Mateo spends some time alone with Lidia and her daughter, Penny, but does not tell her it’s his End Day. After, Rufus shows Mateo his Instagram account. All his photos since his parents and sister died are in black and white. Mateo convinces Rufus to document his End Day using color photos instead. 
Rufus takes a phone call from Aimee and finds out that Malcolm and Tagoe were arrested for helping him beat up Peck. Mateo overhears part of the conversation and takes off, scared that Rufus is dangerous. Rufus catches up to Mateo and explains why the police are after him. He opens up about his complicated relationship with Aimee and the tragic day he witnessed the deaths of his parents and sister. Mateo realizes Rufus is not dangerous and promises not to leave again. The boys decide to visit Make-a-Moment, a virtual reality company meant to provide Deckers with bucket list experiences before they die. Rufus and Mateo choose to try skydiving but find it disappointing. While wandering the city after, they discover some old payphones in a ditch and Rufus takes pictures to post to his Instagram account. After, they take the subway to the cemetery where Mateo’s mother is buried. The boys stumble upon cemetery workers already digging Mateo’s grave. Despite the upsetting scene, Mateo finds a sense of closure and resolves to live his life to the fullest on his End Day. Mateo convinces Rufus to visit a pier over the Hudson River to mourn his family so that Rufus may find the same sense of peace with his own grief. Afterward, they narrowly survive a bombing at a bookstore, and the experience makes Rufus realize how scared he is of dying.  
Mateo realizes it’s important to spend your End Day with loved ones. He calls Lidia, and he and Rufus meet her at the World Travel Arena, an interactive experience where Deckers can visit places they’ll never get to see in real life. Rufus holds Mateo’s hand, and Mateo realizes that he has feelings for Rufus. After, Rufus, Mateo, and Lidia decide to go to a Decker club. At the club, Mateo lets loose and sings in public for the first time, then kisses Rufus. The Plutos show up, and they’re all having a great time until Peck and his gang arrive. Peck has been stalking Rufus’s Instagram account to discover his location. He wants to kill Rufus as payback for the beating Rufus gave him. Peck threatens Rufus with a gun, but Mateo punches Peck, saving Rufus. All the boys begin to fight, and Rufus wrestles the gun away, shooting all the bullets into a wall. Everyone scatters, Peck and his gang are arrested, and Mateo and Rufus decide to go to Mateo’s apartment. 
At Mateo’s home, Rufus and Mateo talk about all the things they would have liked to have done together if they had more time. Mateo sings for Rufus and tells him he loves him. Rufus says he loves Mateo too, and they decide not to leave Mateo’s room and curl up together in the bed to nap. When Mateo wakes up, he decides to make them both tea, but when he turns on the stove, it explodes and kills him. Rufus wakes up to the smoke and searches for Mateo. Rufus drags Mateo’s body out of the apartment, but it is too late. Rufus is taken to the hospital, but he leaves after visiting Mateo’s father and leaving him a note. On his way to the park where he and Mateo spent time earlier, Rufus plays a video of Mateo singing. Distracted, he steps into the street. He doesn’t see the car speeding toward him."
Locks,"Each chapter of Chains opens with a date ranging from May 27, 1776, to January 19, 1777, and a quotation from a document of the time. Since the novel uses the voice of the protagonist, Isabel, it reads much like a diary. The story opens with the funeral of Mary Finch, slave owner of Isabel and her sister Ruth and former owner of their deceased mother. Mary’s nephew, Robert, sells Isabel and Ruth to a couple from New York City, the Locktons, devout Tories who scorn the American Revolution and the rebels fighting against the king. Throughout the novel, people loyal to Britain call those fighting for independence “rebels,” while the men and women fighting to be free from Britain’s rule call themselves “patriots.” 
Isabel and Ruth travel from Rhode Island to New York by boat. At the dock, Madam Lockton hits Isabel, the first of many blows. Ruth, age five, is simple-minded, so Madam keeps her near and dressed like a pretty toy, while she works Isabel hard. Isabel promised their Momma that she would always protect Ruth. Isabel meets and becomes friends with Curzon, slave to patriot Mr. Bellingham. Curzon proposes that Isabel work for the patriots by spying on the Locktons in exchange for her freedom since Isabel might overhear secret plans. Madam’s cruelty convinces Isabel to join the patriot cause.
Becky Berry, a white servant, and Lady Seymour, Mr. Lockton’s aunt, both show kindness toward Isabel and Ruth. Isabel learns that money hidden in the Locktons’ wooden crate will pay patriots to switch sides, information valuable to the patriot leaders. This scheme and the plot to assassinate George Washington lead to Lockton’s arrest, but Isabel’s role is not suspected. Each day, Isabel fetches water from the Tea Water Pump, a gathering place for slaves, and meets a kind Grandfather who gives her good advice. Grandfather often speaks of “crossing the River Jordan” as a metaphor symbolizing each slave’s path to personal freedom.
When Madam witnesses Ruth’s seizure, she immediately wants to sell her, and Isabel realizes that the list of conspirators in the library drawer could be their ticket to escape. Isabel goes straight to Colonel Regan in the patriot headquarters, who gives her the code for future visits. As the Tories’ plans are uncovered, Lockton flees the city, leaving his wife behind. Isabel and Ruth attend the public hanging of the man blamed for the assassination plot, and the British plant their navy in the harbor, preparing for war. The patriots officially declare their independence, and the city fills with soldiers.
Madam sells Ruth, or so she says, which so infuriates Isabel that she angrily confronts Madam, an act that incites injury and Isabel’s escape. Isabel runs to Colonel Regan, who cannot help her, and she is dragged to a dungeon. After three hellish days, a judge sentences Isabel to be branded with an “I” on her cheek for Insolence. The branding is so painful Isabel loses consciousness for days and wakes in Lady Seymour’s house, nursed back to health, fed, and cleaned, her cheek still burning. Isabel must return to Madam and spends the next weeks in deep sadness, ignoring Curzon and wishing ill on Colonel Regan.
Violent thunderstorms hit New York City. Curzon has joined the patriot soldiers, who lose the Battle of Brooklyn and retreat. When the British invade New York, Isabel decides to work for them instead, hoping she’ll earn her freedom this way. She reports the location of Washington’s headquarters to a British officer, hoping he will help her escape, but he cannot. Lockton returns, and the Tories celebrate victory. When the Locktons and Lady Seymour accept British and Hussein soldiers into their homes, Isabel goes to Lady Seymour’s to help her care for them.
When the Great Fire hits New York, Isabel helps Lady Seymour escape, but Lady Seymour suffers great injury and her home is destroyed, so she moves in with the Locktons, along with more British soldiers and their wives, who take over the household chores. The British capture Fort Washington and march the surviving rebels to the prison, including Curzon. As Madam holds a feast to celebrate, Isabel overhears more plans, including hopes that thousands of prisoners would starve or die of disease. As Isabel carries a bowl of food scraps to the yard, she devises a plan.
Isabel begins to visit the prison regularly, delivering food and checking on Curzon, who has been shot. She earns the trust of a guard and a patriot leader. She nurses Lady Seymour, who supports her helping the prisoners. A shop owner gives Isabel a copy of Common Sense. Isabel carries messages between the prison and patriot officers at a huge risk to herself.
On Christmas, Isabel takes a long walk near the waterfront. Madam discovers that she’s been visiting the prison and forbids her from continuing to do so, so Isabel decides she must act. That evening, Isabel bakes a bread pudding and gifts it to a family in the burned part of the city, keeping Christmas the way her Momma did. A few days later, when Captain Morse asks Isabel to deliver a message to the prisoners informing them that Washington defeated the British in Trenton, she hears the prisoners cheer with joy. Afraid for his safety, Lockton flees to England. Lady Seymour apologizes to Isabel for not protecting her more and buying her herself, but Isabel cannot forgive her. When the prison guard offers Isabel work cleaning out the cells, she wonders if it’s an opportunity to pay for her freedom.
The city plans a celebration of the queen’s birthday, including dancing, fireworks, and feasting. Lady Seymour has suffered a stroke, which has left her unable to move or speak. On the day of the ball, Captain Morse asks Isabel to deliver a coin to another officer. That officer gives Isabel a note for Captain Morse, which she puts in her pocket. At home, Madam is furious because someone told her that her slave, Isabel, is passing notes for the rebels. When Madam demands the note, Isabel tosses it into the fire, inciting Madam’s wrath. In her fury, Madam lets it slip that she still owns Ruth, who has been living in Charleston, and then she locks Isabel in the cellar. Soon, Isabel escapes, determined to find Ruth. She writes herself a pass in the library, naming herself Isabel Gardener. Lady Seymour lets her take coins to aid her flight and whispers, “Run!”
Isabel runs to the prison, claiming to be there to clean, and finds Curzon in very bad shape. She hides him in a wheelbarrow and wheels him outside. She practically carries him to the waterfront, where they must pass a group of British soldiers. As they do, fireworks from the queen’s ball light the sky and distract the soldiers. Isabel steals a boat and rows herself and Curzon to New Jersey with bleeding and frozen hands. She wakes on the other side, knowing that they are free."
Suffers,"Note:  Billy Pilgrim, the novel’s protagonist, has become “unstuck in time.” He travels between periods of his life, unable to control which period he lands in. As a result, the narrative is not chronological or linear. Instead, it jumps back and forth in time and place. The novel is structured in small sections, each several paragraphs long, that describe various moments of his life.

Billy Pilgrim is born in 1922 and grows up in Ilium, New York. A funny-looking, weak youth, he does reasonably well in high school, enrolls in night classes at the Ilium School of Optometry, and is drafted into the army during World War II. He trains as a chaplain’s assistant in South Carolina, where an umpire officiates during practice battles and announces who survives and who dies before they all sit down to lunch together. Billy’s father dies in a hunting accident shortly before Billy ships overseas to join an infantry regiment in Luxembourg. Billy is thrown into the Battle of the Bulge in Belgium and is immediately taken prisoner behind German lines. Just before his capture, he experiences his first incident of time—shifting: he sees the entirety of his life, from beginning to end, in one sweep.
Billy is transported in a crowded railway boxcar to a POW camp in Germany. Upon his arrival, he and the other privates are treated to a feast by a group of fellow prisoners, who are English officers who were captured earlier in the war. Billy suffers a breakdown and gets a shot of morphine that sends him time-tripping again. Soon he and the other Americans travel onward to the beautiful city of Dresden, still relatively untouched by wartime privation. Here the prisoners must work for their keep at various labors, including the manufacture of a nutritional malt syrup. Their camp occupies a former slaughterhouse. One night, Allied forces carpet bomb the city, then drop incendiary bombs to create a firestorm that sucks most of the oxygen into the blaze, asphyxiating or incinerating roughly 130,000 people. Billy and his fellow POWs survive in an airtight meat locker. They emerge to find a moonscape of destruction, where they are forced to excavate corpses from the rubble. Several days later, Russian forces capture the city, and Billy’s involvement in the war ends.
Billy returns to Ilium and finishes optometry school. He gets engaged to Valencia Merble, the obese daughter of the school’s founder. After a nervous breakdown, Billy commits himself to a veterans’ hospital and receives shock treatments. During his stay in the mental ward, a fellow patient introduces Billy to the science fiction novels of a writer named Kilgore Trout. After his recuperation, Billy gets married. His wealthy father-in-law sets him up in the optometry business, and Billy and Valencia raise two children and grow rich. Billy acquires the trappings of the suburban American dream: a Cadillac, a stately home with modern appliances, a bejeweled wife, and the presidency of the Lions Club. He is not aware of keeping any secrets from himself, but at his eighteenth wedding anniversary party the sight of a barbershop quartet makes him break down because, he realizes, it triggers a memory of Dresden.
The night after his daughter’s wedding in 1967, as he later reveals on a radio talk show, Billy is kidnapped by two-foot-high aliens who resemble upside-down toilet plungers, who he says are called Tralfamadorians. They take him in their flying saucer to the planet Tralfamadore, where they mate him with a movie actress named Montana Wildhack. She, like Billy, has been brought from Earth to live under a transparent geodesic dome in a zoo where Tralfamadorians can observe extraterrestrial curiosities. The Tralfamadorians explain to Billy their perception of time, how its entire sweep exists for them simultaneously in the fourth dimension. When someone dies, that person is simply dead at a particular time. Somewhere else and at a different time he or she is alive and well. Tralfamadorians prefer to look at life’s nicer moments.
When he returns to Earth, Billy initially says nothing of his experiences. In 1968, he gets on a chartered plane to go to an optometry conference in Montreal. The plane crashes into a mountain, and, among the optometrists, only Billy survives. A brain surgeon operates on him in a Vermont hospital. On her way to visit him there, Valencia dies of accidental carbon monoxide poisoning after crashing her car. Billy’s daughter places him under the care of a nurse back home in Ilium. But he feels that the time is ripe to tell the world what he has learned. Billy has foreseen this moment while time-tripping, and he knows that his message will eventually be accepted. He sneaks off to New York City, where he goes on a radio talk show. Shortly thereafter, he writes a letter to the local paper. His daughter is at her wit’s end and does not know what to do with him. Billy makes a tape recording of his account of his death, which he predicts will occur in 1976 after Chicago has been hydrogen-bombed by the Chinese. He knows exactly how it will happen: a vengeful man he knew in the war will hire someone to shoot him. Billy adds that he will experience the violet hum of death and then will skip back to some other point in his life. He has seen it all many times."
League,"Part I of the novel, consisting of twenty-three chapters, begins in the summer of 1866 when something enormous and mysterious is sighted at various locations on the ocean. This “sea monster” is treated as a tall tale at first, but when shipwrecks start to occur, Admiral Farragut of the U.S. Navy is sent on a mission to find the monster. He enlists the help of ocean expert Professor Pierre Aronnax of the Museum of Natural History in Paris, along with Aronnax’s servant, Conseil. Farragut also enlists a master harpooner from Canada named Ned Land who has unparalleled eyesight and a quick hand. The Abraham Lincoln sets off from New York City, and after searching the Atlantic, the frigate rounds Cape Horn and heads for the Pacific. There they find the monster, a man-made submarine that sprays enormous waterspouts at the frigate, damaging its rudder and knocking Aronnax, Conseil, and Land into the ocean.
The three men are taken captive aboard the Nautilus, the invention of Captain Nemo, who commands a devoted crew of men who live completely apart from society, even speaking their own invented language. The prisoners are well fed and soon realize the sophistication of their surroundings. Nemo tells them they are free on the ship, but they are not free to leave. If they don’t agree to the situation, Nemo will drown them. The vessel has an abundant library of books, art, and specimens, enticing to Aronnax. The crew prepares elaborate meals from sea products, and the whole enterprise is powered by electricity produced from sea minerals. The vessel must surface to take on air, but other than that, it is entirely self-sufficient.
Aronnax is astounded by the sea life that he can observe from inside the Nautilus and even more impressed with the intimacy of their walks on the sea floor wearing suits and helmets with individual lanterns. Nemo invites the captives on a deep-sea hunting expedition in a submarine forest. They use electric guns to kill prey. The captives spend a few days on land when the Nautilus runs aground near Australia and they must wait for high tide to set the Nautilus free. On the island, Aronnax, Conseil, and Land hunt real meat and encounter natives who chase them away. When the island natives try to get into the submarine, they are shocked by electric cables. As the Nautilus speeds to the Indian Ocean, Nemo orders Aronnax, Conseil, and Land to their quarters, where they sleep deeply after eating drugged food. The next morning, Nemo calls Aronnax to care for a wounded crew member, but the man dies. At the end of Part I, the captives attend the man’s burial in a breathtakingly beautiful underwater cemetery.
Part II also takes place in twenty-three chapters, starting up two years later than Part I, in January 1868. This part of the novel begins with Nemo inviting the captives on a pearl expedition near Ceylon, where he shows them an enormous pearl that he chooses not to harvest. During this expedition, Nemo is threatened by a shark, but Land saves him by harpooning it. They enter the Red Sea and discover that Nemo has found a subterranean passage, the Arabian Tunnel, that takes them to the Mediterranean Sea. One night, a diver appears outside the window of the Nautilus, and Aronnax witnesses Nemo handing over a chest of gold ingots to the diver. The vessel later passes through boiling waters caused by an underground volcano. Nemo maintains a high speed and feels cramped between the two continents. They pass through the Straits of Gibraltar and head to Virgo Bay, where Nemo retrieves treasure from a 1702 shipwreck. They go on another underwater excursion to see the lost city of Atlantis and spend time inside an extinct volcano while the crew extracts coal that will help power the Nautilus. They encounter some whales that Nemo forbids Land to hunt, but they purposely hit other whales, called “cachalots,” that threaten the other whales.
The Nautilus continues southward toward Antarctica, and Aronnax is astounded by the beauty of the icy world. When they are trapped by an iceberg, Nemo decides that they will dive under it even though they risk running out of air. His plan works. They determine that they are at the South Pole and prove that the pole is a land mass. Nemo plants a flag, claiming the Pole for his own as he is the first man to step on the land. Later, when the Nautilus is again trapped by a toppled iceberg, the situation turns dire. The men are running out of air. The men all work together and take turns digging at the ice walls with axes. On board the Nautilus, they grow dizzy and faint with lack of oxygen. At the last minute, the Nautilus breaks through the ice, and fresh air rushes in. During this ordeal, Conseil and Land save Aronnax’s life by sharing their last portion of air with him. The vessel moves northward to Cape Horn and speeds to the Caribbean, arriving by April 20. There, they encounter a group of giant squid who attack the vessel and kill one of the crew members before they can drive the creatures back into the sea.
After these challenges, Nemo grows sullen, silent, and absent. The Nautilus moves northward up the coast, but the weather is too rough for Aronnax, Conseil, and Land to attempt an escape. Nemo shows Aronnax a manuscript of his life history that he will shut into a waterproof case to be tossed into the sea by the last survivor of the Nautilus. A hurricane pushes the vessel farther out to sea, where they spot the failed transatlantic telegraph cable. Nemo tells the story of a sunken ship named the Avenger that sank with its crew exactly seventy-four years before. They spot an approaching warship. Nemo orders the captives below after the warship shoots at them. Nemo shouts his intention to take revenge. The Nautilus rams the ship, causing it to sink with all its crew. The scene ends with Nemo in front of the portrait of his wife and children, sobbing. Two weeks pass during which Aronnax does not see Nemo at all. The captives plan to escape one night near Norway’s coast. Just as they are about to escape, they see a maelstrom, a whirling storm that overtakes the vessel. Aronnax’s head strikes the hull, and he loses consciousness. When he wakes, he is with Conseil and Land on an island. They do not know what has happened to Nemo and the Nautilus."
Suns,"A Thousand Splendid Suns is divided into four parts. Part 1 tells the story of Mariam, a young girl born in Afghanistan in the 1950s. Part 2 describes the early life of Laila, who was born in Kabul in the late 1970’s. The lives of the two women intersect in Part 3. Part 4 is from Laila’s perspective. Throughout the story, global and regional power struggles bring chaos and destruction to both women’s lives, and to the country of Afghanistan.
Mariam spends the first fifteen years of her life living with her mother, Nana, in a small kolba (shack) built for them by Mariam’s father, Jalil. Nana and Jalil were not married when Nana became pregnant with Mariam, and Nana often reminds Mariam that she is a harami, an illegitimate child. Jalil visits Mariam weekly, and Mariam longs to be accepted by her father as his other children are. Mariam has one dear friend, Mullah Faizullah, the town tutor. He teaches Mariam from the Koran and cares for Mariam like family. On Mariam’s fifteenth birthday, Jalil does not fulfill his promise to take her to the cinema. It is Mariam’s one wish to be seen around town with her father. When Jalil does not arrive, Mariam leaves her home to find him. Mariam is turned away from her father’s home. When she is taken back to her kolba, Mariam discovers that Nana has hung herself. 
Mariam feels responsible for Nana’s death. When Mariam asked Jalil to take her to see “Pinocchio,” Nana begged Mariam not to leave her alone. Mullah Faizullah tries to comfort Mariam, by visiting her as much as he can. Jalil’s wives soon tell Mariam that she is to be married. Mariam begs her father not to send her away, but Jalil’s decision has already been made. Mariam is married to Rasheed, a shoemaker nearly thirty years older than Mariam. When Jalil sends Mariam to Kabul to live with her new husband, Mariam tells Jalil she never wishes to see him again.
Rasheed’s Islamic beliefs are fundamentalist, and he expects Mariam to keep house, respect her husband, and cover herself when she leaves their home. Kabul is a confusing place for Mariam. While Mariam wears a burqa in public, she sees other women wearing makeup and high heels. Within a few years, Mariam becomes pregnant, and Rasheed prays for a boy. Fariba, a woman from Rasheed’s neighborhood, discovers Mariam bleeding. Rasheed takes Mariam to the hospital, and a doctor confirms that Mariam has had a miscarriage. Soon, Rasheed’s critical attitude toward his wife turns abusive.
In 1978, the political environment in Afghanistan is chaotic. The communist party gains power and eventually overthrows the Afghan government and executes its president. Fariba’s daughter, Laila, is born during this revolution.
Laila has never known her brothers, Ahmad and Noor. The two young men are members of the Afghan resistance fighting against the communist rule of Soviet Russia. Laila’s Mammy is often unwell, in bed, and finds fault with her husband. Hakim, whom Laila calls Babi, is a teacher at the university in Kabul. Babi is tender with Laila and patient with Mammy. When Laila’s family is informed of her brother’s deaths, Mammy is despondent. Laila feels guilty for not grieving as deeply as Mammy. Laila cares more for her dearest friend, Tariq, than she does for her brothers.
Tariq, just a few years older than Laila, is kind to her and a fierce protector. Even though Tariq has lost a leg, he fights neighborhood boys when they bully Laila. As they grow older, Laila becomes more aware of the gossip that surrounds her friendship with Tariq. Though Laila worries about her reputation, she allows her relationship with Tariq to become intimate. By 1992, Laila is fourteen. Communist forces in Afghanistan have been overthrown, and the city of Kabul becomes a battleground for rival warlords. When Tariq tells Laila that his family is leaving Afghanistan, Laila is overcome. The young couple sleep together, even though they have been taught that this is a sin against Allah. Laila refuses to go with Tariq; she will not leave her parents behind. 
Babi finally convinces Mammy to leave Kabul, even though it is Mammy’s dearest wish to see her sons’ cause prevail. As Laila is packing, a rocket hits their home, leaving Mammy and Babi dead and Laila gravely injured.
Rasheed pulls Laila from the rubble, and Mariam nurses Laila back to health. Laila receives a visit from a man named Abdul Sharif. The stranger tells Laila that he spent time in a hospital with Tariq before Tariq died. Laila is heartbroken, and believes Allah is punishing her for not grieving her brothers properly. Rasheed proposes to Laila, and Laila accepts because she is pregnant with Tariq’s child. Laila knows that she has no other choice. Rasheed and Laila are married. Soon, Laila tells Rasheed that she is having his child, and Rasheed once more prays for a son. Again, he is disappointed. Mariam sees how cruel Rasheed is to Laila and her infant daughter, Aziza. Mariam’s once hostile attitude toward Laila grows into fondness. Aziza and Mariam develop a special relationship. 
Rasheed’s cruelty toward the women in his family is tolerated under the new Shari’a law, enforced by the new Taliban regime. Rasheed is now sure that Tariq is Aziza’s real father, and Rasheed uses this secret to keep Laila in line. Mariam and Laila attempt to take the children and leave Rasheed, but the women and children are caught. Under the Taliban, it is illegal for women to run away from the husbands. Rasheed beats Laila and Mariam for trying to leave, and he threatens them with worse if they try again.
Laila does eventually give Rasheed a son, Zalmai. Rasheed spoils his son, and he continues mistreating his wives and Aziza. Rasheed is foolish with his money. When he loses his job, Rasheed forces Laila to put Aziza in an orphanage. Though it is illegal for women to leave their homes without a male family member, Laila visits Aziza as often as she can. She must avoid the Taliban forces, who beat her when they catch her alone. One day, Laila receives a visitor of her own. Tariq is not dead. He has come to take Mariam with him back to Pakistan. Mariam realizes that Rasheed paid a friend to make up the story about Tariq’s death, in order to convince Laila to marry Rasheed.
Zalmai tells his father that Laila had a male visitor. Rasheed is furious, and Mariam sees that he will kill Laila. Mariam beats Rasheed with a shovel until he is dead. Mariam knows she will not live after committing this crime, and she sends Laila and the children away with Tariq. Mariam confesses to murdering her husband, and she is sentenced to death. 
Laila and Tariq take the children to Pakistan, and the two are married. Aziza bonds quickly with her real father, knowing that Tariq will never hurt or leave her. Zalmai asks for Rasheed at first, but he soon learns to love Tariq too. Laila and Tariq watch from afar as the Taliban are driven out by allied forces, following the attack on the United States on September 11th, 2001. Laila convinces Tariq to return to Kabul. On their way home, Laila visits Mariam’s hometown to say goodbye to the woman who saved her life. While there, she meets the son of Mullah Faizullah. Laila learns that the tutor is dead, and so is Mariam’s father Jalil. Jalil had written Mariam a letter, asking for her forgiveness, and he had intended to give Mariam the money from his sold land. 
Laila and Tariq use the money to renovate the orphanage, where Laila is now a teacher. Laila is pregnant with a third child. Kabul has been restored, and Laila wishes her parents were alive to see it."
Misconstrued,"The Unbearable Lightness of Being opens with a philosophical discussion of lightness versus heaviness. Kundera contrasts Nietzsche's philosophy of eternal return, or of heaviness, with Parmenides's understanding of life as light. Kundera wonders if any meaning or weight can be attributed to life, since there is no eternal return: if man only has the opportunity to try one path, to make one decision, he cannot return to take a different path, and then compare the two lives. Without the ability to co mpare lives, Kundera argues, we cannot find meaning; where meaning should exist we find only an unbearable weightlessness. The uncertain existence of meaning, and the opposition of lightness and heaviness, the key dichotomy of The Unbearable Lightness of Being, sets the stage for the entire novel.
The year is 1968. The protagonist, Tomas, a brilliant Prague surgeon, pursues a philosophy of lightness in his erotic adventures and exploits. Briefly married in the past, he neither sees nor wishes to see his ex-wife or young son and is comfortably established as a perpetual bachelor. He meets Tereza, a café waitress in a town he visits, and realizes when she follows him to Prague that she intends to ""offer him up her life."" A determined libertine, he momentarily resists his budding roma ntic feelings for her, then gives in to his love.
Tereza had been living a frustrated life as a waitress in a small town, and dreamed of escaping, especially from her vulgar mother. She recognizes in Tomas an intellectual and dreamer, and falls in love with him instantly. The two live together, but Tomas is unable to give up his mistresses. For a while he hides his infidelity from Teresa. Eventually he admits to it, but claims that his sexuality is entirely separate from his love for her. Tereza, unable to accept his behavior or adopt a light attitud e towards sex, suffers increasingly from nightmares, and contemplates suicide.
To keep Tereza happy, Tomas marries her. He keeps his mistresses, however, including his closest friend and long-term lover Sabina, a beautiful, reckless, and talented painter. In spite of herself, Tereza is charmed by Sabina's openness and light-heartedness, and the two women grow friendly. Sabina finds Tereza a job in Prague as a photographer. Despite her friendship with Sabina, however, Tereza's jealousy of Tomas does not slacken.
The events of the Prague Spring result in the Soviet military occupation of the city. Tomas, who in the past wrote an article condemning the Czech Communists, is warned to leave. Sabina flees first, and later Tomas and Tereza join her in Switzerland. Tereza, who found some fulfillment in her job as photographer in Prague, realizes that in Zurich she is jobless and must sit at home while Tomas continues having affairs. She decides that ""when the strong were too weak to hurt the weak, the weak had to be strong enough to leave,"" and returns to Prague. Tomas attempts to enjoy his newly recovered freedom for a few days, then gives up and returns to Prague and Tereza. The return truly means giving up freedom—there is no chance that the couple will be allo wed to leave again. In Prague, Tomas's political troubles escalate. He loses his position as surgeon for refusing to sign a denunciation of his anti-Communist article. Both the Communist regime and underground dissidents attempt to seduce him to their side. His own son reappears as a young dissident and preaches to Tomas with no success, for Tomas hates the idea of being used politically in the same way Sabina hates artistic kitsch. In the end, Tomas seeks obscurity in a job washing windows. His fame persists, however, and he continues seducing the women he works for.
Tereza, now a bartender, in a moment of desperation has an affair with a tall engineer who comes to her bar. She does so in hopes of coming closer to Tomas's way of life; instead she grows more miserable and becomes convinced the man was a police agent hired to gather potential blackmailing material. After many scenes and nightmares, she convinces Tomas to move with her to the country. This means giving up their way of life entirely, and an end to Tomas's erotic adventures.
After living peacefully in the country for some time, Tomas and Tereza are killed one night in a driving accident; they die instantly and together.
In Geneva, Sabina has a love affair with Franz, a university professor and idealistic intellectual who has more in common emotionally with Tereza than Sabina—he imbues his life with heavy meaning. He views Sabina as a romantic and courageous Czech dissident, and is tortured that he must betray his wife Marie-Claude in order to see her. Sabina loves Franz but their views on betrayal differ dramatically; whereas he hates the idea of betrayal, she views betrayal as the first step towards ""going off into the unknown,"" the most glorious thing she can think of.
When Franz leaves his wife and expects to move in with her, Sabina abruptly leaves Switzerland. Sabina leaves Geneva for Paris and then Paris for America; she learns of Tomas and Tereza's deaths from a letter and understands her last link to the past has been broken. She ends up living with an elderly American couple and wondering if she has reached the end of her perpetual flight.
Franz remains separated from his wife. After Sabina's betrayal, he finds consolation with a young student, a girl in over-sized glasses who loves him simply. Franz never accepts that he clearly misunderstood Sabina, but continues to hold her image as in ideal in his head, (wrongly) thinking his decisions in life would have made her proud. At his death, his wife reclaims Franz's body and orders the words ""A return after long wanderings"" written on his tombstone."
Encyclopedia,"In the prologue, we meet a man named Elwood Curtis who is living in New York City. As a teenager, he attended the Nickel Academy, a reform school in Florida that is now being demolished. He reads in the newspaper that a secret graveyard has been discovered on the grounds and realizes that he needs to return to the school and tell his story.
Part One of the book takes place in 1962 in Tallahassee, Florida, where a teenage Elwood Curtis receives a record album of speeches by Martin Luther King, Jr. The speeches introduce him to the Civil Rights Movement and have a profound impact on his thinking. Since his parents left town, Elwood has been raised by his strict grandmother, Harriet. After school, Elwood goes to the Richmond Hotel where Harriet works, and he waits in the kitchen, interacting with the staff. One day the kitchen staff trick Elwood into a dish-drying competition and his prize is a set of encyclopedias left behind by a traveling salesman. After hauling the heavy books home, he discovers that all but one of the volumes are blank. Elwood is hurt that the staff took advantage of his trusting nature, and he stops going to the hotel. 
Elwood gets a job as a stock boy at Marconi’s Tobacco & Cigars, a neighborhood grocery. He reads magazines there and becomes more immersed in the Civil Rights Movement. He is smart and capable, but his grandmother and Mr. Marconi worry that his high ideals will get him in trouble. When he exposes some boys who are shoplifting candy, Mr. Marconi disapproves and the boys beat up Elwood after work. A teacher, Mr. Hill, arrives at Elwood’s high school and encourages Elwood’s enthusiasm for civil rights. He gives Elwood books to read, meets him at a local demonstration, and ultimately arranges for Elwood to take a class at a nearby community college. Elwood hitchhikes to see the school, and it turns out that the man who is giving him a ride is driving a stolen car. They’re pulled over by the police and Elwood gets arrested. 
At the beginning of Part Two, a judge sentences Elwood to a reform school called Nickel Academy. He’s taken there in handcuffs with two white boys. Once they arrive, Elwood is hopeful because the Academy looks like a school, not a prison. He is assigned to Cleveland dormitory on the Black students’ campus. The next morning, Desmond, a boy from his dormitory, shows him around. Elwood learns that Nickel is not providing an education, and he is assigned to work on the yard crew with Jaimie, a Hispanic boy who is moved back and forth from the Black campus to the white campus. Desmond and others tell Elwood how to get along at Nickel so he can get released early. Elwood vows to keep quiet and get out early. However, when he sees a boy, Corey, being bullied in the bathroom, he steps in to intervene. All four boys, including Corey and Elwood, are taken from their beds in the middle of the night by the superintendent, Maynard Spencer, and a white houseman named Earl, and subjected to a brutal beating in a building called the White House.
Elwood wakes up from the beating in the school infirmary, where he stays for two weeks until his legs and back have healed. Turner, Elwood’s best friend, eats soap powder to make himself sick so he can visit Elwood. Turner counsels Elwood to try to avoid conflict. Elwood, however, believes that if people are confronted by injustice, they will do the right thing. However, when he sees the scars on his legs from the beating, Elwood is ashamed that he let himself be beaten so badly and doesn’t tell his grandmother about the incident when she visits. 
When Elwood returns to Nickel campus life, Turner gets him a new job called “Community Service.”  Elwood and Turner leave campus in a van with a white 20-year-old named Harper. They bring goods that meant to be used for the Black boys at Nickel and distribute them to local businessmen. The businessmen give envelopes of money to Harper for the medicine, food, and other supplies. Harper then gives the money to Superintendent Spencer and his boss, Director Hardee. After this, Harper leaves Turner and Elwood at the home of one of the board members to paint his gazebo. At night, Elwood writes down everything they do in a notebook.
Every year at Nickel there is a student boxing match between the best Black boxer and the best white boxer. This year the Black boxer is a large, violent bully nicknamed Griff. Superintendent Spencer tells Griff that he needs to lose the fight on purpose, pretending to be knocked out in the third, final round. But the night of the fight, Griff wins. He tells Spencer that he lost track of the rounds and thought there was one more. That night, Spencer and Earl take Griff “out back,” chain him between two trees, and beat him to death. The boys on campus convince themselves that Griff escaped, but his body is found in the secret cemetery decades later.
The students work on an elaborate Christmas Festival containing lights and large displays that attract paying tourists. The festival includes a staff luncheon, and Jaimie puts poison in housemaster Earl’s drink, hoping to kill him. But Earl lives and no one realizes he was poisoned. 
Part Three of the book alternates between adult Elwood’s life in the 1970s and teenage Elwood’s life in Nickel. In the 1970s, Elwood has a girlfriend and is working for a moving company in New York City. He buys his own van and starts a company, Ace Moving, which he later realizes he named after the highest level of achievement at Nickel. 
Back in the 1960s, Elwood realizes that Nickel is breaking him down. The merit and punishment system at Nickel is arbitrary and he feels unable to earn early release. He is losing hope and losing his belief in the teachings of Martin Luther King, Jr. When his grandmother tells him that the lawyer she hired to help him left town with their money, Elwood decides he wants to expose Nickel’s injustices and get the school closed down. 
In the 1980s, Elwood, now the owner of a successful moving company, is recognized on the street by Chickie Pete, who was a fellow student at Nickel. They go to a bar for a drink, and Elwood reflects on how damaged all the boys from Nickel are. Chickie Pete has just gotten out of rehab and has no job or place to live. Elwood is a successful businessman, but he struggles with relationships and is still unmarried. Chickie Pete asks Elwood for a job, but Elwood throws Chickie Pete’s contact information out the window on his cab ride home.
In the 1960s, Spencer is told about an upcoming “surprise” inspection by the state, and all the boys get busy fixing up Nickel and hiding its secrets. Elwood decides to give his notebook, which details the corruption at Nickel, to one of the inspectors. Turner tells him that this is a bad idea and begs him not to do it. Elwood again states his philosophy that people are ultimately good and want to do what is right. On the day of the inspection, Elwood is sent on an errand and is unable to give his notebook to the inspectors, so Turner volunteers to do it for him. When they meet up again, Turner tells Elwood that he handed the notebook to an inspector who looked like John F. Kennedy through the car window as he was leaving. A few nights later, Spencer and his new assistant, Hennepin, come for Elwood at night and he is beaten at the White House. 
In the 2000s, Elwood meets his wife Millie at a fancy restaurant in Harlem. He reflects on a time when the neighborhood was more run-down. 
When the narrative returns to the past, Elwood is locked in a dark room on the top floor of the dormitory, a form of solitary confinement that has been outlawed by the state. He’s there for weeks, subsisting on hardly any food and subjected to extra beatings by Spencer and Hennepin. One night, Turner comes and gets Elwood, telling him that the boys overheard that the following night Spencer is going to take him “out back” and kill him like they killed Griff. Turner and Elwood run away, taking bikes from a house they had cleared out as part of Community Service. They ride all night and through the next day, trying to get to Tallahassee. Turner and Elwood are almost there when a white van pulls up beside them—the Community Service van from Nickel. The boys run across a field as Hennepin and Harper shoot at them with rifles. Hennepin misses, but Harper shoots Elwood, who falls to his death with arms outstretched. Turner keeps running, leaving Elwood behind. 
Back in New York in 2014, Turner, who took Elwood’s identity after he escaped, tells his wife Millie the true story. He tells her about his time in Nickel and reveals his full name: Jack Turner (though no one but his mother has ever called him Jack). They cry together, and Millie commits to helping Turner heal from the trauma of his horrific experience.
The next day, Turner flies to Tallahassee to attend a hearing where the Nickel boys will tell the stories of the atrocities they witnessed and endured. Turner is the only Black alumnus testifying. Turner plans to tell the story of Elwood’s death, and presumably Griff’s story and other accounts. Before the hearing, he has lunch in the restaurant at the hotel where he is staying. The hotel is now called the Radisson, but it used to be the Richmond Hotel. Although Turner doesn’t make the connection, this is the same hotel restaurant where young Elwood sat in the kitchen waiting for his grandmother and dreaming of the day that a Black man would be served in the dining room."
Polygamy,"Esi, a government official who works for the Department of Urban Statistics, drives her old car over to the offices of Linga HideAway Travel in order to make some business travel arrangements. There, she meets the head of the company, Ali Kondey, a charming and handsome man who is later described as the best advertisement for the company because of his multiple national identities. The two are immediately attracted to each another. Ali offers to drive Esi home after promising to take care of all of the necessary travel arrangements, but Esi declines because she has her own car.
One morning, Ogyaanowa, the daughter of Esi and Oko, listens to the sounds of her parents fighting while she eats her breakfast. In the bedroom, Oko and Esi instigate yet another fight about their marriage. Oko is angry that Esi refuses to have another child and that she spends so much time at work. Oko says that his friends are beginning to laugh at him. Angry, he grabs Esi and forces her to have sex with him. Rather than apologize for his actions, he grabs the bed sheet and walks out of the bedroom. At work, Esi contemplates the fact that what just happened to her could be described as marital rape, even though no such term exists. She decides that she is going to leave her husband.
Opokuya, Esi’s best friend, begins a conversation with her husband, Kubi, about which of them needs the car. Opokuya, in addition to being a nurse, is also a mother. Although Kubi’s needs are frequently less pressing than Opakuya’s, he almost always “wins” their argument and gets use of the car. Esi runs into Opokuya in a hotel lobby. The two women have a drink and discuss Esi’s recent decision to divorce her husband. As they talk, Ali coincidentally enters the hotel as well. Esi tells Opokuya about the gifts that Ali has been sending her, and Opokuya tells Esi about her children and marriage. Esi hopes that Opokuya can understand her decision to leave Oko.
Ali is already married to his childhood friend and love, Fusena. The two have known each other since they were young, and after developing a friendship, they finally married. Following their marriage, Ali moved to London to complete his education. Fusena gave up her career and education in order to become a mother at Ali’s insistence. In spite of his marriage to Fusena, Ali and Esi’s relationship grows, and they soon become lovers. Ali disappears for two weeks, in part because of complications with his marriage and work. Shortly after he sees Esi again, he proposes to her. After discussing the potential complications with family and Ali’s wife, Ali offers Esi a wedding band. Following the proposal, Ali begins to spend more and more time at Esi’s house, showering her and her family with gifts. Esi discusses with Opokuya her upcoming marriage and her thoughts on polygamy.
Ali takes one of his coworkers to visit Esi’s family to discuss the marriage according to proper tradition. He is rejected because he fails to bring along a respectable member of his family. When Ali finally approaches his family and asks them to speak on his behalf, they are at first reluctant, but eventually consent. Esi’s mother and grandmother are disappointed in her decision to get divorced and become a second wife, but in the end they accept her decision. Ali returns to Esi’s family with his elders, and the marriage is approved. It is a simple ceremony, and afterward, Esi returns home alone.
On New Year’s Eve, Ali rushes over to Esi’s house before returning to his family. Shortly after, Oko appears with their daughter, and the two men begin to fight. Esi grabs Ogyaanowa and runs out of the house to Opokuya’s place. She tells Opokuya and Kubi everything that happened. Kubi goes to Esi’s house and finds that both men have left. He checks on Oko at Oko’s mother’s house and finds that he is only slightly injured.
Six months later, Ali takes Esi to Bamako, his home village, for a vacation. They have a wonderful time. Ali’s family, after initially rejecting Esi, now accepts her. Their relationship begins to change, though after they return, Ali starts spending less time with Esi. Rather than spending time with her after work, he drives his new secretary, who is young and attractive, home. By the end of the year, Esi feels completely abandoned. She is alienated from her own daughter and spends Christmas alone. She takes sleeping pills to help her get through the day. Finally, on New Year’s Day, Ali appears at Esi’s house, driving a brand new car. The car is a present and a bribe for Esi. Immediately after giving her the car, Ali drives off. Esi drives the new car to Opokuya’s house. Opokuya is so jealous and taken aback by the new car that Esi cannot begin to tell her how she really feels about the present. Esi offers Opokuya her old car.
At the start of another new year, Ali spends more time with Esi but quickly falls back into his old habits. He sends her gifts from all over the world in order to compensate for his absence. Three years into their marriage, Esi finally tells Ali that she cannot be in such a relationship with him. Three months later, Opokuya finally goes to Esi’s house to take away her old car. She is too excited about owning a car to share in Esi’s sadness. After Opokuya leaves, Kubi arrives and searches for his wife. Upon seeing that Esi is distraught, he hugs her and then begins to kiss her. Before Kubi can take off his clothes, Esi backs away from him, and he leaves. Esi and Ali remain close friends and occasional lovers, and they never get a divorce even though Ali continues to have affairs with other women."
My,"Jim Burden, a successful New York City lawyer, gives an acquaintance a memoir of his Nebraska childhood in the form of a recollection of their mutual friend, Ántonia Shimerda. This memoir makes up the bulk of the novel.
Jim first arrives in Nebraska at the age of ten, when he makes the trip west to live with his grandparents after finding himself an orphan in Virginia. On the train out west, Jim gets his first glimpse of the Shimerdas, a Bohemian immigrant family traveling in the same direction.
As fate would have it, the Shimerdas have taken up residence in farm neighboring the Burdens’. Jim makes fast friends with the Shimerda children, especially Ántonia, who is nearest to him in age and eager to learn English. Jim tutors Ántonia, and the two of them spend much of the autumn exploring their new landscape together.
In late January, tragedy strikes with the suicide of Mr. Shimerda. After an emotional funeral, the Shimerdas retreat into despair, and the Burdens struggle to be as accommodating as possible. As a result of the hardships that the Shimerdas suffer, Ántonia and Jim find that a wedge has been driven between them.
A couple of years later, the Burdens decide to move into town, and shortly thereafter Ántonia takes a job as a housekeeper with a neighboring family, the Harlings. Jim begins to see more of Ántonia once again, especially when a dancing pavilion comes to town and enlivens the social scene.
Jim’s high school years quickly come to a close, and he is offered a spot at the university in Lincoln. He makes a great success of his high school commencement speech and spends the summer hard at work in preparation for his course of study. Before leaving, he takes one last trip out to the countryside with Ántonia and her friends, where they gather to reminisce about old times together.
In Lincoln, Jim throws himself into his studies, which take up the majority of his time in the first year and a half of his course. In the spring of his second year, he begins to see a good deal of Lena Lingard, a mutual friend of his and Ántonia’s who has always intrigued Jim. After a few months of theatergoing and dalliances about town, Jim decides that he needs to make a fresh start of things and prepares to transfer to Harvard University for his final two years of college.
While Jim is away, Ántonia gets engaged to a local boy and moves to Denver in order to be with him. Days before the wedding, the boy -abandons Ántonia, and she returns to Nebraska heartbroken. She covers up an unexpected pregnancy throughout its term, but in giving birth to a daughter incurs the disapproval of her family.

Upon hearing of Ántonia’s situation, he decides to drive out to the countryside and visit her. They spend a happy day together reliving old times, and Jim parts with a promise to visit her again very soon.
Twenty years pass before Jim is able to visit Ántonia again. In the intervening period, he establishes himself as a prosperous New York City lawyer, and Ántonia marries and has many children with a man named Cuzak, also of Bohemian origin. Jim’s visit to the Cuzak farm is a happy one, with plenty of laughter and stories. Ántonia and Jim renew their old ties, and Jim resolves to be in closer contact with the Cuzaks in the -coming years.
As he prepares to leave Nebraska and return to New York City, Jim walks along the outskirts of town, near the overgrown road that leads to his childhood home.

Thoughtful,"Charlie, the fifteen-year-old narrator of The Perks of Being a Wallflower, has just entered his freshman year of high school when the book begins. Charlie is the eponymous “wallflower.” He is quiet and withdrawn, but he is also extremely observant and thoughtful, always paying close attention to everything going on around him, even if he is only a silent witness. Charlie writes the entire book as a series of letters to an anonymous “friend.” The reader never learns who this “friend” is, and the “friend” never writes back. Each letter begins with the greeting “Dear friend” and ends “Love always, Charlie.” Because the recipient of the letters never writes back, the novel reads like a series of diary entries.
When the novel opens, Charlie is grappling with two major traumatic deaths of loved ones in his past. The most recent death occurred last spring, when his only friend from middle school committed suicide. When Charlie was seven, his beloved Aunt Helen was killed in a car crash on Christmas Eve, which is also Charlie’s birthday. Although Charlie is nervous about entering high school, he soon finds acceptance from two main sources. First, his English teacher, Bill Anderson, recognizes Charlie’s talent for literature, and he takes him under his wing, assigning him extra books to read and essays to write over the course of the year. Also, Charlie begins to participate more in events, and he becomes friends with Patrick and his stepsister, Sam, who integrate him into their friend group. Charlie develops an enormous crush on Sam, which he tells her about, but Sam treats him affectionately. Patrick, who is gay, is having a closeted relationship with Brad, the quarterback of the football team. Sam kisses Charlie so that his first kiss can be from someone who loves him.
As the school year progresses, Charlie begins to come out of his shell somewhat, but Charlie’s life, his family life, and his friends’ lives become more and more complicated. The holidays are always a difficult time for Charlie’s family, because they bring up memories of Aunt Helen’s death. This year is no exception. Even though Charlie finds some solace in reading and re-reading The Catcher in the Rye, he still struggles to cope with his depression and with flashbacks of his time with Aunt Helen. However, Charlie’s acceptance by his friend group helps him become more at peace with himself. As Charlie becomes more mature, his relationship with his sister also deepens. Charlie’s sister has an abusive boyfriend. Charlie tells Bill about the boyfriend, and Bill reports it to their parents, which makes his sister mad at Charlie. But when Charlie’s sister becomes pregnant, she decides to have an abortion, she trusts Charlie to drive her to the clinic.
After Charlie performs as Rocky in one of his friend group’s regular viewings of the film The Rocky Horror Picture Show, Mary Elizabeth, a smart, pretty senior in their friend group, starts dating Charlie. However, Mary Elizabeth is far more interested in Mary Elizabeth than in having a relationship. During a game of Truth or Dare, Charlie is dared to kiss the prettiest girl in the room, and he kisses Sam. Mary Elizabeth stalks out of the room in a rage. In solidarity, the rest of the group sides with Mary Elizabeth, and Patrick advises Charlie to stay away from everyone for a while until tempers cool down.
Brad’s abusive father discovers Patrick and Brad’s relationship, and Brad is sent to rehab. When Brad returns, he refuses to speak to Patrick. Patrick confronts Brad in the cafeteria, Brad makes a derogatory comment about Patrick’s homosexuality, and Brad’s football teammates beat up Patrick. Charlie jumps in and, in a whirlwind, breaks up the fight. His defense of Patrick wins back the respect of Sam and his friend group. Patrick is thoroughly depressed and he leans on Charlie for emotional support. Patrick gets drunk and kisses Charlie, but he apologizes, and Charlie understands that Patrick is lonely and doesn’t know how to handle it. Eventually, Patrick sees Brad kissing a strange man in the park, which helps Patrick pull himself together and move on.
At the end of the school year, Charlie becomes increasingly anxious as the prospect of all his senior friends moving away becomes more and more imminent. When Sam is packing to leave for her summer pre-college program, she and Charlie begin to make out and start to have sexual contact, but Charlie suddenly gets extremely uncomfortable. The sexual contact dredges up a repressed memory of his Aunt Helen molesting him as a child.
In an epilogue, Charlie writes a final letter to his “friend,” dated two months later, saying that his parents had found him naked in a catatonic state on the couch. They took him to a mental hospital, where Charlie eventually realizes that Aunt Helen had sexually abused him, but that he had repressed these memories. Charlie forgives the memory of his Aunt Helen, and the novel ends with Charlie writing that he is planning to stop writing letters and to start participating fully in his life."
Weigh,"Guy Montag is a fireman who burns books in a futuristic American city. In Montag’s world, firemen start fires rather than putting them out. The people in this society do not read books, enjoy nature, spend time by themselves, think independently, or have meaningful conversations. Instead, they drive very fast, watch excessive amounts of television on wall-size sets, and listen to the radio on “Seashell Radio” sets attached to their ears.
Montag encounters a gentle seventeen-year-old girl named Clarisse McClellan, who opens his eyes to the emptiness of his life with her innocently penetrating questions and her unusual love of people and nature. Over the next few days, Montag experiences a series of disturbing events. First, his wife, Mildred, attempts suicide by swallowing a bottle of sleeping pills. Then, when he responds to an alarm that an old woman has a stash of hidden literature, the woman shocks him by choosing to be burned alive along with her books. A few days later, he hears that Clarisse has been killed by a speeding car. Montag’s dissatisfaction with his life increases, and he begins to search for a solution in a stash of books that he has stolen from his own fires and hidden inside an air-conditioning vent.
When Montag fails to show up for work, his fire chief, Beatty, pays a visit to his house. Beatty explains that it’s normal for a fireman to go through a phase of wondering what books have to offer, and he delivers a dizzying monologue explaining how books came to be banned in the first place. According to Beatty, special-interest groups and other “minorities” objected to books that offended them. Soon, books all began to look the same, as writers tried to avoid offending anybody. This was not enough, however, and society as a whole decided to simply burn books rather than permit conflicting opinions. Beatty tells Montag to take twenty-four hours or so to see if his stolen books contain anything worthwhile and then turn them in for incineration. Montag begins a long and frenzied night of reading.
Overwhelmed by the task of reading, Montag looks to his wife for help and support, but she prefers television to her husband’s company and cannot understand why he would want to take the terrible risk of reading books. He remembers that he once met a retired English professor named Faber sitting in a park, and he decides that this man might be able to help him understand what he reads. He visits Faber, who tells him that the value of books lies in the detailed awareness of life that they contain. Faber says that Montag needs not only books but also the leisure to read them and the freedom to act upon their ideas.
Faber agrees to help Montag with his reading, and they concoct a risky scheme to overthrow the status quo. Faber will contact a printer and begin reproducing books, and Montag will plant books in the homes of firemen to discredit the profession and to destroy the machinery of censorship. Faber gives him a two-way radio earpiece (the “green bullet”) so that he can hear what Montag hears and talk to him secretly.
Montag goes home, and soon two of his wife’s friends arrive to watch television. The women discuss their families and the war that is about to be declared in an extremely frivolous manner. Their superficiality angers him, and he takes out a book of poetry and reads “Dover Beach” by Matthew Arnold. Faber buzzes in his ear for him to be quiet, and Mildred tries to explain that the poetry reading is a standard way for firemen to demonstrate the uselessness of literature. The women are extremely disturbed by the poem and leave to file a complaint against Montag.
Montag goes to the fire station and hands over one of his books to Beatty. Beatty confuses Montag by barraging him with contradictory quotations from great books. Beatty exploits these contradictions to show that literature is morbid and dangerously complex, and that it deserves incineration. Suddenly, the alarm sounds, and they rush off to answer the call, only to find that the alarm is at Montag’s own house. Mildred gets into a cab with her suitcase, and Montag realizes that his own wife has betrayed him.
Beatty forces Montag to burn the house himself; when he is done, Beatty places him under arrest. When Beatty continues to berate Montag, Montag turns the flamethrower on his superior and proceeds to burn him to ashes. Montag knocks the other firemen unconscious and runs. The Mechanical Hound, a monstrous machine that Beatty has set to attack Montag, pounces and injects Montag’s leg with a large dose of anesthetic. Montag manages to destroy it with his flamethrower; then he walks off the numbness in his leg and escapes with some books that were hidden in his backyard. He hides these in another fireman’s house and calls in an alarm from a pay phone.
Montag goes to Faber’s house, where he learns that a new Hound has been put on his trail, along with several helicopters and a television crew. Faber tells Montag that he is leaving for St. Louis to see a retired printer who may be able to help them. Montag gives Faber some money and tells him how to remove Montag’s scent from his house so the Hound will not enter it. Montag then takes some of Faber’s old clothes and runs off toward the river. The whole city watches as the chase unfolds on TV, but Montag manages to escape in the river and change into Faber’s clothes to disguise his scent. He drifts downstream into the country and follows a set of abandoned railroad tracks until he finds a group of renegade intellectuals (“the Book People”), led by a man named Granger, who welcome him. They are a part of a nationwide network of book lovers who have memorized many great works of literature and philosophy. They hope that they may be of some help to mankind in the aftermath of the war that has just been declared. Montag’s role is to memorize the Book of Ecclesiastes. Enemy jets appear in the sky and completely obliterate the city with bombs. Montag and his new friends move on to search for survivors and rebuild civilization."
Sanctimonious,"The full title of Swift's pamphlet is ""A Modest Proposal for Preventing the Children of Poor People from Being a Burthen to their Parents, or the Country, and for Making them Beneficial to the Publick."" The tract is an ironically conceived attempt to ""find out a fair, cheap, and easy Method"" for converting the starving children of Ireland into ""sound and useful members of the Commonwealth."" Across the country poor children, predominantly Catholics, are living in squalor because their families are too poor to keep them fed and clothed.
The author argues, by hard-edged economic reasoning as well as from a self-righteous moral stance, for a way to turn this problem into its own solution. His proposal, in effect, is to fatten up these undernourished children and feed them to Ireland's rich land-owners. Children of the poor could be sold into a meat market at the age of one, he argues, thus combating overpopulation and unemployment, sparing families the expense of child-bearing while providing them with a little extra income, improving the culinary experience of the wealthy, and contributing to the overall economic well-being of the nation.
The author offers statistical support for his assertions and gives specific data about the number of children to be sold, their weight and price, and the projected consumption patterns. He suggests some recipes for preparing this delicious new meat, and he feels sure that innovative cooks will be quick to generate more. He also anticipates that the practice of selling and eating children will have positive effects on family morality: husbands will treat their wives with more respect, and parents will value their children in ways hitherto unknown. His conclusion is that the implementation of this project will do more to solve Ireland's complex social, political, and economic problems than any other measure that has been proposed."
Repeating,"In “moon,” the first of the four parts of feed, an American teenager named Titus travels to the lunar surface with his high-school friends for spring break, hoping to escape the boredom they feel on Earth. No specific date is revealed, though it’s sometime in a dystopic future, where the moon is fully commercialized and people suffer from red sores called lesions. As Titus and his fellow upper-class friends Link, Marty, Calista, Loga, and Quendy arrive on the moon, readers also get their first glimpse of “the feed.” Although Titus doesn’t initially reveal exact details about the feed or how it works, he says it sends the friends ads and images for where to stay and shop. 
After failing to get into college-age parties, the group visits the Ricochet Lounge, where Titus becomes infatuated with a girl named Violet. She is beautiful and, he soon finds, visiting the moon by herself and is very unlike his friends: She doesn’t make pointless purchases at a mall they all soon visit and isn’t interested in malfunctioning, or falling into a drug-like stupor, via their connections to the feed. Later, when they all visit a dance club called the Rumble Spot, an old man from a dissenter group called the Coalition of Pity hacks into people’s individual feeds, causing them to broadcast the signal, “we enter a time of calamity” over the feed’s network. Police beat the man and “shut off” those hacked, including Titus and Violet, who hold hands as they collapse.
Part 2, “eden,” occurs in a lunar hospital where Violet, Titus, and his friends remain disconnected from the feed until their systems can be scanned for viruses. There, Titus provides additional details about what the feed is and how it works. Feeds are implanted inside the body and connect to a global network that provides news, entertainment, and a means to purchase every kind of product, he says while singing its praises. The feed even anticipates and creates users’ wants from individual profiles based on purchasing decisions, thoughts, and feelings. Titus and Violet grow closer during the stay. Violet, who’s home-schooled and smarter than Titus and his friends, says she hoped to enjoy herself like normal kids but now has a problem, though she remains vague about what this problem is. When doctors finally restore the friends’ feeds, they rejoice. Promotions begin to flow through their minds again, though there’s also ominous news concerning protests over America’s annexation of the moon and resulting anger from a group called the Global Alliance. Still, Titus says, the friends exalt in the return of their feeds.
In Part 3, “Utopia,” Titus and his friends return to Earth and life returns to normal for them: “upcars” travel in tubes past vertically stacked suburbs, the friends party, and U.S. President Trumbull scoffs at reports that claim toxic industries cause lesions. In defiance of rampant consumerism and a loss of individuality, Violet determines to resist the feed by creating a completely random customer profile and asks Titus to join her. Violet, who didn’t receive her feed until she was seven, voices deep concern about the decline of the world and destruction of Earth, and laments how those who’ve had the feed their entire lives are ignorant and self-centered. Titus soon has nightmares that are more likely hacks from the Coalition of Pity. In them, he sees disturbing images of eco destruction and human suffering around the world, but after Violet chats him, saying she has seen the images too, he only wants to go back to sleep.
Before long, Violet’s problem becomes clear: Her body begins to fail and she’s told by doctors that the damage to her feedware can be fatal. The prognosis makes Violet realize how much she wants to do. She starts by going to the seashore with Titus, though they need to dress in protective suits due to its toxicity. Meanwhile, feed chatter reveals that all of Earth’s forests have fallen and there is a growing rift between the U.S. and the Global Alliance. At a party where Quendy shows off her artificial lesions, Violet becomes outraged and her body falters. She chastises Titus and his friends for living in ignorance as the world dies, then collapses and is brought to the hospital. 
Violet’s condition declines further in Part 4, “slumberland,” whose chapter titles track her feed efficiency from a high of 87.3 percent to a low of 4.6 percent, 98 percent being optimal. Aware that she doesn’t have much time, Violet messages Titus a list of twenty-two things she wants to do in life, though he grows increasingly distant, and doesn’t message back. When they do reconnect, Violet sends Titus a recent memory where she falls down a staircase and receives a response from the corporation FeedTech, denying her petition to pay for her system repairs because she wasn’t deemed to be worthy due to her random customer profile. Violet later sends Titus childhood memories to preserve her history, though he deletes them. And when Violet convinces him to visit the mountains with her, one of her life goals, Titus breaks up with her, saying he was only interested in a short relationship while she wanted something eternal. 
Time passes and Titus eventually hears from Violet’s father. At Violet’s home, Titus sees her lying on a floating bed, completely pale, fully incapacitated, and covered in discs. Her father details her final, painful days and how her body failed. He then berates Titus for how badly he treated Violet and for willfully living in ignorance. Titus later visits Violet’s home a second time. Although she appears dead, her feed efficiency is at 4.6 percent and a screen shows that her heart is beating slightly. Nevertheless, Titus tells Violet a story he plans to keep telling her, he says, so she will remember herself. The story is about Violet, the end of America, and their relationship, where they learn something important about love and how to resist the feed. The book ends with a promotion on the feed for Blue-Jean Warehouse’s Final Sales Event and a recurring, fading message that “Everything must go.”"
Midst,"In the midst of a raging war, a plane evacuating a group of schoolboys from Britain is shot down over a deserted tropical island. Two of the boys, Ralph and Piggy, discover a conch shell on the beach, and Piggy realizes it could be used as a horn to summon the other boys. Once assembled, the boys set about electing a leader and devising a way to be rescued. They choose Ralph as their leader, and Ralph appoints another boy, Jack, to be in charge of the boys who will hunt food for the entire group.
Ralph, Jack, and another boy, Simon, set off on an expedition to explore the island. When they return, Ralph declares that they must light a signal fire to attract the attention of passing ships. The boys succeed in igniting some dead wood by focusing sunlight through the lenses of Piggy’s eyeglasses. However, the boys pay more attention to playing than to monitoring the fire, and the flames quickly engulf the forest. A large swath of dead wood burns out of control, and one of the youngest boys in the group disappears, presumably having burned to death.
At first, the boys enjoy their life without grown-ups and spend much of their time splashing in the water and playing games. Ralph, however, complains that they should be maintaining the signal fire and building huts for shelter. The hunters fail in their attempt to catch a wild pig, but their leader, Jack, becomes increasingly preoccupied with the act of hunting.
When a ship passes by on the horizon one day, Ralph and Piggy notice, to their horror, that the signal fire—which had been the hunters’ responsibility to maintain—has burned out. Furious, Ralph accosts Jack, but the hunter has just returned with his first kill, and all the hunters seem gripped with a strange frenzy, reenacting the chase in a kind of wild dance. Piggy criticizes Jack, who hits Piggy across the face. Ralph blows the conch shell and reprimands the boys in a speech intended to restore order. At the meeting, it quickly becomes clear that some of the boys have started to become afraid. The littlest boys, known as “littluns,” have been troubled by nightmares from the beginning, and more and more boys now believe that there is some sort of beast or monster lurking on the island. The older boys try to convince the others at the meeting to think rationally, asking where such a monster could possibly hide during the daytime. One of the littluns suggests that it hides in the sea—a proposition that terrifies the entire group.
Not long after the meeting, some military planes engage in a battle high above the island. The boys, asleep below, do not notice the flashing lights and explosions in the clouds. A parachutist drifts to earth on the signal-fire mountain, dead. Sam and Eric, the twins responsible for watching the fire at night, are asleep and do not see the parachutist land. When the twins wake up, they see the enormous silhouette of his parachute and hear the strange flapping noises it makes. Thinking the island beast is at hand, they rush back to the camp in terror and report that the beast has attacked them.
The boys organize a hunting expedition to search for the monster. Jack and Ralph, who are increasingly at odds, travel up the mountain. They see the silhouette of the parachute from a distance and think that it looks like a huge, deformed ape. The group holds a meeting at which Jack and Ralph tell the others of the sighting. Jack says that Ralph is a coward and that he should be removed from office, but the other boys refuse to vote Ralph out of power. Jack angrily runs away down the beach, calling all the hunters to join him. Ralph rallies the remaining boys to build a new signal fire, this time on the beach rather than on the mountain. They obey, but before they have finished the task, most of them have slipped away to join Jack.
Jack declares himself the leader of the new tribe of hunters and organizes a hunt and a violent, ritual slaughter of a sow to solemnize the occasion. The hunters then decapitate the sow and place its head on a sharpened stake in the jungle as an offering to the beast. Later, encountering the bloody, fly-covered head, Simon has a terrible vision, during which it seems to him that the head is speaking. The voice, which he imagines as belonging to the Lord of the Flies, says that Simon will never escape him, for he exists within all men. Simon faints. When he wakes up, he goes to the mountain, where he sees the dead parachutist. Understanding then that the beast does not exist externally but rather within each individual boy, Simon travels to the beach to tell the others what he has seen. But the others are in the midst of a chaotic revelry—even Ralph and Piggy have joined Jack’s feast—and when they see Simon’s shadowy figure emerge from the jungle, they fall upon him and kill him with their bare hands and teeth.
The following morning, Ralph and Piggy discuss what they have done. Jack’s hunters attack them and their few followers and steal Piggy’s glasses in the process. Ralph’s group travels to Jack’s stronghold in an attempt to make Jack see reason, but Jack orders Sam and Eric tied up and fights with Ralph. In the ensuing battle, one boy, Roger, rolls a boulder down the mountain, killing Piggy and shattering the conch shell. Ralph barely manages to escape a torrent of spears.
Ralph hides for the rest of the night and the following day, while the others hunt him like an animal. Jack has the other boys ignite the forest in order to smoke Ralph out of his hiding place. Ralph stays in the forest, where he discovers and destroys the sow’s head, but eventually, he is forced out onto the beach, where he knows the other boys will soon arrive to kill him. Ralph collapses in exhaustion, but when he looks up, he sees a British naval officer standing over him. The officer’s ship noticed the fire raging in the jungle. The other boys reach the beach and stop in their tracks at the sight of the officer. Amazed at the spectacle of this group of bloodthirsty, savage children, the officer asks Ralph to explain. Ralph is overwhelmed by the knowledge that he is safe but, thinking about what has happened on the island, he begins to weep. The other boys begin to sob as well. The officer turns his back so that the boys may regain their composure."
Colonists,"In Common Sense, Thomas Paine argues for American independence. His argument begins with more general, theoretical reflections about government and religion, then progresses onto the specifics of the colonial situation.
Paine begins by distinguishing between government and society. Society, according to Paine, is everything constructive and good that people join together to accomplish. Government, on the other hand, is an institution whose sole purpose is to protect us from our own vices. Government has its origins in the evil of man and is therefore a necessary evil at best. Paine says that government's sole purpose is to protect life, liberty and property, and that a government should be judged solely on the basis of the extent to which it accomplishes this goal.
Paine then considers an imagined scenario in which a small group of people has been placed on an island, and cut off from the rest of society. In time, these people develop ties with one another, and lawmaking becomes inevitable. Paine says the people will be much happier if they are responsible for the creation of the laws that rule them. Paine is also implicitly arguing that such a system of representation is also better for the American colonists. Having expressed his disagreement with British reign in America, Paine proceeds to launch a general attack on the British system of government. Paine says the British system is too complex and rife with contradictions, and that the monarchy is granted far too much power. The British system pretends to offer a reasonable system of checks and balances, but in fact, it does not.
From here Paine moves on to discuss, in general, the notions of monarchy and hereditary succession. Man, Pain argues, was born into a state of equality, and the distinction that has arisen between king and subject is an unnatural one. At first, Paine says, the world was without kings, but the ancient Jews decided they wanted a king. This angered God, but he allowed them to have one. Paine presents pages of biblical evidence detailing God's wrath at the idea of the Jews having a king. The conclusion Paine reaches is that the practice of monarchy originates from sin, and is an institution that the Bible and God condemn. Paine calls hereditary succession an abominable practice. He says that even if people were to choose to have a king, that does not legitimize that King's child acting as a future ruler. Furthermore, hereditary succession has brought with it innumerable evils, such as incompetent kings, corruption, and civil war.
Having dispensed with the preliminary theoretical issues, Paine sets in to discuss the details of the American situation. In response to the argument that America has flourished under British rule, and therefore ought to stay under the king, Paine says that such an argument fails to realize that America has evolved and no longer needs Britain's help. Some say that Britain has protected America, and therefore deserves allegiance, but Paine responds that Britain has only watched over America in order to secure its own economic well-being. Paine adds that most recently, instead of watching over the colonies, the British have been attacking them, and are therefore undeserving of American loyalty.
Paine says that the colonies have little to gain from remaining attached to Britain. Commerce can be better conducted with the rest of Europe, but only after America becomes independent. Paine also asserts that if the colonies remain attached to Britain, the same problems that have arisen in the past will arise in the future. Paine argues that it is necessary to seek independence now, as to do otherwise would only briefly cover up problems that will surely reemerge.
Paine even proposes the form of government that the independent colonies should adopt. His recommendation is for a representative democracy that gives roughly equal weight to each of the colonies.
Paine explains why the current time is a good time to break free of Britain. Primarily, Paine focuses on the present size of the colonies, and on their current capabilities. He presents an inventory of the British Navy and gives calculations revealing how America could build a navy of comparable size. Paine recommends this as a way of ensuring America's security and prosperity in trade. Paine also argues that America is sufficiently small as to be united now. If time were to elapse, and the population of the colonies to grow, the same feeling of unity would not be present. Paine adds that if the Americans revolt now, they can use the vast expanses of uncharted land to the West in order to pay down some of the debt they will incur.
Paine says that as a colony of Britain, America lacks respectability on the international scene. They are seen simply as rebels, and cannot form substantial alliances with other nations. In order to prosper in the long term, the colonies need to be independent. Paine says that, by declaring independence, America will be able to ask for the help of other countries in its struggle for freedom. For all of these reasons, Paine says it is imperative and urgent that the colonies declare independence."
Greatest,"Pip, a young orphan living with his sister and her husband in the marshes of Kent, sits in a cemetery one evening looking at his parents’ tombstones. Suddenly, an escaped convict springs up from behind a tombstone, grabs Pip, and orders him to bring him food and a file for his leg irons. Pip obeys, but the fearsome convict is soon captured anyway. The convict protects Pip by claiming to have stolen the items himself.
One day Pip is taken by his Uncle Pumblechook to play at Satis House, the home of the wealthy dowager Miss Havisham, who is extremely eccentric: she wears an old wedding dress everywhere she goes and keeps all the clocks in her house stopped at the same time. During his visit, he meets a beautiful young girl named Estella, who treats him coldly and contemptuously. Nevertheless, he falls in love with her and dreams of becoming a wealthy gentleman so that he might be worthy of her. He even hopes that Miss Havisham intends to make him a gentleman and marry him to Estella, but his hopes are dashed when, after months of regular visits to Satis House, Miss Havisham decides to help him become a common laborer in his family’s business.
With Miss Havisham’s guidance, Pip is apprenticed to his brother-in-law, Joe, who is the village blacksmith. Pip works in the forge unhappily, struggling to better his education with the help of the plain, kind Biddy and encountering Joe’s malicious day laborer, Orlick. One night, after an altercation with Orlick, Pip’s sister, known as Mrs. Joe, is viciously attacked and becomes a mute invalid. From her signals, Pip suspects that Orlick was responsible for the attack.
One day a lawyer named Jaggers appears with strange news: a secret benefactor has given Pip a large fortune, and Pip must come to London immediately to begin his education as a gentleman. Pip happily assumes that his previous hopes have come true—that Miss Havisham is his secret benefactor and that the old woman intends for him to marry Estella.
In London, Pip befriends a young gentleman named Herbert Pocket and Jaggers’s law clerk, Wemmick. He expresses disdain for his former friends and loved ones, especially Joe, but he continues to pine after Estella. He furthers his education by studying with the tutor Matthew Pocket, Herbert’s father. Herbert himself helps Pip learn how to act like a gentleman. When Pip turns twenty-one and begins to receive an income from his fortune, he will secretly help Herbert buy his way into the business he has chosen for himself. But for now, Herbert and Pip lead a fairly undisciplined life in London, enjoying themselves and running up debts. Orlick reappears in Pip’s life, employed as Miss Havisham’s porter, but is promptly fired by Jaggers after Pip reveals Orlick’s unsavory past. Mrs. Joe dies, and Pip goes home for the funeral, feeling tremendous grief and remorse. Several years go by, until one night a familiar figure barges into Pip’s room—the convict, Magwitch, who stuns Pip by announcing that he, not Miss Havisham, is the source of Pip’s fortune. He tells Pip that he was so moved by Pip’s boyhood kindness that he dedicated his life to making Pip a gentleman, and he made a fortune in Australia for that very purpose.
Pip is appalled, but he feels morally bound to help Magwitch escape London, as the convict is pursued both by the police and by Compeyson, his former partner in crime. A complicated mystery begins to fall into place when Pip discovers that Compeyson was the man who abandoned Miss Havisham at the altar and that Estella is Magwitch’s daughter. Miss Havisham has raised her to break men’s hearts, as revenge for the pain her own broken heart caused her. Pip was merely a boy for the young Estella to practice on; Miss Havisham delighted in Estella’s ability to toy with his affections.
As the weeks pass, Pip sees the good in Magwitch and begins to care for him deeply. Before Magwitch’s escape attempt, Estella marries an upper-class lout named Bentley Drummle. Pip makes a visit to Satis House, where Miss Havisham begs his forgiveness for the way she has treated him in the past, and he forgives her. Later that day, when she bends over the fireplace, her clothing catches fire and she goes up in flames. She survives but becomes an invalid. In her final days, she will continue to repent for her misdeeds and to plead for Pip’s forgiveness.
The time comes for Pip and his friends to spirit Magwitch away from London. Just before the escape attempt, Pip is called to a shadowy meeting in the marshes, where he encounters the vengeful, evil Orlick. Orlick is on the verge of killing Pip when Herbert arrives with a group of friends and saves Pip’s life. Pip and Herbert hurry back to effect Magwitch’s escape. They try to sneak Magwitch down the river on a rowboat, but they are discovered by the police, who Compeyson tipped off. Magwitch and Compeyson fight in the river, and Compeyson is drowned. Magwitch is sentenced to death, and Pip loses his fortune. Magwitch feels that his sentence is God’s forgiveness and dies at peace. Pip falls ill; Joe comes to London to care for him, and they are reconciled. Joe gives him the news from home: Orlick, after robbing Pumblechook, is now in jail; Miss Havisham has died and left most of her fortune to the Pockets; Biddy has taught Joe how to read and write. After Joe leaves, Pip decides to rush home after him and marry Biddy, but when he arrives there he discovers that she and Joe have already married.
Pip decides to go abroad with Herbert to work in the mercantile trade. Returning many years later, he encounters Estella in the ruined garden at Satis House. Drummle, her husband, treated her badly, but he is now dead. Pip finds that Estella’s coldness and cruelty have been replaced by a sad kindness, and the two leave the garden hand in hand, Pip believing that they will never part again. (Note: Dickens’s original ending to Great Expectations differed from the one described in this summary. The final Summary and Analysis section of this SparkNote provides a description of the first ending and explains why Dickens rewrote it.)"
Guaranties,"In a collection of essays, Malcolm Gladwell explores the relationship between power and prestige on the one hand and weakness and struggle on the other. Two theses run through the essays in David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants. The first thesis is that in a contest where one side is obviously superior to the other by conventional standards, the weaker side often has one or more underappreciated advantages. The second thesis is that too much strength can be a bad thing—a phenomenon represented graphically by an inverted-U curve: as strength increases along the horizontal axis, the benefit, on the vertical axis, at first rises but eventually begins to fall.
The Introduction and Part One develop both claims. The first example of hidden advantage on the weaker side is David, the Biblical shepherd boy, who uses a simple sling to overcome the heavily armored and physically imposing warrior Goliath. Later examples include an unskilled girls’ basketball team that wins games with the full-court press, and T. E. Lawrence and his Bedouin guerillas, who use sabotage and surprise to defeat the Turkish army during the First World War.
The moral is that weakness encourages innovation. The basketball team, for instance, adopts the full-court press because the team stands no chance of winning by playing the way other teams do. Gladwell also considers the value of being a Big Fish in a Little Pond instead of a Little Fish in a Big Pond. The French Impressionists found success by creating a Little Pond for themselves, in the form of a self-staged exhibition. Similarly, a college student choosing between a prestigious school and a less-prestigious one will often have a better experience, and will be more successful, at the latter.
A chapter primarily about school class sizes illustrates the concept of the inverted-U curve. According to conventional wisdom, students learn more in small classes than in large ones. This is true, according to Gladwell, for class sizes above twenty-five or so. But a class size of fifteen is smaller than ideal. Family income also illustrates the point: more income is good when it enables a family to afford necessities, but not when the added income makes it harder for parents to say “no” to their children.
Part Two of David and Goliath develops both themes further. Under the right circumstances, personal difficulty can promote the development of valuable skills. Gladwell illustrates this point using several people who grew up with dyslexia. Dyslexia forced trial lawyer David Boies to become an unusually good listener, and it forced film producer Brian Grazer to become an exceptional negotiator. In IKEA founder Ingvar Kamprad and investment banker Gary Cohn, dyslexia fostered a willingness to be “disagreeable”—to do things other disapprove of, like doing business in a communist country or lying your way into a job. A tragically deprived childhood had the same effect on medical pioneer Emil Freireich, who was willing to try treatment techniques that shocked and appalled his colleagues.
Brushes with danger can cause people to become physically more courageous. Here, Gladwell’s examples include the survivors of the London Blitz in World War II and civil rights leader Fred Shuttlesworth. Many of the examples in this section are also examples of inventiveness born of necessity. Freireich, for example, had to find ways to keep his young patients alive when existing techniques were of little use. Wyatt Walker, coordinator of the Birmingham civil rights protests, had to find a way to goad police chief Bull Connor into a response that would attract the country’s attention.
Part Three and the Afterword focus on the limits of government power. Again, the lesson of the inverted-U curve regularly applies. In Belfast, Northern Ireland, in the 1960s, the British government found that applying overwhelming force without establishing legitimacy in the eyes of the population was counterproductive. Conversely, a New York police unit demonstrated that legitimacy makes traditional policing techniques more effective. When it comes to the punishment of violent crime, Gladwell argues that overly harsh sentencing policies, like California’s Three Strikes law, do more harm than good. He makes his case partly with statistics and partly by describing the contrasting ways in which two parents of different murder victims each coped with their loss.
Gladwell’s last two examples are from times of war. During World War II, officials of Vichy France recognized the limits of their power when a small village openly refused to cooperate in the arrest and deportation of Jews. And during the Vietnam War, the U.S. government learned that despite the recommendations of a confident analyst from the RAND corporation, overwhelming financial and material superiority did not guarantee victory over the Viet Cong."
Office,"Stephen Dedalus spends the early morning hours of June 16, 1904, remaining aloof from his mocking friend, Buck Mulligan, and Buck’s English acquaintance, Haines. As Stephen leaves for work, Buck orders him to leave the house key and meet them at the pub at 12:30. Stephen resents Buck.
	Around 10:00 A.M., Stephen teaches a history lesson to his class at Garrett Deasy’s boys’ school. After class, Stephen meets with Deasy to receive his wages. The narrow-minded and prejudiced Deasy lectures Stephen on life. Stephen agrees to take Deasy’s editorial letter about cattle disease to acquaintances at the newspaper. 
	Stephen spends the remainder of his morning walking alone on Sandymount Strand, thinking critically about his younger self and about perception. He composes a poem in his head and writes it down on a scrap torn from Deasy’s letter. 
	At 8:00 A.M. the same morning, Leopold Bloom fixes breakfast and brings his wife her mail and breakfast in bed. One of her letters is from Molly’s concert tour manager, Blazes Boylan (Bloom suspects he is also Molly’s lover)—Boylan will visit at 4:00 this afternoon. Bloom returns downstairs, reads a letter from their daughter, Milly, then goes to the outhouse. 
	At 10:00 A.M., Bloom picks up an amorous letter from the post office—he is corresponding with a woman named Martha Clifford under the pseudonym Henry Flower. He reads the tepid letter, ducks briefly into a church, then orders Molly’s lotion from the pharmacist. He runs into Bantam Lyons, who mistakenly gets the impression that Bloom is giving him a tip on the horse Throwaway in the afternoon’s Gold Cup race.
	Around 11:00 A.M., Bloom rides with Simon Dedalus (Stephen’s father), Martin Cunningham, and Jack Power to the funeral of Paddy Dignam. The men treat Bloom as somewhat of an outsider. At the funeral, Bloom thinks about the deaths of his son and his father.
	At noon, we find Bloom at the offices of the Freeman newspaper, negotiating an advertisement for Keyes, a liquor merchant. Several idle men, including editor Myles Crawford, are hanging around in the office, discussing political speeches. Bloom leaves to secure the ad. Stephen arrives at the newspaper with Deasy’s letter. Stephen and the other men leave for the pub just as Bloom is returning. Bloom’s ad negotiation is rejected by Crawford on his way out.
	At 1:00 P.M., Bloom runs into Josie Breen, an old flame, and they discuss Mina Purefoy, who is in labor at the maternity hospital. Bloom stops in Burton’s restaurant, but he decides to move on to Davy Byrne’s for a light lunch. Bloom reminisces about an intimate afternoon with Molly on Howth. Bloom leaves and is walking toward the National Library when he spots Boylan on the street and ducks into the National Museum.
	At 2:00 P.M., Stephen is informally presenting his “Hamlet theory” in the National Library to the poet A.E. and the librarians John Eglinton, Best, and Lyster. A.E. is dismissive of Stephen’s theory and leaves. Buck enters and jokingly scolds Stephen for failing to meet him and Haines at the pub. On the way out, Buck and Stephen pass Bloom, who has come to obtain a copy of Keyes’ ad.
	At 4:00 P.M., Simon Dedalus, Ben Dollard, Lenehan, and Blazes Boylan converge at the Ormond Hotel bar. Bloom notices Boylan’s car outside and decides to watch him. Boylan soon leaves for his appointment with Molly, and Bloom sits morosely in the Ormond restaurant—he is briefly mollified by Dedalus’s and Dollard’s singing. Bloom writes back to Martha, then leaves to post the letter.
	At 5:00 P.M., Bloom arrives at Barney Kiernan’s pub to meet Martin Cunningham about the Dignam family finances, but Cunningham has not yet arrived. The citizen, a belligerent Irish nationalist, becomes increasingly drunk and begins attacking Bloom’s Jewishness. Bloom stands up to the citizen, speaking in favor of peace and love over xenophobic violence. Bloom and the citizen have an altercation on the street before Cunningham’s carriage carries Bloom away.
	Bloom relaxes on Sandymount Strand around sunset, after his visit to Mrs. Dignam’s house nearby. A young woman, Gerty MacDowell, notices Bloom watching her from across the beach. Gerty subtly reveals more and more of her legs while Bloom surreptitiously masturbates. Gerty leaves, and Bloom dozes. 
	At 10:00 P.M., Bloom wanders to the maternity hospital to check on Mina Purefoy. Also at the hospital are Stephen and several of his medi-c-al student friends, drinking and talking boisterously about subjects related to birth. Bloom agrees to join them, though he privately disapproves of their revelry in light of Mrs. Purefoy’s struggles upstairs. Buck arrives, and the men proceed to Burke’s pub. At closing time, Stephen convinces his friend Lynch to go to the brothel section of town and Bloom follows, feeling protective.
	Bloom finally locates Stephen and Lynch at Bella Cohen’s brothel. Stephen is drunk and imagines that he sees the ghost of his mother—full of rage, he shatters a lamp with his walking stick. Bloom runs after Stephen and finds him in an argument with a British soldier who knocks him out.
	Bloom revives Stephen and takes him for coffee at a cabman’s shelter to sober up. Bloom invites Stephen back to his house.
	Well after midnight, Stephen and Bloom arrive back at Bloom’s house. They drink cocoa and talk about their respective backgrounds. Bloom asks Stephen to stay the night. Stephen politely refuses. Bloom sees him out and comes back in to find evidence of Boylan’s visit. Still, Bloom is at peace with the world and he climbs into bed, tells Molly of his day and requests breakfast in bed. 
After Bloom falls asleep, Molly remains awake, surprised by Bloom’s request for breakfast in bed. Her mind wanders to her childhood in Gibraltar, her afternoon of sex with Boylan, her singing career, Stephen Dedalus. Her thoughts of Bloom vary wildly over the course of the monologue, but it ends with a reminiscence of their intimate moment at Howth and a positive affirmation."
Hard,"Thomas Gradgrind, a wealthy, retired merchant in the industrial city of Coketown, England, devotes his life to a philosophy of rationalism, self-interest, and fact. He raises his oldest children, Louisa and Tom, according to this philosophy and never allows them to engage in fanciful or imaginative pursuits. He founds a school and charitably takes in one of the students, the kindly and imaginative Sissy Jupe, after the disappearance of her father, a circus entertainer.
	As the Gradgrind children grow older, Tom becomes a dissipated, self-interested hedonist, and Louisa struggles with deep inner confusion, feeling as though she is missing something important in her life. Eventually Louisa marries Gradgrind’s friend Josiah Bounderby, a wealthy factory owner and banker more than twice her age. Bounderby continually trumpets his role as a self-made man who was abandoned in the gutter by his mother as an infant. Tom is apprenticed at the Bounderby bank, and Sissy remains at the Gradgrind home to care for the younger children.
	In the meantime, an impoverished “Hand”—Dickens’s term for the lowest laborers in Coketown’s factories—named Stephen Blackpool struggles with his love for Rachael, another poor factory worker. He is unable to marry her because he is already married to a horrible, drunken woman who disappears for months and even years at a time. Stephen visits Bounderby to ask about a divorce but learns that only the wealthy can obtain them. Outside Bounderby’s home, he meets Mrs. Pegler, a strange old woman with an inexplicable devotion to Bounderby.
	James Harthouse, a wealthy young sophisticate from London, arrives in Coketown to begin a political career as a disciple of Gradgrind, who is now a Member of Parliament. He immediately takes an interest in Louisa and decides to try to seduce her. With the unspoken aid of Mrs. Sparsit, a former aristocrat who has fallen on hard times and now works for Bounderby, he sets about trying to corrupt Louisa.
	The Hands, exhorted by a crooked union spokesman named Slackbridge, try to form a union. Only Stephen refuses to join because he feels that a union strike would only increase tensions between employers and employees. He is cast out by the other Hands and fired by Bounderby when he refuses to spy on them. Louisa, impressed with Stephen’s integrity, visits him before he leaves Coketown and helps him with some money. Tom accompanies her and tells Stephen that if he waits outside the bank for several consecutive nights, help will come to him. Stephen does so, but no help arrives. Eventually he packs up and leaves Coketown, hoping to find agricultural work in the country. Not long after that, the bank is robbed, and the lone suspect is Stephen, the vanished Hand who was seen loitering outside the bank for several nights just before disappearing from the city.
	Mrs. Sparsit witnesses Harthouse declaring his love for Louisa, and Louisa agrees to meet him in Coketown later that night. However, Louisa instead flees to her father’s house, where she miserably confides to Gradgrind that her upbringing has left her married to a man she does not love, disconnected from her feelings, deeply unhappy, and possibly in love with Harthouse. She collapses to the floor, and Gradgrind, struck dumb with self-reproach, begins to realize the imperfections in his philosophy of rational self-interest.
	Sissy, who loves Louisa deeply, visits Harthouse and convinces him to leave Coketown forever. Bounderby, furious that his wife has left him, redoubles his efforts to capture Stephen. When Stephen tries to return to clear his good name, he falls into a mining pit called Old Hell Shaft. Rachael and Louisa discover him, but he dies soon after an emotional farewell to Rachael. Gradgrind and Louisa realize that Tom is really responsible for robbing the bank, and they arrange to sneak him out of England with the help of the circus performers with whom Sissy spent her early childhood. They are nearly successful, but are stopped by Bitzer, a young man who went to Gradgrind’s school and who embodies all the qualities of the detached rationalism that Gradgrind once espoused, but who now sees its limits. Sleary, the lisping circus proprietor, arranges for Tom to slip out of Bitzer’s grasp, and the young robber escapes from England after all.
	Mrs. Sparsit, anxious to help Bounderby find the robbers, drags Mrs. Pegler—a known associate of Stephen Blackpool—in to see Bounderby, thinking Mrs. Pegler is a potential witness. Bounderby recoils, and it is revealed that Mrs. Pegler is really his loving mother, whom he has forbidden to visit him: Bounderby is not a self-made man after all. Angrily, Bounderby fires Mrs. Sparsit and sends her away to her hostile relatives. Five years later, he will die alone in the streets of Coketown. Gradgrind gives up his philosophy of fact and devotes his political power to helping the poor. Tom realizes the error of his ways but dies without ever seeing his family again. While Sissy marries and has a large and loving family, Louisa never again marries and never has children. Nevertheless, Louisa is loved by Sissy’s family and learns at last how to feel sympathy for her fellow human beings."
Devise,"Ten years have passed since the fall of Troy, and the Greek hero Odysseus still has not returned to his kingdom in Ithaca. A large and rowdy mob of suitors who have overrun Odysseus’s palace and pillaged his land continue to court his wife, Penelope. She has remained faithful to Odysseus. Prince Telemachus, Odysseus’s son, wants desperately to throw them out but does not have the confidence or experience to fight them. One of the suitors, Antinous, plans to assassinate the young prince, eliminating the only opposition to their dominion over the palace.
Read more about The Odyssey’s precursor, The Iliad.
Unknown to the suitors, Odysseus is still alive. The beautiful nymph Calypso, possessed by love for him, has imprisoned him on her island, Ogygia. He longs to return to his wife and son, but he has no ship or crew to help him escape. While the gods and goddesses of Mount Olympus debate Odysseus’s future, Athena, Odysseus’s strongest supporter among the gods, resolves to help Telemachus. Disguised as a friend of the prince’s grandfather, Laertes, she convinces the prince to call a meeting of the assembly at which he reproaches the suitors. Athena also prepares him for a great journey to Pylos and Sparta, where the kings Nestor and Menelaus, Odysseus’s companions during the war, inform him that Odysseus is alive and trapped on Calypso’s island. Telemachus makes plans to return home, while, back in Ithaca, Antinous and the other suitors prepare an ambush to kill him when he reaches port.
On Mount Olympus, Zeus sends Hermes to rescue Odysseus from Calypso. Hermes persuades Calypso to let Odysseus build a ship and leave. The homesick hero sets sail, but when Poseidon, god of the sea, finds him sailing home, he sends a storm to wreck Odysseus’s ship. Poseidon has harbored a bitter grudge against Odysseus since the hero blinded his son, the Cyclops Polyphemus, earlier in his travels. Athena intervenes to save Odysseus from Poseidon’s wrath, and the beleaguered king lands at Scheria, home of the Phaeacians. Nausicaa, the Phaeacian princess, shows him to the royal palace, and Odysseus receives a warm welcome from the king and queen. When he identifies himself as Odysseus, his hosts, who have heard of his exploits at Troy, are stunned. They promise to give him safe passage to Ithaca, but first they beg to hear the story of his adventures.
Odysseus spends the night describing the fantastic chain of events leading up to his arrival on Calypso’s island. He recounts his trip to the Land of the Lotus Eaters, his battle with Polyphemus the Cyclops, his love affair with the witch-goddess Circe, his temptation by the deadly Sirens, his journey into Hades to consult the prophet Tiresias, and his fight with the sea monster Scylla. When he finishes his story, the Phaeacians return Odysseus to Ithaca, where he seeks out the hut of his faithful swineherd, Eumaeus. Though Athena has disguised Odysseus as a beggar, Eumaeus warmly receives and nourishes him in the hut. He soon encounters Telemachus, who has returned from Pylos and Sparta despite the suitors’ ambush, and reveals to him his true identity. Odysseus and Telemachus devise a plan to massacre the suitors and regain control of Ithaca.
When Odysseus arrives at the palace the next day, still disguised as a beggar, he endures abuse and insults from the suitors. The only person who recognizes him is his old nurse, Eurycleia, but she swears not to disclose his secret. Penelope takes an interest in this strange beggar, suspecting that he might be her long-lost husband. Quite crafty herself, Penelope organizes an archery contest the following day and promises to marry any man who can string Odysseus’s great bow and fire an arrow through a row of twelve axes—a feat that only Odysseus has ever been able to accomplish. At the contest, each suitor tries to string the bow and fails. Odysseus steps up to the bow and, with little effort, fires an arrow through all twelve axes. He then turns the bow on the suitors. He and Telemachus, assisted by a few faithful servants, kill every last suitor.
Odysseus reveals himself to the entire palace and reunites with his loving Penelope. He travels to the outskirts of Ithaca to see his aging father, Laertes. They come under attack from the vengeful family members of the dead suitors, but Laertes, reinvigorated by his son’s return, successfully kills Antinous’s father and puts a stop to the attack. Zeus dispatches Athena to restore peace. With his power secure and his family reunited, Odysseus’s long ordeal comes to an end."
Discover,"Jack Worthing, the play’s protagonist, is a pillar of the community in Hertfordshire, where he is guardian to Cecily Cardew, the pretty, eighteen-year-old granddaughter of the late Thomas Cardew, who found and adopted Jack when he was a baby. In Hertfordshire, Jack has responsibilities: he is a major landowner and justice of the peace, with tenants, farmers, and a number of servants and other employees all dependent on him. For years, he has also pretended to have an irresponsible black-sheep brother named Ernest who leads a scandalous life in pursuit of pleasure and is always getting into trouble of a sort that requires Jack to rush grimly off to his assistance. In fact, Ernest is merely Jack’s alibi, a phantom that allows him to disappear for days at a time and do as he likes. No one but Jack knows that he himself is Ernest. Ernest is the name Jack goes by in London, which is where he really goes on these occasions—probably to pursue the very sort of behavior he pretends to disapprove of in his imaginary brother.
Jack is in love with Gwendolen Fairfax, the cousin of his best friend, Algernon Moncrieff. When the play opens, Algernon, who knows Jack as Ernest, has begun to suspect something, having found an inscription inside Jack’s cigarette case addressed to “Uncle Jack” from someone who refers to herself as “little Cecily.” Algernon suspects that Jack may be leading a double life, a practice he seems to regard as commonplace and indispensable to modern life. He calls a person who leads a double life a “Bunburyist,” after a nonexistent friend he pretends to have, a chronic invalid named Bunbury, to whose deathbed he is forever being summoned whenever he wants to get out of some tiresome social obligation.
At the beginning of Act 1, Jack drops in unexpectedly on Algernon and announces that he intends to propose to Gwendolen. Algernon confronts him with the cigarette case and forces him to come clean, demanding to know who “Jack” and “Cecily” are. Jack confesses that his name isn’t really Ernest and that Cecily is his ward, a responsibility imposed on him by his adoptive father’s will. Jack also tells Algernon about his fictional brother. Jack says he’s been thinking of killing off this fake brother, since Cecily has been showing too active an interest in him. Without meaning to, Jack describes Cecily in terms that catch Algernon’s attention and make him even more interested in her than he is already.
Gwendolen and her mother, Lady Bracknell, arrive, which gives Jack an opportunity to propose to Gwendolen. Jack is delighted to discover that Gwendolen returns his affections, but he is alarmed to learn that Gwendolen is fixated on the name Ernest, which she says “inspires absolute confidence.” Gwendolen makes clear that she would not consider marrying a man who was not named Ernest.
Lady Bracknell interviews Jack to determine his eligibility as a possible son-in-law, and during this interview she asks about his family background. When Jack explains that he has no idea who his parents were and that he was found, by the man who adopted him, in a handbag in the cloakroom at Victoria Station, Lady Bracknell is scandalized. She forbids the match between Jack and Gwendolen and sweeps out of the house.
In Act 2, Algernon shows up at Jack’s country estate posing as Jack’s brother Ernest. Meanwhile, Jack, having decided that Ernest has outlived his usefulness, arrives home in deep mourning, full of a story about Ernest having died suddenly in Paris. He is enraged to find Algernon there masquerading as Ernest but has to go along with the charade. If he doesn’t, his own lies and deceptions will be revealed.
While Jack changes out of his mourning clothes, Algernon, who has fallen hopelessly in love with Cecily, asks her to marry him. He is surprised to discover that Cecily already considers that they are engaged, and he is charmed when she reveals that her fascination with “Uncle Jack’s brother” led her to invent an elaborate romance between herself and him several months ago. Algernon is less enchanted to learn that part of Cecily’s interest in him derives from the name Ernest, which, unconsciously echoing Gwendolen, she says “inspires absolute confidence.”
Algernon goes off in search of Dr. Chasuble, the local rector, to see about getting himself christened Ernest. Meanwhile, Gwendolen arrives, having decided to pay Jack an unexpected visit. Gwendolen is shown into the garden, where Cecily orders tea and attempts to play hostess. Cecily has no idea how Gwendolen figures into Jack’s life, and Gwendolen, for her part, has no idea who Cecily is. Gwendolen initially thinks Cecily is a visitor to the Manor House and is disconcerted to learn that Cecily is “Mr. Worthing’s ward.” She notes that Ernest has never mentioned having a ward, and Cecily explains that it is not Ernest Worthing who is her guardian but his brother Jack and, in fact, that she is engaged to be married to Ernest Worthing. Gwendolen points out that this is impossible as she herself is engaged to Ernest Worthing. The tea party degenerates into a war of manners.
Jack and Algernon arrive toward the climax of this confrontation, each having separately made arrangements with Dr. Chasuble to be christened Ernest later that day. Each of the young ladies points out that the other has been deceived: Cecily informs Gwendolen that her fiancé is really named Jack and Gwendolen informs Cecily that hers is really called Algernon. The two women demand to know where Jack’s brother Ernest is, since both of them are engaged to be married to him. Jack is forced to admit that he has no brother and that Ernest is a complete fiction. Both women are shocked and furious, and they retire to the house arm in arm.
Act 3 takes place in the drawing room of the Manor House, where Cecily and Gwendolen have retired. When Jack and Algernon enter from the garden, the two women confront them. Cecily asks Algernon why he pretended to be her guardian’s brother. Algernon tells her he did it in order to meet her. Gwendolen asks Jack whether he pretended to have a brother in order to come into London to see her as often as possible, and she interprets his evasive reply as an affirmation. The women are somewhat appeased but still concerned over the issue of the name. However, when Jack and Algernon tell Gwendolen and Cecily that they have both made arrangements to be christened Ernest that afternoon, all is forgiven and the two pairs of lovers embrace. At this moment, Lady Bracknell’s arrival is announced.
Lady Bracknell has followed Gwendolen from London, having bribed Gwendolen’s maid to reveal her destination. She demands to know what is going on. Gwendolen again informs Lady Bracknell of her engagement to Jack, and Lady Bracknell reiterates that a union between them is out of the question. Algernon tells Lady Bracknell of his engagement to Cecily, prompting her to inspect Cecily and inquire into her social connections, which she does in a routine and patronizing manner that infuriates Jack. He replies to all her questions with a mixture of civility and sarcasm, withholding until the last possible moment the information that Cecily is actually worth a great deal of money and stands to inherit still more when she comes of age. At this, Lady Bracknell becomes genuinely interested.
Jack informs Lady Bracknell that, as Cecily’s legal guardian, he refuses to give his consent to her union with Algernon. Lady Bracknell suggests that the two young people simply wait until Cecily comes of age, and Jack points out that under the terms of her grandfather’s will, Cecily does not legally come of age until she is thirty-five. Lady Bracknell asks Jack to reconsider, and he points out that the matter is entirely in her own hands. As soon as she consents to his marriage to Gwendolen, Cecily can have his consent to marry Algernon. However, Lady Bracknell refuses to entertain the notion. She and Gwendolen are on the point of leaving when Dr. Chasuble arrives and happens to mention Cecily’s governess, Miss Prism. At this, Lady Bracknell starts and asks that Miss Prism be sent for.
When the governess arrives and catches sight of Lady Bracknell, she begins to look guilty and furtive. Lady Bracknell accuses her of having left her sister’s house twenty-eight years before with a baby and never returned. She demands to know where the baby is. Miss Prism confesses she doesn’t know, explaining that she lost the baby, having absentmindedly placed it in a handbag in which she had meant to place the manuscript for a novel she had written. Jack asks what happened to the bag, and Miss Prism says she left it in the cloakroom of a railway station. Jack presses her for further details and goes racing offstage, returning a few moments later with a large handbag. When Miss Prism confirms that the bag is hers, Jack throws himself on her with a cry of “Mother!” It takes a while before the situation is sorted out, but before too long we understand that Jack is not the illegitimate child of Miss Prism but the legitimate child of Lady Bracknell’s sister and, therefore, Algernon’s older brother. Furthermore, Jack had been originally christened “Ernest John.” All these years Jack has unwittingly been telling the truth: Ernest is his name, as is Jack, and he does have an unprincipled younger brother—Algernon. Again the couples embrace, Miss Prism and Dr. Chasuble follow suit, and Jack acknowledges that he now understands “the vital Importance of Being Earnest.”"
South,"A Raisin in the Sun portrays a few weeks in the life of the Youngers, a Black family living on the South Side of Chicago in the 1950s. When the play opens, the Youngers are about to receive an insurance check for $10,000. This money comes from the deceased Mr. Younger’s life insurance policy. Each of the adult members of the family has an idea as to what he or she would like to do with this money. The matriarch of the family, Mama, wants to buy a house to fulfill a dream she shared with her husband. Mama’s son, Walter Lee, would rather use the money to invest in a liquor store with his friends. He believes that the investment will solve the family’s financial problems forever. Walter’s wife, Ruth, agrees with Mama, however, and hopes that she and Walter can provide more space and opportunity for their son, Travis. Finally, Beneatha, Walter’s sister and Mama’s daughter, wants to use the money for her medical school tuition. She also wishes that her family members were not so interested in assimilating into the white world. Beneatha instead tries to find her identity by looking back to the past and to Africa.
As the play progresses, the Youngers clash over their competing dreams. Ruth discovers that she is pregnant but fears that if she has the child, she will put more financial pressure on her family members. When Walter says nothing to Ruth’s admission that she is considering abortion, Mama puts a down payment on a house for the whole family. She believes that a bigger, brighter dwelling will help them all. This house is in Clybourne Park, an entirely white neighborhood. When the Youngers’ future neighbors find out that the Youngers are moving in, they send Mr. Lindner, from the Clybourne Park Improvement Association, to offer the Youngers money in return for staying away. The Youngers refuse the deal, even after Walter loses the rest of the money ($6,500) to his friend Willy Harris, who persuades Walter to invest in the liquor store and then runs off with his cash.
In the meantime, Beneatha rejects her suitor, George Murchison, whom she believes to be shallow and blind to the problems of race. Subsequently, she receives a marriage proposal from her Nigerian boyfriend, Joseph Asagai, who wants Beneatha to get a medical degree and move to Africa with him (Beneatha does not make her choice before the end of the play). The Youngers eventually move out of the apartment, fulfilling the family’s long-held dream. Their future seems uncertain and slightly dangerous, but they are optimistic and determined to live a better life. They believe that they can succeed if they stick together as a family and resolve to defer their dreams no longer."

Degrees,"Guy Montag is a fireman who burns books in a futuristic American city. In Montag’s world, firemen start fires rather than putting them out. The people in this society do not read books, enjoy nature, spend time by themselves, think independently, or have meaningful conversations. Instead, they drive very fast, watch excessive amounts of television on wall-size sets, and listen to the radio on “Seashell Radio” sets attached to their ears.
Montag encounters a gentle seventeen-year-old girl named Clarisse McClellan, who opens his eyes to the emptiness of his life with her innocently penetrating questions and her unusual love of people and nature. Over the next few days, Montag experiences a series of disturbing events. First, his wife, Mildred, attempts suicide by swallowing a bottle of sleeping pills. Then, when he responds to an alarm that an old woman has a stash of hidden literature, the woman shocks him by choosing to be burned alive along with her books. A few days later, he hears that Clarisse has been killed by a speeding car. Montag’s dissatisfaction with his life increases, and he begins to search for a solution in a stash of books that he has stolen from his own fires and hidden inside an air-conditioning vent.
When Montag fails to show up for work, his fire chief, Beatty, pays a visit to his house. Beatty explains that it’s normal for a fireman to go through a phase of wondering what books have to offer, and he delivers a dizzying monologue explaining how books came to be banned in the first place. According to Beatty, special-interest groups and other “minorities” objected to books that offended them. Soon, books all began to look the same, as writers tried to avoid offending anybody. This was not enough, however, and society as a whole decided to simply burn books rather than permit conflicting opinions. Beatty tells Montag to take twenty-four hours or so to see if his stolen books contain anything worthwhile and then turn them in for incineration. Montag begins a long and frenzied night of reading.
Overwhelmed by the task of reading, Montag looks to his wife for help and support, but she prefers television to her husband’s company and cannot understand why he would want to take the terrible risk of reading books. He remembers that he once met a retired English professor named Faber sitting in a park, and he decides that this man might be able to help him understand what he reads. He visits Faber, who tells him that the value of books lies in the detailed awareness of life that they contain. Faber says that Montag needs not only books but also the leisure to read them and the freedom to act upon their ideas.
Faber agrees to help Montag with his reading, and they concoct a risky scheme to overthrow the status quo. Faber will contact a printer and begin reproducing books, and Montag will plant books in the homes of firemen to discredit the profession and to destroy the machinery of censorship. Faber gives him a two-way radio earpiece (the “green bullet”) so that he can hear what Montag hears and talk to him secretly.
Montag goes home, and soon two of his wife’s friends arrive to watch television. The women discuss their families and the war that is about to be declared in an extremely frivolous manner. Their superficiality angers him, and he takes out a book of poetry and reads “Dover Beach” by Matthew Arnold. Faber buzzes in his ear for him to be quiet, and Mildred tries to explain that the poetry reading is a standard way for firemen to demonstrate the uselessness of literature. The women are extremely disturbed by the poem and leave to file a complaint against Montag.
Montag goes to the fire station and hands over one of his books to Beatty. Beatty confuses Montag by barraging him with contradictory quotations from great books. Beatty exploits these contradictions to show that literature is morbid and dangerously complex, and that it deserves incineration. Suddenly, the alarm sounds, and they rush off to answer the call, only to find that the alarm is at Montag’s own house. Mildred gets into a cab with her suitcase, and Montag realizes that his own wife has betrayed him.
Beatty forces Montag to burn the house himself; when he is done, Beatty places him under arrest. When Beatty continues to berate Montag, Montag turns the flamethrower on his superior and proceeds to burn him to ashes. Montag knocks the other firemen unconscious and runs. The Mechanical Hound, a monstrous machine that Beatty has set to attack Montag, pounces and injects Montag’s leg with a large dose of anesthetic. Montag manages to destroy it with his flamethrower; then he walks off the numbness in his leg and escapes with some books that were hidden in his backyard. He hides these in another fireman’s house and calls in an alarm from a pay phone.
Montag goes to Faber’s house, where he learns that a new Hound has been put on his trail, along with several helicopters and a television crew. Faber tells Montag that he is leaving for St. Louis to see a retired printer who may be able to help them. Montag gives Faber some money and tells him how to remove Montag’s scent from his house so the Hound will not enter it. Montag then takes some of Faber’s old clothes and runs off toward the river. The whole city watches as the chase unfolds on TV, but Montag manages to escape in the river and change into Faber’s clothes to disguise his scent. He drifts downstream into the country and follows a set of abandoned railroad tracks until he finds a group of renegade intellectuals (“the Book People”), led by a man named Granger, who welcome him. They are a part of a nationwide network of book lovers who have memorized many great works of literature and philosophy. They hope that they may be of some help to mankind in the aftermath of the war that has just been declared. Montag’s role is to memorize the Book of Ecclesiastes. Enemy jets appear in the sky and completely obliterate the city with bombs. Montag and his new friends move on to search for survivors and rebuild civilization."
Silently,"Shūsaku Endō’s Silence takes place in Japan during the 1600s, shortly after the Japanese government suppressed the Shimabara Rebellion, in which Christian Japanese peasants rebelled against the government’s heavy persecution. After the rebellion’s defeat, many Catholics went underground, continuing to practice their religion in secrecy. The novel begins when a young Portuguese Jesuit missionary, Sebastian Rodrigues, and his two colleagues, Father Garrpe and Father de Santa Maria, decide to set out to Japan to find out what happened to their teacher, Father Ferreira. Ferreira is rumored to have apostatized, or renounced his religious beliefs, after having gone underground in Japan and spent thirty years in Christian service there. Rodrigues finds it hard to believe that Ferreira, a highly respected member of the Jesuit community, has renounced his faith. If he has, Rodrigues wonders what this means about his faith in Christianity and the religion he has dedicated his life to.
Rodrigues, Garrpe, and de Santa Maria head to Japan by way of the Chinese port city Macao. There, they meet with Father Valignano, a rector of the Jesuit college in the city. Valignano is against sending the priests to Japan—a new magistrate, Inoue, is rumored to be especially brutal, exacting and devising some of the most brutal forms of Christian persecution ever performed. Rodrigues persists, and Valignano relents, sympathizing with Rodrigues’s desire to find out about Ferreira once and for all. The men arrange for a ship and hire a Japanese man they find wandering around town, Kichijiro, as a guide and interpreter. Kichijiro turns out to be a lazy drunk—he pretends to work when people are watching him but otherwise lies around drinking. During a violent storm, the men catch Kichijiro muttering Latin prayers and ask him if he is Catholic, but Kichijiro remains silent, though he has a pained look on his face. De Santa Maria, sick with suspected malaria, stays behind.
The men arrive at the village of Tomogi, where they find the villagers are practicing Christianity in secret. Two men in particular, Mokichi and Ichizo, are respected Christian leaders in the town. The men help situate Rodrigues and Garrpe in a charcoal hut on the hillside, away from the authorities. There, Rodrigues and Garrpe perform mass and hear confessions. Meanwhile, Kichijiro spreads the word to other towns that the priests have arrived, and villagers from other towns come to the priests’ hut. Soon, the government finds out that Christian priests have arrived, and a group of guards come to search the village. The officials demand that the town turn over the priests in three days and in the meantime select three hostages for the guards to take away. Mokichi and Ichizo volunteer, while the village selects Kichijiro as a third. Crestfallen and angry, Kichijiro joins the men in Nagasaki, where they are forced to apostatize at the magistrate’s office. Only Kichijiro apostatizes. Mokichi and Ichizo are returned to Tomogi, where they are subjected to the water torture and left to die. Rodrigues watches the whole affair from his hut, wondering why God is silent in the face of such meaningless suffering. For the first time, Rodrigues questions his faith.
Rodrigues and Garrpe decide to split up to avoid capture. Rodrigues wanders an abandoned village where he finds Kichijiro again, begging for absolution for his sin. Rodrigues is confused by Kichijiro and wonders if he’s about to trap him. His suspicions turn out to be correct—Kichijiro has led a group of soldiers to Rodrigues that entraps him and brings him to prison. At the prison, Rodrigues is surprised to find the guards allow him to practice his priestly duties. He wonders why they are treating him so kindly. Rodrigues is brought before a tribunal of samurai who cross-examine Rodrigues. Rodrigues argues his case that Christianity is a “universal truth” that deserves to be spread to Japan, but one samurai gently argues that this isn’t the case—Christianity cannot thrive in Japan, and it’s not needed there. Rodrigues is shocked to find the man arguing before him is Inoue, the man rumored for his heinous cruelty. Inoue says he doesn’t intend to kill anyone without sufficient reason, and he’s hoping that Rodrigues instead comes to reason and decides to apostatize.
Several days later, at Inoue’s request, Rodrigues is brought by the Interpreter to an overlook of the ocean. Rodrigues watches as a group of prisoners are led to the shore, where they are wrapped in straw mats and loaded onto a boat. With them is Garrpe. The guards below order Garrpe to apostatize, but he refuses. The guards then row the boat out to dump the prisoners overboard. Garrpe swims after them in a panic and drowns. As Rodrigues watches the horrible scene unfold, the Interpreter tells him that the prisoners’ blood is on the priests’ hands. To add insult to injury, he adds that Garrpe at least showed bravery, while Rodrigues sits in silence, doing nothing for the peasants. Rodrigues sits for days in prison, numb to his situation and God’s persistent silence. He is then brought to meet Ferreira, whom he learns has taken a Japanese name and is writing a book against Christianity. Rodrigues is shocked—he can’t believe his former teacher has apostatized and now works for the Japanese government. Ferreira, visibly shaken, argues that apostasy is inevitable since Christianity is incompatible with Eastern views.
Finally, Rodrigues is taken to prison in Inoue’s house. There, he struggles to decide whether to apostatize. While sitting in his cell, he hears the sounds of what he thinks is snoring, but Ferreira, who is sitting outside Rodrigues’s cell, tells him it’s not snoring but the sound of Christians being hung upside down in a pit and tortured until Rodrigues gives in. Rodrigues, overcome, decides to apostatize. He can’t bear to let any more people suffer on his behalf. Rodrigues is taken to Nagasaki, where he is given a new Japanese name and wife. He and Ferreira live out their days employed by the government helping identify smuggled Christian goods that come in via European ships. Kichijiro comes to Rodrigues’s door one last time asking for forgiveness. Rodrigues agrees, resolved that he has come to a deeper understanding of faith in his heart, and for this reason, is a true testament to the faith, even within Japan’s borders."
Well,"A Long Walk to Water weaves together the stories of two young people, both of whom are from southern Sudan. 
We first meet eleven-year old Nya. It is 2008, and she spends her days fetching water for her family. Every day, Nya travels back and forth from her village to the pond, not once but twice. 
Next, we meet Salva, also eleven years old, but the year is 1985. He sits in the schoolhouse, not far from his family’s village. At the sound of gunshots, Salva flees into the bush. War between the government and the rebels has reached his village. He walks for hours with others who are fleeing and joins a group from his village, Loun-Ariik, but his family is not among them. Soldiers lead them to the rebel camp. Salva, forced to join the group of women and children, spends the night in a barn. When he wakes up, the others have gone and he is alone. A woman from Salva’s tribe, the Dinka, befriends him. Four days later, she prepares to leave and will not take Salva with her. Strangers approach who are Dinka, but Salva’s family is not among them.
As we alternate back and forth between stories, we learn that Nya’s family must move to a camp near a lake for the dry season. It is a three-day journey from her village. Their tribe, the Nuer, fight with the rival Dinka tribe over the land near the lake, so it is too dangerous to live near the lake year-round. Every day for five months, Nya digs for water in the lake. Her father and Dep, her brother, hunt, hoping not to encounter men from the Dinka tribe. When Nya’s sister, Akeer, becomes sick, Nya and her mother travel with her to the nearest medical clinic, a several day’s walk away. Akeer receives medicine and recovers, but her sickness, the nurse tells them, came from the water, and now Nya’s family must boil their water to destroy the germs. 
When we return to Salva, he has been walking for weeks. He meets Buksa, from the Jur-chol tribe, who leads the group to a beehive. With his energy renewed from honey and beeswax, Salva continues walking, and meets Marial, a Dinka who also has not found his family. One day, Salva hears someone calling his name. It is his Uncle Jewiir. Uncle promises to take care of Salva. He has a gun and can protect Salva as they travel through the land of the Aruot, “people of the lion.” Soon afterward, Marial disappears in the middle of the night, the victim of a lion attack. Salva, crippled with grief at the loss of his friend and by his thorn-torn feet, staggers on, coaxed by his uncle to take “a step at a time.” The group crosses the Nile River and begin the treacherous journey across the Akobo desert. After several days, armed men from the Nuer tribe confront the group, and kill Uncle. Though Salva mourns the loss of Marial and Uncle, he feels their strength. He reaches a refugee camp in Ethiopia and searches for his family.
When we pick up the thread of Nya’s story, the rainy season has come and Nya’s family has returned to their village. One day, two men visit and speak with Nya’s uncle, the chief of the village. The strangers survey an area between two large trees and decide that this is where they will find water. After the two men leave, villagers begin clearing the land. Men and trucks have arrived at the village with a large drill, plastic pipes, and other equipment. Nya continues her walk to and from the pond. 
Salva’s story continues. In 1991, he is almost seventeen, and still in the refugee camp. However, war has come to Ethiopia and the soldiers force the refugees into the crocodile-infested Gilo River. Salva survives the crossing and finds himself the leader of over a thousand boys traveling to Kenya. The journey will take a year and a half. 
Fast forward to 2009 where drilling continues in Nya’s village. Workers need water to operate the drill, so they bring water in trucks from the pond to the site. When discouraged, their leader encourages them. On the third day of drilling, Nya hears a loud whoosh sound. Water shoots out of the hole. People cheer. The water that gushes forth is muddy, but soon becomes clear. Nya continues to walk to the pond while the men finish the well. Meanwhile, men from the village begin clearing the land near the second tree, preparing the land to build a school. Soon, Nya will spend her days at school rather than fetching water.
When we rejoin Salva, he is twenty-two years old, and living in the Ifo refugee camp in Kenya. Michael, an aid worker, teaches him English. Michael tells him that 3,000 men will be chosen to go to the United States. Weeks later, Salva’s name is among the list of the men chosen.
The year is 1996. On the journey to America, Salva learns that he is a Lost Boy, one of the many who have lost their families and homes in the war. Six years later, Salva is living with his adopted family in Rochester, New York, going to college, and studying business. He learns that his father is alive, recovering from surgery in a United Nations clinic in Sudan. Salva journeys to Sudan and after nineteen years apart, reunites with his father. He learns that his mother and sisters, Akit and Agnath, are alive. Two of his brothers, Ariik and Kuol are dead, but Ring is alive. Salva returns to the United States with a plan. Three years later, his goal is near. 
Back at Nya’s village, the well is finished. Villagers gather around as the crew’s leader holds up a sign. It says Elm Street School, the school in the United States whose students have raised the money for the well. Nya lines up to fill her bottle as her uncle works the pump. She drinks the clean, cool water. The leader watches the villagers from a distance. He is Dinka, Dep tells her. Why, she wonders, has he drilled water for the Nuer? She approaches him and thanks him for bringing the water. She tells him her name. Then, he introduces himself. His name is Salva."

Built,"The story begins with the unnamed main character, simply referred to as “the man,” on the Yukon trail. He is in the middle of a cold and isolated setting. The ground is covered in snow, and it is −75 degrees F. The man is a newcomer to the Yukon and is traveling alone except for his dog. They are heading to a camp where the man will join his companions. The man thinks happily of the lunch he carries with him and looks forward to finding his friends that night. He is not concerned about the cold, even as ice has frozen his lips together. The dog, on the other hand, senses the danger in the extreme cold. It expects the man to find shelter or build a fire. The omniscient narrator also comments on the danger in the man’s narrow perspective and lack of understanding.
The man hikes along a frozen creek, noticing areas where water has run down into the ice, making pools that could get him very wet if he fell through. The man knows that wet feet would cause trouble and delay his journey, but he does not fully consider the danger of wet feet. Nonetheless, he is cautious as he walks along the ice. At one point, he forces his dog to go ahead over some dangerous ice and it falls through. The dog climbs out, and the water immediately freezes on its legs and paws. The dog bites the ice off, and the man helps it clear its paws.
By noon, the man is pleased with his progress. He sits down and tries to eat his lunch but is shocked to discover how numb his hands have become and that his mouth has frozen over too much for him to eat. He realizes that he should build a fire. The man remembers how “a man from Sulphur Creek” had warned him about the cold but he had dismissed the danger. He slowly builds a fire and eats lunch. After he smokes a pipe, he sets off again. The dog enjoys the warm fire and is reluctant to leave it. The dog’s instinct tells it that they should not travel in the cold but should find shelter. 
The man and the dog continue up the creek until the man falls in a pool, ending up soaked to his knees. He is angry, but not frightened. He must build a fire to dry out his socks and moccasins. Slowly, he builds a fire with grass, bark, and larger and larger sticks. The narrator explains that a man must warm up quickly if his feet are wet when the temperature is this low. The man knows this as well, since he has been told so by the old man on Sulphur Creek. Additionally, he has lost all feeling in his feet and his hands are going numb. Now that he has stopped walking, his blood itself feels the cold. He feels it sinking away from his hands, feet, and skin to hide from the cold. He is surprised by how quickly his hands grow numb, and his face freezes, but the man is confident in his growing fire. He plans to warm his moccasins and feet there. He thinks back to the old man on Sulphur Creek and laughs at his warning that no one should travel alone when it is that cold. He is confident that he has saved himself.
However, disaster strikes. The man has built his fire under a tree with branches covered with snow. When he pulls sticks free, he dislodges some of the snow. In a cascading effect, snow falls from all the branches down onto his fire. It puts the fire out. The man finally begins to realize that he is in real danger. He wonders if he should have had a companion on the trip who could have built a second fire, but he must try to build another fire himself. He makes a pile of dry grass, sticks, and branches in an open space. The dog watches anxiously, depending on the man to provide a fire. The man tries to find his piece of tree bark but can’t. He realizes that his feet are freezing and beats his hands until he has feeling enough to find his bark. He is jealous of the dog’s warm fur as he struggles to light a match. But his hands are too numb to pull off a match and he drops them all in the snow. He even tries to light one with his teeth, but he coughs and drops it in the snow.
The man becomes more desperate. He burns all seventy matches at once. He tries to light the tree bark and badly burns his hands. He finally lights the bark and tries to build up the fire, using his teeth as well as his hands. But he accidentally scatters the fire, and it goes out. The man sees the dog looking at him uneasily. He decides he must kill the dog and use its warm body to defrost his hands. He calls the dog, but the dog hears a strange, frightened tone in his voice and won’t obey. He crawls toward the dog, but it backs away. The man forces himself to stand up and this reassures the dog enough that the man can grab it with his arms because his hands are too frozen. He realizes that his hands are too frozen to kill the dog anyway. Even beating his hands for five minutes does not bring feeling back. 
The man knows now that his life is in danger. In terror, he runs up the creek bed with the dog following. He oscillates between hope that he can somehow run to the camp and the knowledge that he is too frozen to make it. He cannot even feel his feet as he runs. He falls and feels warm and comfortable, although he has lost feeling in his face as well. He is frightened by this and runs again but falls a second time. He is angered by the dog’s apparent warmth and yells at it, then runs again. This time he only makes it a hundred feet before he falls. At this point, the man accepts his coming death. He imagines himself as one of “the boys,” coming down the trail and finding his own body in the snow. In his mind, the man tells the old man in Sulphur Creek that he was right. He falls into a peaceful sleep as he freezes to death. The dog stays for a while, confused that he is sitting in the snow without making a fire. Eventually it realizes the man is dead and heads up the trail alone, in search of other humans who can provide food and warmth."
Jungles,"Jurgis Rudkus and Ona Lukoszaite, a young man and woman who have recently immigrated to Chicago from Lithuania, hold their wedding feast at a bar in an area of Chicago known as Packingtown. The couple and several relatives have come to Chicago in search of a better life, but Packingtown, the center of Lithuanian immigration and of Chicago’s meatpacking industry, is a hard, dangerous, and filthy place where it is difficult to find a job. After the reception, Jurgis and Ona discover that they are more than a hundred dollars in debt to the saloonkeeper. In Lithuania, custom dictates that guests at a wedding-feast leave money to cover the cost, but in America, many of the impoverished immigrants depart from the feast without leaving any money. Jurgis, who has great faith in the American Dream, vows that he will simply work harder to make more money.
Jurgis, who is young and energetic, quickly finds work, as do Marija Berczynskas, Ona’s cousin, and Jonas, the brother of Ona’s stepmother, Teta Elzbieta. The family signs an agreement to buy a house, but it turns out to be a swindle; the agreement is full of hidden costs, and the house is shoddy and poorly maintained. As the family’s living expenses increase, even Ona and young Stanislovas, one of Teta Elzbieta’s children, are forced to look for jobs. Jobs in Packingtown involve back-breaking labor, however, conducted in unsafe conditions with little regard for individual workers. Furthermore, the immigrant community is fraught with crime and corruption. Jurgis’s father, Dede Antanas, finds a job only after agreeing to pay another man a third of his wages for helping him obtain the job. But the job is too difficult for the old man, and it quickly kills him.
Winter is the most dangerous season in Packingtown and even Jurgis, forced to work in an unheated slaughterhouse in which it is difficult to see, risks his life every day by simply going to work. Marija is courted by Tamoszius, a likable violinist, but the couple is never able to marry because they never have enough money to hold a wedding. Marija’s factory closes down and she loses her job. Distressed about the terrible conditions of his family members’ lives, Jurgis joins a union and slowly begins to understand the web of political corruption and bribery that makes Packingtown run. Hoping to improve his lot, Jurgis begins trying to learn English. Marija regains her job, but she is fired when she complains about being cheated out of some of her pay. Ona is now pregnant, and her job has become increasingly difficult for her. Her supervisor, Miss Henderson, oversees a prostitution ring, and most of the other girls at the factory are made to be prostitutes. Ona gives birth to a healthy boy, whom she and Jurgis name Antanas after Jurgis’s late father, but she is forced to return to work only seven days later.
In Packingtown, any mishap can bring ruin upon a family. Jurgis sprains his ankle and is forced to spend nearly three months in bed, unable to work. Even though poor working conditions caused the accident, the factory simply cuts off Jurgis’s pay while he recuperates. Unable to tolerate the misery, Jonas abandons the family, disappearing without a word. Kristoforas, the youngest son of Teta Elzbieta, dies of food poisoning. Jurgis at last recovers and returns to work, but the factory refuses to give him his job back. After a long, frustrating search for employment, Jurgis is forced to take a job at the fertilizer plant, the foulest place in all of Packingtown. He begins to numb himself with alcohol.
Ona is pregnant again. One night, she doesn’t return home from work, and Jurgis discovers that Phil Connor, her boss, kept her after work and forced her to sleep with him. Jurgis attacks Connor and is arrested. After an unfair trial, Jurgis is sentenced to a month in prison; the family will again be forced to scrape by without his wages. In prison, Jurgis befriends a criminal named Jack Duane. When he is released, Jurgis discovers that his family has been evicted from its home and is living at the run-down boardinghouse in which they first stayed when they arrived in Chicago. When he enters the boardinghouse, he finds Ona screaming; she is prematurely in labor, and the effort of giving birth kills her and the child. In agony, Jurgis disappears on a drinking binge.
At last, Teta Elzbieta convinces Jurgis to think of his son, and he again begins searching for a job. Through the philanthropy of a wealthy woman who takes an interest in the family, Jurgis finds a good job at a steel mill. He dedicates himself to Antanas and feels renewed hope in life. But his hopes are shattered when Antanas drowns in the mud-logged street. In despair, Jurgis abandons his surviving family members and wanders the countryside as a tramp.
In the winter, Jurgis returns to Chicago, where he finds a job digging freight tunnels. After injuring himself at work, he is forced to spend some time in the hospital. When he is released, he has no money and cannot find work, so he becomes a beggar. One night, a wealthy young man named Freddie Jones gives him a one-hundred-dollar bill, but when Jurgis asks a bartender to change it for him, the man cheats him, giving him ninety-five cents back. Jurgis attacks the man and is again sent to jail. In prison, he meets Jack Duane again. When the two men are released, Jurgis becomes Duane’s partner, and the two commit burglaries and muggings. Jurgis is eventually recruited to work for the corrupt political boss, Mike Scully. When a series of strikes hits Packingtown, Jurgis crosses the picket lines, undermining the efforts of the union but making a great deal of money as a scab.
One day, Jurgis sees Phil Connor again and attacks him. He is again sent to prison and, because Connor is a crony of Mike Scully, Jurgis’s meager political connections do not help him. After being released, he is forced to live on charity. By this time, Jurgis has completely lost touch with his family. One day, however, he meets an old acquaintance who tells him how to find Marija. He learns that Marija has become a prostitute to help support Teta Elzbieta and the children. She is also addicted to morphine. Jurgis wants to see Teta Elzbieta again but not until he finds a good job.
One night, his spirit all but crushed by privation and misery, Jurgis wanders into a socialist political rally, in which an orator delivers a speech that fills Jurgis with inspiration. Jurgis joins the socialist party and embraces its ideal that the workers—not a few wealthy capitalists—should own factories and plants. Jurgis finds a job as a porter at a socialist-run hotel and is reunited with Teta Elzbieta. He attends a socialist rally in which the speaker sums up Jurgis’s new beliefs: if more people convert to socialism, the speaker declares, then “Chicago will be ours!”"
Runs,"A Raisin in the Sun portrays a few weeks in the life of the Youngers, a Black family living on the South Side of Chicago in the 1950s. When the play opens, the Youngers are about to receive an insurance check for $10,000. This money comes from the deceased Mr. Younger’s life insurance policy. Each of the adult members of the family has an idea as to what he or she would like to do with this money. The matriarch of the family, Mama, wants to buy a house to fulfill a dream she shared with her husband. Mama’s son, Walter Lee, would rather use the money to invest in a liquor store with his friends. He believes that the investment will solve the family’s financial problems forever. Walter’s wife, Ruth, agrees with Mama, however, and hopes that she and Walter can provide more space and opportunity for their son, Travis. Finally, Beneatha, Walter’s sister and Mama’s daughter, wants to use the money for her medical school tuition. She also wishes that her family members were not so interested in assimilating into the white world. Beneatha instead tries to find her identity by looking back to the past and to Africa.
As the play progresses, the Youngers clash over their competing dreams. Ruth discovers that she is pregnant but fears that if she has the child, she will put more financial pressure on her family members. When Walter says nothing to Ruth’s admission that she is considering abortion, Mama puts a down payment on a house for the whole family. She believes that a bigger, brighter dwelling will help them all. This house is in Clybourne Park, an entirely white neighborhood. When the Youngers’ future neighbors find out that the Youngers are moving in, they send Mr. Lindner, from the Clybourne Park Improvement Association, to offer the Youngers money in return for staying away. The Youngers refuse the deal, even after Walter loses the rest of the money ($6,500) to his friend Willy Harris, who persuades Walter to invest in the liquor store and then runs off with his cash.
In the meantime, Beneatha rejects her suitor, George Murchison, whom she believes to be shallow and blind to the problems of race. Subsequently, she receives a marriage proposal from her Nigerian boyfriend, Joseph Asagai, who wants Beneatha to get a medical degree and move to Africa with him (Beneatha does not make her choice before the end of the play). The Youngers eventually move out of the apartment, fulfilling the family’s long-held dream. Their future seems uncertain and slightly dangerous, but they are optimistic and determined to live a better life. They believe that they can succeed if they stick together as a family and resolve to defer their dreams no longer."
Energy,"Walden opens with a simple announcement that Thoreau spent two years in Walden Pond, near Concord, Massachusetts, living a simple life supported by no one. He says that he now resides among the civilized again; the episode was clearly both experimental and temporary. The first chapter, “Economy,” is a manifesto of social thought and meditations on domestic management, and in it Thoreau sketches out his ideals as he describes his pond project. He devotes attention to the skepticism and wonderment with which townspeople had greeted news of his project, and he defends himself from their views that society is the only place to live. He recounts the circumstances of his move to Walden Pond, along with a detailed account of the steps he took to construct his rustic habitation and the methods by which he supported himself in the course of his wilderness experiment. It is a chapter full of facts, figures, and practical advice, but also offers big ideas about the claims of individualism versus social existence, all interspersed with evidence of scholarship and a propensity for humor.
Thoreau tells us that he completed his cabin in the spring of 1845 and moved in on July 4 of that year. Most of the materials and tools he used to build his home he borrowed or scrounged from previous sites. The land he squats on belongs to his friend Ralph Waldo Emerson; he details a cost-analysis of the entire construction project. In order to make a little money, Thoreau cultivates a modest bean-field, a job that tends to occupy his mornings. He reserves his afternoons and evenings for contemplation, reading, and walking about the countryside. Endorsing the values of austerity, simplicity, and solitude, Thoreau consistently emphasizes the minimalism of his lifestyle and the contentment to be derived from it. He repeatedly contrasts his own freedom with the imprisonment of others who devote their lives to material prosperity.
Despite his isolation, Thoreau feels the presence of society surrounding him. The Fitchburg Railroad rushes past Walden Pond, interrupting his reveries and forcing him to contemplate the power of technology. Thoreau also finds occasion to converse with a wide range of other people, such as the occasional peasant farmer, railroad worker, or the odd visitor to Walden. He describes in some detail his association with a Canadian-born woodcutter, Alex Therien, who is grand and sincere in his character, though modest in intellectual attainments. Thoreau makes frequent trips into Concord to seek the society of his longtime friends and to conduct what scattered business the season demands. On one such trip, Thoreau spends a night in jail for refusing to pay a poll tax because, he says, the government supports slavery. Released the next day, Thoreau returns to Walden.
Thoreau devotes great attention to nature, the passing of the seasons, and the creatures with which he shares the woods. He recounts the habits of a panoply of animals, from woodchucks to partridges. Some he endows with a larger meaning, often spiritual or psychological. The hooting loon that plays hide and seek with Thoreau, for instance, becomes a symbol of the playfulness of nature and its divine laughter at human endeavors. Another example of animal symbolism is the full-fledged ant war that Thoreau stumbles upon, prompting him to meditate on human warfare. Thoreau’s interest in animals is not exactly like the naturalist’s or zoologist’s. He does not observe and describe them neutrally and scientifically, but gives them a moral and philosophical significance, as if each has a distinctive lesson to teach him.
As autumn turns to winter, Thoreau begins preparations for the arrival of the cold. He listens to the squirrel, the rabbit, and the fox as they scuttle about gathering food. He watches the migrating birds, and welcomes the pests that infest his cabin as they escape the coming frosts. He prepares his walls with plaster to shut out the wind. By day he makes a study of the snow and ice, giving special attention to the mystic blue ice of Walden Pond, and by night he sits and listens to the wind as it whips and whistles outside his door. Thoreau occasionally sees ice-fishermen come to cut out huge blocks that are shipped off to cities, and contemplates how most of the ice will melt and flow back to Walden Pond. Occasionally Thoreau receives a visit from a friend like William Ellery Channing or Amos Bronson Alcott, but for the most part he is alone. In one chapter, he conjures up visions of earlier residents of Walden Pond long dead and largely forgotten, including poor tradesmen and former slaves. Thoreau prefers to see himself in their company, rather than amid the cultivated and wealthy classes.
As he becomes acquainted with Walden Pond and neighboring ponds, Thoreau wants to map their layout and measure their depths. Thoreau finds that Walden Pond is no more than a hundred feet deep, thereby refuting common folk wisdom that it is bottomless. He meditates on the pond as a symbol of infinity that people need in their lives. Eventually winter gives way to spring, and with a huge crash and roar the ice of Walden Pond begins to melt and hit the shore. In lyric imagery echoing the onset of Judgment Day, Thoreau describes the coming of spring as a vast transformation of the face of the world, a time when all sins are forgiven.
Thoreau announces that his project at the pond is over, and that he returned to civilized life on September 6, 1847. The revitalization of the landscape suggests the restoration of the full powers of the human soul, and Thoreau’s narrative observations give way, in the last chapter of Walden, to a more direct sermonizing about the untapped potential within humanity. In visionary language, Thoreau exhorts us to “meet” our lives and live fully."
Spot,"In “moon,” the first of the four parts of feed, an American teenager named Titus travels to the lunar surface with his high-school friends for spring break, hoping to escape the boredom they feel on Earth. No specific date is revealed, though it’s sometime in a dystopic future, where the moon is fully commercialized and people suffer from red sores called lesions. As Titus and his fellow upper-class friends Link, Marty, Calista, Loga, and Quendy arrive on the moon, readers also get their first glimpse of “the feed.” Although Titus doesn’t initially reveal exact details about the feed or how it works, he says it sends the friends ads and images for where to stay and shop. 
After failing to get into college-age parties, the group visits the Ricochet Lounge, where Titus becomes infatuated with a girl named Violet. She is beautiful and, he soon finds, visiting the moon by herself and is very unlike his friends: She doesn’t make pointless purchases at a mall they all soon visit and isn’t interested in malfunctioning, or falling into a drug-like stupor, via their connections to the feed. Later, when they all visit a dance club called the Rumble Spot, an old man from a dissenter group called the Coalition of Pity hacks into people’s individual feeds, causing them to broadcast the signal, “we enter a time of calamity” over the feed’s network. Police beat the man and “shut off” those hacked, including Titus and Violet, who hold hands as they collapse.
Part 2, “eden,” occurs in a lunar hospital where Violet, Titus, and his friends remain disconnected from the feed until their systems can be scanned for viruses. There, Titus provides additional details about what the feed is and how it works. Feeds are implanted inside the body and connect to a global network that provides news, entertainment, and a means to purchase every kind of product, he says while singing its praises. The feed even anticipates and creates users’ wants from individual profiles based on purchasing decisions, thoughts, and feelings. Titus and Violet grow closer during the stay. Violet, who’s home-schooled and smarter than Titus and his friends, says she hoped to enjoy herself like normal kids but now has a problem, though she remains vague about what this problem is. When doctors finally restore the friends’ feeds, they rejoice. Promotions begin to flow through their minds again, though there’s also ominous news concerning protests over America’s annexation of the moon and resulting anger from a group called the Global Alliance. Still, Titus says, the friends exalt in the return of their feeds.
In Part 3, “Utopia,” Titus and his friends return to Earth and life returns to normal for them: “upcars” travel in tubes past vertically stacked suburbs, the friends party, and U.S. President Trumbull scoffs at reports that claim toxic industries cause lesions. In defiance of rampant consumerism and a loss of individuality, Violet determines to resist the feed by creating a completely random customer profile and asks Titus to join her. Violet, who didn’t receive her feed until she was seven, voices deep concern about the decline of the world and destruction of Earth, and laments how those who’ve had the feed their entire lives are ignorant and self-centered. Titus soon has nightmares that are more likely hacks from the Coalition of Pity. In them, he sees disturbing images of eco destruction and human suffering around the world, but after Violet chats him, saying she has seen the images too, he only wants to go back to sleep.
Before long, Violet’s problem becomes clear: Her body begins to fail and she’s told by doctors that the damage to her feedware can be fatal. The prognosis makes Violet realize how much she wants to do. She starts by going to the seashore with Titus, though they need to dress in protective suits due to its toxicity. Meanwhile, feed chatter reveals that all of Earth’s forests have fallen and there is a growing rift between the U.S. and the Global Alliance. At a party where Quendy shows off her artificial lesions, Violet becomes outraged and her body falters. She chastises Titus and his friends for living in ignorance as the world dies, then collapses and is brought to the hospital. 
Violet’s condition declines further in Part 4, “slumberland,” whose chapter titles track her feed efficiency from a high of 87.3 percent to a low of 4.6 percent, 98 percent being optimal. Aware that she doesn’t have much time, Violet messages Titus a list of twenty-two things she wants to do in life, though he grows increasingly distant, and doesn’t message back. When they do reconnect, Violet sends Titus a recent memory where she falls down a staircase and receives a response from the corporation FeedTech, denying her petition to pay for her system repairs because she wasn’t deemed to be worthy due to her random customer profile. Violet later sends Titus childhood memories to preserve her history, though he deletes them. And when Violet convinces him to visit the mountains with her, one of her life goals, Titus breaks up with her, saying he was only interested in a short relationship while she wanted something eternal. 
Time passes and Titus eventually hears from Violet’s father. At Violet’s home, Titus sees her lying on a floating bed, completely pale, fully incapacitated, and covered in discs. Her father details her final, painful days and how her body failed. He then berates Titus for how badly he treated Violet and for willfully living in ignorance. Titus later visits Violet’s home a second time. Although she appears dead, her feed efficiency is at 4.6 percent and a screen shows that her heart is beating slightly. Nevertheless, Titus tells Violet a story he plans to keep telling her, he says, so she will remember herself. The story is about Violet, the end of America, and their relationship, where they learn something important about love and how to resist the feed. The book ends with a promotion on the feed for Blue-Jean Warehouse’s Final Sales Event and a recurring, fading message that “Everything must go.”"
Located,"The Bottom is a mostly Black community in Ohio, situated in the hills above the mostly white, wealthier community of Medallion. The Bottom first became a community when a master gave it to his former slave. This ""gift"" was in fact a trick: the master gave the former slave a poor stretch of hilly land, convincing the slave the land was worthwhile by claiming that because it was hilly, it was closer to heaven. The trick, though, led to the growth of a vibrant community. Now the community faces a new threat; wealthy whites have taken a liking to the land, and would like to destroy much of the town in order to build a golf course.
Shadrack, a resident of the Bottom, fought in WWI. He returns a shattered man, unable to accept the complexities of the world; he lives on the outskirts of town, attempting to create order in his life. One of his methods involves compartmentalizing his fear of death in a ritual he invents and names National Suicide Day. The town is at first wary of him and his ritual, then, over time, unthinkingly accepts him.
Meanwhile, the families of the children Nel and Sula are contrasted. Nel is the product of a family that believes deeply in social conventions; hers is a stable home, though some might characterize it as rigid. Nel is uncertain of the conventional life her mother, Helene, wants for her; these doubts are hammered home when she meets Rochelle, her grandmother and a former prostitute, the only unconventional woman in her family line. Sula's family is very different: she lives with her grandmother, Eva, and her mother, Hannah, both of whom are seen by the town as eccentric and loose. Their house also serves as a home for three informally adopted boys and a steady stream of borders.
Despite their differences, Sula and Nel become fiercely attached to each other during adolescence. However, a traumatic accident changes everything. One day, Sula playfully swings a neighborhood boy, Chicken Little, around by his hands. When she loses her grip, the boy falls into a nearby river and drowns. They never tell anyone about the accident even though they did not intend to harm the boy. The two girls begin to grow apart. One day, in an accident, Sula's mother's dress catches fire and she dies of the burns.
After high school, Nel chooses to marry and settles into the conventional role of wife and mother. Sula follows a wildly divergent path and lives a life of fierce independence and total disregard for social conventions. Shortly after Nel's wedding, Sula leaves the Bottom for a period of 10 years. She has many affairs, some with white men. However, she finds people following the same boring routines elsewhere, so she returns to the Bottom and to Nel.
Upon her return, the town regards Sula as the very personification of evil for her blatant disregard of social conventions. Their hatred in part rests upon Sula's interracial relationships, but is crystallized when Sula has an affair with Nel's husband, Jude, who subsequently abandons Nel. Ironically, the community's labeling of Sula as evil actually improves their own lives. Her presence in the community gives them the impetus to live harmoniously with one another. Nel breaks off her friendship with Sula. Just before Sula dies in 1940, they achieve a half-hearted reconciliation. With Sula's death, the harmony that had reigned in the town quickly dissolves.
In 1965, with the Bottom facing the prospect of the white golf course, Nel visits Eva in the nursing home. Eva accuses her of sharing the guilt for Chicken Little's death. Her accusation forces Nel to confront the unfairness of her judgment against Sula. Nel admits to herself that she had blamed his death entirely on Sula and set herself up as the ""good"" half of the relationship. Nel comes to realize that in the aftermath of Chicken Little's death she had too quickly clung to social convention in an effort to define herself as ""good."" Nel goes to the cemetery and mourns at Sula's grave, calling out Sula's name in sadness.
Sula is a novel about ambiguity. It questions and examines the terms ""good"" and ""evil,"" often demonstrating that the two often resemble one another. The novel addresses the confusing mysteries of human emotions and relationships, ultimately concluding that social conventions are inadequate as a foundation for living one's life. The novel tempts the reader to apply the diametrically opposed terms of ""good and evil,"" ""right and wrong"" to the characters and their actions, and yet simultaneously shows why it is necessary to resist such temptation. While exploring the ways in which people try to make meaning of lives filled with conflicts over race, gender, and simple idiosyncratic points of views, Sula resists easy answers, demonstrating the ambiguity, beauty, and terror of life, in both its triumphs and horrors."
Police,"Starr Carter, a sixteen-year-old black girl, attends a party in her neighborhood, Garden Heights. Starr goes with Kenya, a friend with whom she shares an older half-brother, Seven. Ever since attending Williamson Prep, a primarily white school, Starr feels out of place in the Garden Heights social scene. When Kenya goes off with other friends, Starr runs into her childhood best friend, Khalil Harris, whom she hasn’t seen in a long time. Gunshots from a gang fight interrupt the party, and Khalil offers to take Starr home. While Khalil drives, he explains rapper Tupac Shakur’s idea that “Thug Life” stands for “The Hate U Give Little Infants F---- Everybody.” Soon after, a white police officer with the badge number one-fifteen pulls them over. Khalil questions the motivation for the stop, and One-Fifteen orders him out of the car and searches him. One-Fifteen commands Khalil not to move, and returns to his car. Khalil opens the door to check on Starr. One-Fifteen fatally shoots Khalil.
Starr has nightmares about the death of another childhood friend, Natasha, who died in the crossfire of a gang shooting. At school on Monday, Starr feels tense around Hailey and Chris, her white friend and boyfriend, as memories of Khalil’s death interrupt her thoughts and she realizes they don’t understand. At the urging of her uncle Carlos, a police officer, Starr goes into the police station after school with her mother, Lisa, to testify about Khalil’s shooting. Starr realizes that the officers are asking more questions about whether Khalil was a troublemaker than about the night of the shooting. She worries that justice for Khalil will not be served. At Khalil’s funeral, a lawyer and activist named April Ofrah confirms Starr’s fears when she announces that the police will not pursue legal action against One-Fifteen and invites the attendees to a rally in Khalil’s honor. Starr blames herself for the police’s inaction. King, the head of a local gang called the King Lords, also interrupts the funeral and places a gray bandana on Khalil’s casket, signifying Khalil’s membership in the King Lords. April Ofrah tells Starr to call her if she needs legal representation.
The news that the police won’t prosecute One-Fifteen leads to days of protests in Garden Heights. During this time, Maverick, Starr’s father, explains to her his interpretation of Tupac’s phrase “Thug Life.” He believes that Thug Life describes a system designed against black communities. Only by speaking out can black communities begin to break the cycle. At the Carter family’s grocery store, a teenage member of the King Lords named DeVante begs Maverick, a former King Lord, to help him leave the gang. Maverick agrees. Starr sees DeVante’s request as a chance to help someone in a similar situation as Khalil. A few days later, Maverick gets into an argument with the neighborhood barber, Mr. Lewis. Although the argument is peaceful, two police officers intervene, and when they see Maverick is Starr’s father, they push him to the ground and search him. Between this scary event and pressure from Kenya, Starr decides that she will no longer be silent.
The District Attorney calls Lisa to announce that a grand jury will hear the case against One-Fifteen and asks if Starr will testify. Starr agrees, and April Ofrah decides to represent Starr pro bono, and also find a way to get Starr a television interview. Meanwhile, DeVante tells Starr that Khalil had never been a member of the King Lords and only sold drugs for King to protect his mother, who had stolen money from King. During Starr’s television interview, she decides, against Ms. Ofrah’s advice, to talk about the truth behind Khalil’s drug dealing. Starr’s implication of King enrages him. The night before her grand jury testimony, someone throws a brick and fires a gun into the Carter household. Unsure if the culprits are the King Lords or the police, Starr almost backs out of testifying. However, she ultimately decides that Khalil needs her truth. She testifies before the grand jury.
Almost two months later, the grand jury announces their decision not to indict One-Fifteen. Starr and some of her friends get caught up in the resulting riots. As she tries to avoid the chaos, Starr stumbles upon a protest led by Ms. Ofrah. She offers Starr the megaphone, and Starr leads a chant in front of the protest. The police try to break up the protest with tear gas. Starr and her friends head to the Carter family store to get milk to help heal their eyes. A Molotov cocktail lands in the store, setting it ablaze and trapping them. Maverick arrives just in time to unlock the back door. King arrives to taunt them, proud about getting his revenge. The police arrive, and King, confident that no one will testify against him, claims ignorance. However, the neighbors rally around the Carter family and tell the police that they saw King throw the Molotov cocktail. The police arrest King. Although the grocery store is in ruins, Starr knows that the family will rebuild. She vows to continue fighting for justice on behalf of Khalil and all other black people killed at the hands of police."
Lakes,"The plot structure of In the Lake of the Woods doesn’t follow a conventional path. The story jumps back and forth in time and setting, a structure reflected in this overview. Like a complex jigsaw puzzle, bits and pieces of information are presented to readers in an order that reveals information, a little at a time, to slowly uncover events and reasons why characters, John Wade in particular, act, think, and feel the way they do. At first, this structure may seem confusing, but as the novel moves along and readers put more and more pieces together, characters and events become clearer.
In a cottage by Lake of the Woods, an area that contains a huge lake located between Canada and Minnesota, John and Kathy Wade, a married couple in their late thirties, try to heal their wounds after John’s devastating primary election loss. They are both unhappy, each for their own reasons, but they spend their evenings on the porch, pretending to buoy themselves up with talk of a better future.
One day, John and Kathy drive into town and have a short argument at the Mini-Mart. Kathy thinks John blames her for his election loss. Later that night, they go to bed, and the next day Kathy is gone.
The book includes many “hypothesis” chapters, each presenting an idea of what could have happened. The first of these chapters suggests that Kathy got into a waiting car. The book also includes several chapters titled “Evidence.” These chapters present quotes from characters, snippets from books, and various exhibits, all of which provide readers with information that may or may not explain what happened to Kathy and why. Much of the evidence presented relates to John’s time in the Vietnam War.
When John is a teenager, his father commits suicide. John loves his father so much that he pretends he isn’t dead. As a child and teen, John also performs magic tricks.
In college, when John meets Kathy, he vows to use “tricks” to make her fall in love with him. John plans to become a politician, and he enlists in the Vietnam War. John’s platoon, Charlie Company, calls him “Sorcerer” because he does tricks and brings good luck. Two years later, he returns home. He spies on Kathy and discovers her being unfaithful to him. They marry anyway.
At the cottage, the night before Kathy disappears, John imagines fighting Jesus, and he kills houseplants with boiling water. He goes into the bedroom with the teakettle. John forgets what else happens. He wakes up alone the next morning. The next hypothesis presented is that Kathy heard John say, “Kill Jesus!” and saw him kill the houseplants, so she ran away in fear.
John embraces magic as a way to escape his father, an alcoholic who teases him mercilessly. John proposes to Kathy at a college bar. He writes Kathy from Vietnam but doesn’t tell her about all the death he sees. One morning in Vietnam, John is surrounded by machine-gun fire. He shoots at things including PFC Weatherby, a fellow soldier. Then he convinces himself it never happened.
Back at home, John and Kathy get married, and John becomes a state senator. For a while, John and Kathy are spontaneous and passionate. By the time he gets elected lieutenant governor, he and Kathy have marital problems. One night, John tries to talk to Kathy about Vietnam, but she deflects the conversation. John sometimes yells out in his sleep.
When John wakes up in the cottage bedroom without Kathy, he isn’t worried. He figures she’ll show up later. He does chores, makes plans, and drinks. At midnight, John goes to the cottage owner, Claude Rasmussen, for help. They decide they will call the authorities in the morning. The next group of evidence presented shares the recollections of Kathy’s and John’s friends and family.
Helicopters from John’s platoon set down in the village of Thuan Yen. Most of the soldiers brutally shoot the villagers. John doesn’t want to be part of it, but he kills an old man and Weatherby.
The next hypothesis presented is that Kathy, scared after finding the dead houseplants, takes out the boat and drowns.
The morning after Claude and John report Kathy missing, the county sheriff, Art Lux, and local police officer, Vinny Pearson, arrive and question John. An employee at the Mini-Mart says she witnessed an argument. John spends the night drinking with Claude. He is unable to reach Kathy’s sister, Pat, but Pat sees the news of Kathy’s disappearance on TV. Evidence presented next shares testimony of the soldiers who took part in the Thuan Yen massacre. Lieutenant Calley ordered the men to shoot everything.
When John returns home from the war, he successfully runs for state Senate with Tony Carbo as his campaign manager. John and Kathy spend their money on his campaigns and put off buying a house and having children. Kathy feels shut out from John. John has been elected lieutenant governor when Kathy becomes pregnant. He convinces her to get an abortion because of the bad timing. Kathy has the abortion but is upset as all she ever wanted was a baby. Four years later, John gives a speech announcing his run for the Senate primary. Kathy thinks he didn’t talk about issues enough, but Tony thinks image and winning are most important.
The next hypothesis shows Kathy in the boat heading toward the nearby town. She gets lost and eventually stops at an island for the night. Kathy thinks about a man named Harmon with whom she had an affair.
Pat arrives at the cottage to join the search. She distrusts John. They discuss John and Kathy’s relationship. John knew about Kathy’s affair, and Pat says that Kathy hated being a politician’s wife. The next collection of evidence includes how good John was at magic and fooling people.
The massacre at Thuan Yen continues all day. John tells PFC Richard Thinbill he killed two people. Calley orders the company to search and destroy the village. Sorcerer tells Thinbill they will have to forget this day, but Thinbill wants to report what happened.
John concedes early on the night of the primary because the election is a rout. Kathy is radiantly happy that John didn’t win. The next hypothesis picks up with Kathy on the island. She is back in the boat, but she is lost.
The next day John and Pat go out on a boat to search for Kathy with Claude. John has a hard time concentrating, which angers Pat. When they get back to the beach, they encounter other searchers. Vinny, who thinks John killed Kathy, and John argue, while Pat talks with the sheriff. They all continue to go out every day for several weeks but find nothing, and most of the searchers give up. John thinks about the magical art of making oneself disappear, which his father did with his suicide. He figures out how to make himself disappear too and dives into the lake. He resurfaces and later finds out the police are going to search the cottage next. John asks Claude for a boat because he wants to go out alone, but Claude refuses. John prepares himself, and the next morning he takes the keys to Claude’s boat.
The next hypothesis suggests Kathy committed suicide.
After Thuan Yen, John enlists for another year. He tries to drive the images of the murdered people out of his head. Before he returns to the United States, he takes a desk job, and he edits files to erase himself from his platoon.
The next hypothesis suggests that John kills Kathy by pouring boiling water into her eyes. Afterward, he throws her weighted body into the lake and sinks the boat.
On Claude’s boat, John motors into Canadian waters. Over the next few days, he calls out for Kathy and drinks. He uses the radio to broadcast himself speaking about Kathy. Then he throws the radio overboard and keeps going.
Law enforcement never finds any evidence of Kathy around the cottage. The mystery of what happened to her, and John as well, is never solved. Most people think they are somewhere else together. This is one possible hypothesis, according to the narrator."
Crave,"A youth named Equality 7-2521, who has found a hidden tunnel and hides in it to write, knows his solitude violates all the laws of his society. Even though he does not feel guilt for his actions, he begs the forgiveness of the ruling Council. As he spends more time alone, he realizes that solitude suits him, and he begins to crave more and more time by himself. From his tunnel, Equality 7-2521 records episodes from his childhood. As a child, Equality 7-2521 wanted more than anything to be a scholar. He believed he was cursed with a terrific curiosity, which made him prefer some things to others and to prefer some people to others. He often fought with the boys at the Home of Students, and he was reprimanded by his teachers for being too smart and too tall. He tried to conform to the standard the others set, but no matter how hard he tried, he was smarter and quicker than they were. When the Council of Vocations assigned him to be a street sweeper instead of a scholar, he was pleased because it meant he could atone for the sins he had committed.
When he was ten, Equality 7-2521 saw the public execution of the Transgressor of the Unspeakable Word, who had discovered the word “I” and was burned to death in the town square as punishment for using the word. While he was burning, the Transgressor showed no pain but locked eyes with Equality 7-2521. Equality 7-2521 comes to believe that that moment anointed him as a disciple of the same crusade as the Transgressor.
Equality 7-2521 begins to conduct experiments and shortly discovers electricity. After many weeks of work, he successfully builds a lightbulb from the materials he finds in his tunnel. He decides that he must share his invention with the world and resolves to present it to the World Council of Scholars when it convenes that year in his city.
In the meantime, Equality 7-2521 has met the Golden One, a beautiful peasant girl who is proud and haughty. He knows it is wrong to do so, but he speaks to her when he gets the chance, and they immediately fall in love. One day, she offers him some water from her hands, and he drinks it, not understanding why this act makes him think of the Palace of Mating, where he and all other mature citizens are sent once a year to have sex.
Before he can show the lightbulb to the World Council, Equality 7-2521 accidentally returns late to the Home of the Street Sweepers, where he lives. When he refuses to tell his Home Council where he has been, he is thrown into the Palace of Corrective Detention. There he is tortured, but he still refuses to tell where he has been, because he wants to keep the lightbulb a secret until he gets to show it to the World Council. He remains incarcerated until the World Council convenes, when he breaks out of the Palace of Corrective Detention and goes to the World Council, expecting to be exonerated and reconciled with his brothers.
When Equality 7-2521 arrives and tells the World Council his story, however, the World Council rejects him out of fear and anger. It threatens to kill him and to get rid of his lightbulb. He cannot abide having his lightbulb destroyed, so he grabs his invention and flees the city. He runs to the Uncharted Forest where he discovers that he is free at last to do as he pleases.
A few days later, the Golden One appears. She has followed Equality 7-2521 into the woods. They vow to live together in peace and solitude. After they have been hiking for several days in the mountains, they find an abandoned house from the Unmentionable Times. The Golden One revels in the finery she finds in the house, and Equality 7-2521 consumes the library. He discovers the meaning of the word “I,” and he vows to protect his home and from there launch a new race of men who will believe in individualism and the never-ending supremacy of the ego."
Regulating,"The four Garcia sisters, Carla, Sandra, Yolanda and Sofia, enjoyed a fairly sheltered and luxurious childhood in the Dominican Republic. They often received exciting presents from FAO Schwarz in the United States. Carla remembers an iron bank representing Mary ascending to heaven, which she gave to one of the family's maids, who was later dismissed for stealing the bank. Yolanda played with her boy cousin and showed him her genitals in exchange for a Human Body doll and modeling clay. She also stole a newborn kitten from its mother and put it inside a drum that she played until she grew bored and threw the kitten outside, where it sadly hobbled away. The mother cat appeared to her in nightmares and haunted her. Sandra wanted to be an artist but her irrepressible spirit got her in trouble and she was thrown out of art class. She later came upon a naked chained insane sculptor who scared her as she fell and broke her arm. She lost her artistic vision and settled for being the sculptor's muse when she realized he had used her face in a representation of the Virgin Mary.
When their father, Carlos, got in trouble with the secret police for agitating against the military dictatorship, the family enlisted the help of a CIA operative, Vic, to get them out of the country. They fled to New York City, where they had trouble adjusting culturally and materially to the new situation. Laura, the sisters' mother, came from a wealthy and influential family in the Dominican Republic and did not like having to become a middle class nobody in the United States. She found comfort through supporting her daughters' endeavors, such as Yolanda's poetry and Sofia's defiance of her father's overprotective nature.
Dr. Fanning helped Carlos get a medical fellowship, and offered to take the family out for a celebratory dinner once they had settled in the United States. Laura wanted to make a good impression and pressured the girls to behave themselves and not ask for any special treats. After Sandra saw Mrs. Fanning kiss her father in the restroom, she insisted that Dr. Fanning buy her a flamenco doll. Carla had trouble fitting in to American school settings, and was harassed by abusive and prejudiced schoolboys. She also was nearly molested by a perverted exhibitionist in a car. Yolanda began to write in English and found a way to express her own voice, though she started off by imitating Walt Whitman. Her father criticized her insubordination, which Yolanda perceived to be intellectual independence. Sofia was sent to the Dominican Republic as a punishment for using marijuana, though she ended up getting into more trouble by spending time without a chaperone with her illegitimate cousin, Manuel.
In college, Yolanda had trouble relating to men, since she was turned off by the vocabulary men use to describe sex. Though she was attracted to a boy, Rudy, she would not sleep with him and he accused her of being frigid. She was hurt by this but later realized that he was just a jerk. She later married a man she thought she loved, John, though at a certain point they had problems communicating. Like Rudy, he did not understand her Dominican cultural heritage, and could not appreciate the Spanish language. When Yolanda stopped trusting and loving John, she could not understand the words he used, and only heard ""babble, babble."" She had a mental breakdown at her parents' house, in which she could only quote and misquote bits of things she had read and heard throughout her life. She spent time in a mental hospital until she recovered. Her sister Sandra also had a mental breakdown, in which she thought she was regressing through evolution, and would eventually cease to be human.
After Sandra is released from the hospital, Sofia planned to reconcile with her father during a birthday party. She broke tradition, in that the daughters would usually come home for their father's birthday, but she hosts the party at her house to show off her German husband and two blond children. She and her father had fought when he accused her of sleeping around during a trip to Colombia, where she met her husband, Otto. She ran away from home to assert her independence, and later married Otto. Though the party was going well, Sofia was hurt that her father did not express more affection toward her. She humiliated him with a seductive kiss in the ear as part of a party game. Yolanda returned to the Dominican Republic, possibly for good, to embrace her extended family and cultural roots. Her family thought she was crazy for driving into the countryside by herself, but she ignored them. She got lost looking for fresh guavas, and then got a flat tire. When approached by two men, she panicked and pretended not to speak any Spanish. Yolanda felt more comfortable in her English speaking American identity than with the Dominican side of her personality."
Folks,"In this book, originally published in 1903, W. E. B. Du Bois has collected fourteen of his own essays about life after the Civil War, especially in the South. While the book predominantly deals with Black society and the life of “freedmen,” it also discusses how white society evolved after Emancipation. Throughout the text, Du Bois presents specific examples of racial injustice and inequality in the South. Before each essay, Du Bois includes a poem (or an excerpt from a poem or song) appropriate to the essay’s subject matter. Every inclusion is “a bar of the Sorrow Songs,—some echo of haunting melody from the only American music which welled up from the black souls in the dark past.” Du Bois revisits the significance of these inclusions at the end of the book.
While each essay examines a particular piece of the evolution of Black society, they are arranged to give the reader a historical perspective. Chapter I and Chapter II deal with the history and immediate impact of Emancipation, using historical examples and Du Bois’s own experience. Chapter III. specifically discusses the formation and responsibility of Black leadership, while criticizing Booker T. Washington on an academic level. Du Bois goes on to describe the Atlanta Compromise and the limitations it has placed on Black society in the South. Chapter IV through Chapter VII discuss the need for progress, and how it is blocked by lack of education and opportunity. He stresses that current systems produce mostly laborers, and that there is little room for Black upward mobility, especially in the South, due to a lack of education (and college-educated individuals). In Chapter VIII and Chapter IX, Du Bois describes visiting Dougherty County in rural Georgia. His first-hand experiences there are contrasted with his upbringing in New England, to show not only that there is greater disparity in the South, but also that many Black people in the South are not fully aware of it. In Chapter VI and Chapter VII, Du Bois draws on analogies to mythology to better explain the challenges he sees in the upbringing of Black men. In Chapter X., Du Bois examines the religion of the Black South. 
Chapters XI, XII, and XIII offer narrative examples of individuals Du Bois has encountered and events from Du Bois’s own life to illustrate the disparity between white and Black society. He discusses the death of his young son, pays tribute to a world-traveling preacher who remained undiscouraged, and recalls a student who had great potential but was a victim of his circumstances. Du Bois admits that these men are not well-known to history, but he considers their experiences are worthy of study. The final chapter, Chapter XIV, has several selections of “Sorrow Songs” that Du Bois describes as the “spiritual heritage of the nation.” He describes how the songs have been handed down, many from before slavery, and how they have become interconnected with religion and are still a centerpiece in Black society. 
Throughout the work, Du Bois uses historical fact and narrative example to establish how slavery and its aftereffects have shaped both Black and white society in the South. As a teacher, he then examines each situation academically. He presents cause and effect relationships and applies sociological analysis to them. The largest problem Du Bois discusses is the shortage of resources and opportunity for Black people at the beginning of the 20th century. He points out the effects of disparities in education and privilege and demonstrates the need for change."
Seize,"Tommy Wilhelm is a man in his mid-forties, temporarily living in the Hotel Gloriana on the Upper West Side of New York City, the same hotel in which his father has taken residence for a number of years. He is out of place from the beginning, living in a hotel filled with elderly retirees and continuing throughout the novel to be a figure of isolation amidst crowds. The novella traverses one very important day in the life of this self-same Tommy Wilhelm: his ""day of reckoning,"" so to speak.
As the novella opens, Tommy is descending in the hotel elevator, on his way to meet his father for breakfast, as he does every morning. However, this morning feels different to Tommy, he feels a certain degree of fear and of foreboding for something that lies in the hours ahead of him and has been building for quite some time.
The reader begins to discover through Tommy's thoughts and through a series of flashbacks that Tommy has just recently been fired from his job as a salesman, he is a college drop-out, a man with two children, recently separated from his wife, and he is a man on the brink of financial disaster. Tommy has just given over the last of his savings to the fraudulent Dr. Tamkin, who has promised to knowingly invest it in the commodities market. Amid all of this, he has, apparently, fallen in love with a woman named Olive, who he cannot marry because his wife will not grant him a divorce. Tommy is unhappy and in need of assistance both emotionally and financially.
In the first three chapters the reader follows Tommy as he talks with his father, Dr. Adler, who sees his son as a failure in every sense of the word. Tommy is refused financial assistance and also refused any kind of support, emotionally or otherwise, from his father. It is also within these beginning chapters that the flashbacks begin. The flashbacks highlight, among other things, Tommy's meeting with the duplicitous Maurice Venice, the talent scout who shows initial interest in a young Tommy and his good looks. Wilhelm, however, is later rejected by the same scout after a failed screen test but nevertheless attempts a career in Hollywood as an actor. He discontinues his college education and moves to California, against his parent's will and warnings.
The chapters that follow focus on Tommy's encounters and conversations with Dr. Tamkin, a seemingly fraudulent and questionable ""psychologist,"" who gives Tommy endless advice and thus provides the assistance he had looked for from his father. Whether Tamkin is fraudulent and questionable as a psychologist, and whether he is a liar and a charlatan is a question that is constantly being posed to us. Regardless, Tamkin is quite charming and appeals to Tommy. Dr. Tamkin claims to be a poet, a healer, a member of the Detroit Purple Gang, as well as claiming a number of other positions and titles. Despite his lies, he gives Tommy kernels of truth that become significant in the novella and for Tommy. Moreover, Tommy entrusts Tamkin with the last of his savings to invest in the commodities market, since Tamkin claims a certain stock market expertise.
The rest of the novella consists of Tommy and Dr. Tamkin traveling back and forth to and from the stock market, meeting several characters along the way. The novel finally illustrates Tommy's terrible loss in the commodities in which Tamkin has invested Tommy's money. Tommy has lost all of his savings but still has the monetary demands of his family to meet. Furthermore, Tamkin has disappeared. After an attempt to look for Tamkin in his room at the hotel, the novella comes to a close with three climaxes—two minor and one large, final climax.
First, there is the final confrontation with his father in the massage room of the hotel in which Tommy is denied any assistance one last time, as he stands before his naked father. Afterward, Tommy has a loud and almost raving fight with his wife on the telephone in which he claims to be ""suffocating"" and unable to ""breathe."" Full of rage, he exits out onto Broadway where he believes to see Dr. Tamkin at a funeral, nearby. He calls out to Tamkin but receives no reply. Suddenly he is swept in by a rush of people and finds himself carried into a crowd within the chapel where the funeral is taking place. It is here that the final climax comes because Tommy finds himself before the body of a dead stranger, unable to break away and he begins to cry and weep. He releases pools of emotion and ""crie[s] with all his heart."" It is here that the book ends. Other people at the funeral are confused as to who he is, wondering how close he had been to the deceased. The deceased is a stranger but Tommy, however, is left in this ""happy oblivion of tears."""
Mariners,"Silas Marner is the weaver in the English countryside village of Raveloe in the early nineteenth century. Like many weavers of his time, he is an outsider—the object of suspicion because of his special skills and the fact that he has come to Raveloe from elsewhere. The villagers see Silas as especially odd because of the curious cataleptic fits he occasionally suffers. Silas has ended up in Raveloe because the members of his religious sect in Lantern Yard, an insular neighborhood in a larger town, falsely accused him of theft and excommunicated him.
	Much shaken after the accusation, Silas finds nothing familiar in Raveloe to reawaken his faith and falls into a numbing routine of solitary work. His one attempt at neighborliness backfires: when an herbal remedy he suggests for a neighbor’s illness works, he is rumored to be a sort of witch doctor. With little else to live for, Silas becomes infatuated with the money he earns for his work and hoards it, living off as little as possible. Every night he pulls his gold out from its hiding place beneath his floorboards to count it. He carries on in this way for fifteen years.
	Squire Cass is the wealthiest man in Raveloe, and his two eldest sons are Godfrey and Dunstan, or Dunsey. Dunsey is greedy and cruel, and enjoys tormenting Godfrey, the eldest son. Godfrey is good-natured but weak-willed, and, though secretly married to the opium addict Molly Farren, he is in love with Nancy Lammeter. Dunsey talked Godfrey into the marriage and repeatedly blackmails him with threats to reveal the marriage to their father. Godfrey gives Dunsey 100 pounds of the rent money paid to him by one of their father’s tenants. Godfrey then finds himself in a bind when Dunsey insists that Godfrey repay the sum himself. Dunsey once again threatens to reveal Godfrey’s marriage but, after some arguing, offers to sell Godfrey’s prize horse, Wildfire, to repay the loan.
	The next day, Dunsey meets with some friends who are hunting and negotiates the sale of the horse. Dunsey decides to participate in the hunt before finalizing the sale, and, in doing so, he has a riding accident that kills the horse. Knowing the rumors of Silas’s hoard, Dunsey makes plans to intimidate the weaver into lending him money. His walk home takes him by Silas’s cottage, and, finding the cottage empty, Dunsey steals the money instead.
	Silas returns from an errand to find his money gone. Overwhelmed by the loss, he runs to the local tavern for help and announces the theft to a sympathetic audience of tavern regulars. The theft becomes the talk of the village, and a theory arises that the thief might have been a peddler who came through the village some time before. Godfrey, meanwhile, is distracted by thoughts of Dunsey, who has not returned home. After hearing that Wildfire has been found dead, Godfrey decides to tell his father about the money, though not about his marriage. The Squire flies into a rage at the news, but does not do anything drastic to punish Godfrey.
	Silas is utterly disconsolate at the loss of his gold and numbly continues his weaving. Some of the townspeople stop by to offer their condolences and advice. Among these visitors, Dolly Winthrop stands out. Like many of the others, she encourages Silas to go to church—something he has not done since he was banished from Lantern Yard—but she is also gentler and more genuinely sympathetic.
	Nancy Lammeter arrives at Squire Cass’s famed New Year’s dance resolved to reject Godfrey’s advances because of his unsound character. However, Godfrey is more direct and insistent than he has been in a long time, and Nancy finds herself exhilarated by the evening in spite of her resolution. Meanwhile, Molly, Godfrey’s secret wife, is making her way to the Casses’ house to reveal the secret marriage. She has their daughter, a toddler, in her arms. Tiring after her long walk, Molly takes a draft of opium and passes out by the road. Seeing Silas’s cottage and drawn by the light of the fire, Molly’s little girl wanders through the open door and falls asleep at Silas’s hearth.
	Silas is having one of his fits at the time and does not notice the little girl enter his cottage. When he comes to, he sees her already asleep on his hearth, and is as stunned by her appearance as he was by the disappearance of his money. A while later, Silas traces the girl’s footsteps outside and finds Molly’s body lying in the snow. Silas goes to the Squire’s house to find the doctor, and causes a stir at the dance when he arrives with the baby girl in his arms. Godfrey, recognizing his daughter, accompanies the doctor to Silas’s cottage. When the doctor declares that Molly is dead, Godfrey realizes that his secret is safe. He does not claim his daughter, and Silas adopts her.
	Silas grows increasingly attached to the child and names her Eppie, after his mother and sister. With Dolly Winthrop’s help, Silas raises the child lovingly. Eppie begins to serve as a bridge between Silas and the rest of the villagers, who offer him help and advice and have come to think of him as an exemplary person because of what he has done. Eppie also brings Silas out of the benumbed state he fell into after the loss of his gold. In his newfound happiness, Silas begins to explore the memories of his past that he has long repressed.
	The novel jumps ahead sixteen years. Godfrey has married Nancy and Squire Cass has died. Godfrey has inherited his father’s house, but he and Nancy have no children. Their one daughter died at birth, and Nancy has refused to adopt. Eppie has grown into a pretty and spirited young woman, and Silas a contented father. The stone-pit behind Silas’s cottage is drained to water neighboring fields, and Dunsey’s skeleton is found at the bottom, along with Silas’s gold. The discovery frightens Godfrey, who becomes convinced that his own secrets are destined to be uncovered as well. He confesses the truth to Nancy about his marriage to Molly and fathering of Eppie. Nancy is not angry but regretful, saying that they could have adopted Eppie legitimately if Godfrey had told her earlier.
	That evening, Godfrey and Nancy decide to visit Silas’s cottage to confess the truth of Eppie’s lineage and claim her as their daughter. However, after hearing Godfrey and Nancy’s story, Eppie tells them she would rather stay with Silas than live with her biological father. Godfrey and Nancy leave, resigning themselves to helping Eppie from afar. The next day Silas decides to visit Lantern Yard to see if he was ever cleared of the theft of which he was accused years before. The town has changed almost beyond recognition, though, and Silas’s old chapel has been torn down to make way for a new factory. Silas realizes that his questions will never be answered, but he is content with the sense of faith he has regained through his life with Eppie. That summer Eppie is married to Aaron Winthrop, Dolly’s son. Aaron comes to live in Silas’s cottage, which has been expanded and refurbished at Godfrey’s expense."
Deprivation,"Anne’s diary begins on her thirteenth birthday, June 12, 1942, and ends shortly after her fifteenth. At the start of her diary, Anne describes fairly typical girlhood experiences, writing about her friendships with other girls, her crushes on boys, and her academic performance at school. Because anti-Semitic laws forced Jews into separate schools, Anne and her older sister, Margot, attended the Jewish Lyceum in Amsterdam.
	The Franks had moved to the Netherlands in the years leading up to World War II to escape persecution in Germany. After the Germans invaded the Netherlands in 1940, the Franks were forced into hiding. With another family, the van Daans, and an acquaintance, Mr. Dussel, they moved into a small secret annex above Otto Frank’s office where they had stockpiled food and supplies. The employees from Otto’s firm helped hide the Franks and kept them supplied with food, medicine, and information about the outside world.
	The residents of the annex pay close attention to every development of the war by listening to the radio. Some bits of news catch Anne’s attention and make their way into her diary, providing a vivid historical context for her personal thoughts. The adults make optimistic bets about when the war will end, and their mood is severely affected by Allied setbacks or German advances. Amsterdam is devastated by the war during the two years the Franks are in hiding. All of the city’s residents suffer, since food becomes scarce and robberies more frequent.
	Anne often writes about her feelings of isolation and loneliness. She has a tumultuous relationship with the adults in the annex, particularly her mother, whom she considers lacking in love and affection. She adores her father, but she is frequently scolded and criticized by Mr. and Mrs. van Daan and Mr. Dussel. Anne thinks that her sister, Margot, is smart, pretty, and agreeable, but she does not feel close to her and does not write much about her. Anne eventually develops a close friendship with Peter van Daan, the teenage boy in the annex. Mr. Frank does not approve, however, and the intensity of Anne’s infatuation begins to lessen.
	Anne matures considerably throughout the course of her diary entries, moving from detailed accounts of basic activities to deeper, more profound thoughts about humanity and her own personal nature. She finds it difficult to understand why the Jews are being singled out and persecuted. Anne also confronts her own identity. Though she considers herself to be German, her German citizenship has been revoked, and though she calls Holland her home, many of the Dutch have turned against the Jews. Anne feels a tremendous solidarity with her aggrieved people, and yet at the same time she wants to be seen as an individual rather than a member of a persecuted group.
During the two years recorded in her diary, Anne deals with confinement and deprivation, as well as the complicated and difficult issues of growing up in the brutal circumstances of the Holocaust. Her diary describes a struggle to define herself within this climate of oppression. Anne’s diary ends without comment on August 1, 1944, the end of a seemingly normal day that leaves us with the expectation of seeing another entry on the next page. However, the Frank family is betrayed to the Nazis and arrested on August 4, 1944. Anne’s diary, the observations of an imaginative, friendly, sometimes petty, and rather normal teenage girl, comes to an abrupt and silent end. 
Otto Frank is the family’s sole survivor, and he recovers Anne’s diary from Miep. He decides to fulfill Anne’s wishes by publishing the diary. Anne’s diary becomes a condemnation of the unimaginable horror of the Holocaust, and one of the few accounts that describe it from a young person’s perspective.
	Since Anne’s diary is a true personal account of a life in hiding, it is inappropriate to analyze it as a novel or other work of fiction. Parts of the diary were intended for public view, but others clearly were not. To appreciate and interpret the diary, it is necessary to consider its horrible context, World War II and the Holocaust, before any discussion of plot development or thematic content."
Prolonged,"Never Let Me Go takes place in a dystopian version of late 1990s England, where the lives of ordinary citizens are prolonged through a state-sanctioned program of human cloning. The clones, referred to as students, grow up in special institutions away from the outside world. As young adults, they begin to donate their vital organs. All “donors” receive care from designated “carers,” clones who have not yet begun the donation process. The clones continue to donate organs until they “complete,” which is a euphemism for death after the donation of three or four organs. However, this premise is not immediately apparent to the reader. At the start of the novel, narrator Kathy H. merely introduces herself as a thirty-one-year-old carer. She has been a carer for nearly twelve years, but will leave her role in a few months. Kathy explains that she wants to revisit her memories of Tommy and Ruth, two friends who grew up with her at the Hailsham school. Kathy does not explain the donation program, or mention that Hailsham students are clones.
Although Kathy’s narration is often nonlinear, the novel’s three parts roughly align with three stages in her life. In Part One, Kathy remembers her childhood at Hailsham. She describes her friendship with Ruth, whose temperamental personality contrasts with her own quiet demeanor. At Hailsham, Ruth often annoys Kathy by pretending to have special knowledge and privileges. Kathy also describes Tommy, a student known for throwing violent temper tantrums. Tommy is initially an outcast among his peers because he lacks artistic ability, which the Hailsham staff (part teacher, part parent figures known as “guardians”), and its students value highly. Kathy sympathizes with Tommy, and tries to calm him down during one of his tantrums. Tommy later learns to control his temper after a guardian named Miss Lucy assures him that it is not necessary for him to be creative.
Although the students learn vaguely about the donation program, their guardians shield them from a full understanding of their future. Miss Lucy disagrees with this indirect approach, and often exhibits strange behavior in front of the students as a result, in one instance telling them explicitly about their futures. After Miss Lucy speaks with Tommy about his artwork, he and Kathy theorize that creativity may be connected to donations. They speculate about Madame, a woman who visits Hailsham to collect the best student artwork. Madame is rumored to keep this art in a personal gallery. Kathy later encounters Madame in the girls’ dormitory, while Kathy dances to the song “Never Let Me Go.” The song is Kathy’s favorite track on Songs After Dark, a Judy Bridgewater album that is one of her most prized possessions. When the song ends, Kathy sees Madame crying in the doorway. Shortly afterwards, Kathy loses her tape. Tommy’s temper returns during their last summer at Hailsham. Kathy thinks he is upset about his recent breakup with Ruth, whom he has dated for six months. But Tommy is upset about Miss Lucy, who recently told him that she was wrong to dismiss the importance of creativity. Miss Lucy departs Hailsham abruptly, and Tommy mends his relationship with Ruth.
In Part Two, Kathy moves with Ruth and Tommy to a transitional housing facility known as the Cottages. They adjust to their new lives, becoming acquainted with the “veteran” students living there already. Ruth often ignores Tommy and Kathy in her efforts to blend in with the veterans, who are not from Hailsham. Kathy notices that the veterans regard the Hailsham students with awe. One couple, Chrissie and Rodney, are especially interested in Hailsham. They convince Ruth to go with them to Norfolk, where Rodney claims to have seen Ruth’s “possible” in an open-plan office (a “possible” is a human that resembles a specific clone and from whom that clone's DNA may have been copied). Kathy is skeptical of Rodney’s story, especially since it features Ruth’s “dream future” of working in an open-plan office. In the end, Kathy, Tommy, Ruth, Rodney, and Chrissie all drive to Norfolk.
In Norfolk, Chrissie and Rodney ask about a rumored exception allowing Hailsham couples in love to defer their donations. Ruth pretends to know something about deferrals, which surprises Kathy and Tommy. The students eventually find the open-plan office. Rodney points to a woman in the window, and they all agree that she could be Ruth’s legitimate possible. They follow her to an art gallery, where they realize that the woman does not actually resemble Ruth. In her disappointment, Ruth says that the students are modeled only on “trash.” Ruth goes off with Chrissie and Rodney. Meanwhile, Tommy and Kathy find a copy of Kathy’s lost tape in a secondhand store. Tommy tells Kathy that he has begun drawing pictures of imaginary animals. He thinks Madame uses the students’ artwork to determine if couples applying for deferrals are truly in love. After Norfolk, Ruth stops talking about her dream future. Tommy shows his drawings to Kathy, who finds them puzzling but captivating. Meanwhile, Kathy’s friendship with Ruth grows increasingly tense. Ruth reveals that she knows Kathy likes Tommy, but says that Tommy will never return Kathy’s feelings. Shortly afterwards, Kathy submits her application for carer training and departs.
Part Three focuses on Kathy’s time as carer. While Kathy is good at her job, the work is both difficult and lonely. She unexpectedly runs into a Hailsham friend named Laura, who is also a carer. They talk about Ruth, who had a bad first donation. They also talk about Hailsham, which has closed. Kathy becomes Ruth’s carer, but their relationship is strained and guarded. One day, Ruth expresses a desire to visit a beached fishing boat near Tommy’s recovery center. They pick up Tommy on the way to the boat, which they find bleached and crumbling in a marsh. The marsh reminds both Tommy and Ruth of Hailsham. They also discuss Chrissie, who completed on her second donation. On the return trip, Ruth apologizes for keeping Tommy and Kathy apart. She encourages them to pursue a deferral, revealing that she has discovered Madame’s home address. In the weeks that follow, Kathy and Ruth reminisce peacefully about Hailsham and the Cottages. Ruth also encourages Kathy to become Tommy’s carer.
Ruth completes after her second donation. Tommy gives his third donation, and Kathy becomes his carer. They spend their days reading and talking at his recovery center. Eventually, they also begin to have sex. Hoping to pursue a deferral, they go to visit Madame at the address Ruth provided. Madame invites them inside and listens to their request, after which Miss Emily appears from the next room. Miss Emily says that deferrals do not exist. She explains that Hailsham was part of a progressive movement committed to raising clones more humanely. Madame used to exhibit the students’ artwork to show the outside world that clones had souls. Although the movement once had many supporters, changing public opinion eventually forced Hailsham to close. On the drive back to his recovery center, Tommy asks Kathy to pull over. He walks into the woods and begins screaming. Kathy goes to Tommy and holds him. Soon after, Tommy gives his fourth donation and completes. Kathy drives to a field in Norfolk, where she allows herself to imagine Tommy on the horizon. Then she drives away."
Physicists,"In Part I of The Elegant Universe, “The Edge of Knowledge,” Greene introduces the central problem of modern physics: the incompatibility of Einstein’s theory of general relativity with quantum mechanics. He then lists the physical curiosities—properties of the motion of light, gravity, and the behavior of particles at the subatomic level—that have prevented physicists from establishing a single coherent theory for how the universe works. For most of the twentieth century, physicists contented themselves with describing either the most small-scale or the most large-scale workings of the cosmos, but never both simultaneously. At the end of this section, Greene describes both the objectives and the promise of superstring theory, which attempts to merge the laws of general relativity with those of quantum mechanics.
Without dismissing the importance of electrons and quarks, which are the basis of quantum mechanics, superstring theory depicts the smallest particles in the universe not as dots but as tiny strings of energy. These strings are one hundred billion billion (a quintillion) times smaller than a single atomic nucleus. They vibrate in different patterns, which in turn produce different particle properties. But because these strings are too tiny to locate with current scientific tools, superstring theory is not yet predictable or testable. Therefore, physicists like Greene must work with approximations of equations until more information has been verified. Still, the promise of string theory is tremendous. Only string theory’s conceptual framework offers any possibility of unifying general relativity and quantum mechanics into one complete understanding of how the universe works.
In Part II, “The Dilemma of Space, Time, and the Quanta,” Greene reviews the basic precepts of the two competing theories—first, Einstein’s special and general relativity, and then the “microscopic weirdness” of quantum mechanics. General relativity presupposes a smooth surface of space, but at an ultramicroscopic level (which quantum mechanics has helped unveil), the spatial fabric is subject to violent undulations known as “quantum foam.” Greene also discusses the basic principle of quantum mechanics: the uncertainty principle. The uncertainty principle predicts the impossibility of knowing both the exact location and the velocity of a particle at any given time. Greene goes over the four fundamental forces—the strong force, the weak force, electromagnetism, and gravity—and he describes the complexity of incorporating gravity into the standard model of the first three. In the last chapter of this section, Greene stresses the necessity of finding a new theory that revises both general relativity and quantum mechanics. Like many of his colleagues, Greene simply cannot accept that the universe is, at its core, divided into two contradictory theoretical frameworks.
In Part III, “The Cosmic Symphony,” Greene discusses in detail how superstring theory works. He employs many musical metaphors to suggest how strings “harmonize” or bring together the most puzzling aspects of the cosmos. After praising the elegance and economy of the theory, Greene gives a brief history of its first incarnation in the 1970s, when it was referred to as the bosonic string theory. He also explains the subsequent revisions the theory underwent during the first superstring revolution in 1984. Greene then describes how supersymmetry— a concept that predicts the existence of superpartners that correspond with all known particles—transformed string theory into superstring theory.
With these basics covered, Greene proceeds to one of the oddest claims of string theory: the theory that the universe contains far more dimensions than we can perceive. In its current form, superstring theory postulates the existence of eleven total dimensions: ten of space and one of time. According to the theory, equations of quantum theory can mesh beautifully with relativity if we assume the existence of eleven dimensions. Greene concludes “The Cosmic Symphony” by analyzing the central difficulty of string theory—namely, the lack of experimental evidence for superstring theory. He describes the efforts he and his colleagues have made to develop string theory and refine its underlying mathematical principles. He shows what a Calabi-Yau space (the six-dimensional shape that physicists believe the additional, curled-up dimensions of space will form) may look like.
Part IV, “String Theory and the Fabric of Spacetime,” is the most complicated and involved section of the book. Greene begins with an overview of quantum geometry and the new kind of math that must emerge to explain the universe on an ultramicroscopic scale. He argues that contrary to what physicists previously believed, the fabric of space can be ripped and torn with no catastrophic consequences. He also covers the second superstring revolution, which shows that all five string theories are really part of a single, unified framework called M-theory. It is fitting that no one knows what the “M” signifies, because M-theory is one of the most radical, incompletely understood theories ever to evolve. M-theory proposes the unification of gravity with the three nongravitational forces. It is an extension of string theory that suggests the elementary particles of the universe might include, in addition to strings, two-dimensional membranes and three-dimensional blobs of varying size. Greene ends his discussion of the latest advances in superstring theory by discussing its cosmological implications, what it might reveal about the origins of the universe.
Part V, “Unification in the Twenty-First Century,” concludes the book. It covers the prospects of string theory in the twenty-first century. It describes the advances Greene and other string theorists hope to make in unveiling a single theory to explain the entire universe. For all his optimistic predictions, however, Greene never hesitates to admit that because of its complexity, superstring theory might not be fully understood for many years."
Referred,"Offred is a Handmaid in the Republic of Gilead, a totalitarian and theocratic state that has replaced the United States of America. Because of dangerously low reproduction rates, Handmaids are assigned to bear children for elite couples that have trouble conceiving. Offred serves the Commander and his wife, Serena Joy, a former gospel singer and advocate for “traditional values.” Offred is not the narrator’s real name—Handmaid names consist of the word “of” followed by the name of the Handmaid’s Commander. Every month, when Offred is at the right point in her menstrual cycle, she must have ritualized sex with the Commander while Serena sits behind her, holding her hands. Offred’s freedom, like the freedom of all women, is completely restricted. She can leave the house only on shopping trips, the door to her room cannot be completely shut, and the Eyes, Gilead’s secret police force, watch her every public move.
As Offred tells the story of her daily life, she frequently slips into flashbacks, from which the reader can reconstruct the events leading up to the beginning of the novel. In the old world, before Gilead, Offred had an affair with Luke, a married man. Luke divorced his wife and married Offred, and they had a child together. Offred’s mother was a single mother and feminist activist. Offred’s best friend, Moira, was fiercely independent. The architects of Gilead began their rise to power in an age of readily available pornography, prostitution, and violence against women—when pollution and chemical spills led to declining fertility rates. Using the military, they assassinated the president and members of Congress and launched a coup, claiming that they were taking power temporarily. They cracked down on women’s rights, forbidding women to hold property or jobs. Offred and Luke took their daughter and attempted to flee across the border into Canada, but they were caught and separated from one another, and Offred has seen neither her husband nor her daughter since.
After her capture, Offred’s marriage was voided (because Luke had been divorced), and she was sent to the Rachel and Leah Re-education Center, called the Red Center by its inhabitants. At the center, women were indoctrinated into Gilead’s ideology in preparation for becoming Handmaids. Aunt Lydia supervised the women, giving speeches extolling Gilead’s beliefs that women should be subservient to men and solely concerned with bearing children. Aunt Lydia also argued that such a social order ultimately offers women more respect and safety than the old, pre-Gilead society offered them. Moira is brought to the Red Center, but she escapes, and Offred does not know what becomes of her.
Once Offred is assigned to the Commander’s house, her life settles into a restrictive routine. She takes shopping trips with Ofglen, another Handmaid, and they visit the Wall outside what used to be Harvard University, where the bodies of rebels hang. She must visit the doctor frequently to be checked for disease and other complications, and she must endure the “Ceremony,” in which the Commander reads to the household from the Bible, then goes to the bedroom, where Serena and Offred wait for him, and has sex with Offred.
The first break from her routine occurs when she visits the doctor and he offers to have sex with her to get her pregnant, suggesting that her Commander is probably infertile. She refuses. The doctor makes her uneasy, but his proposition is too risky—she could be sent away if caught. After a Ceremony, the Commander sends his gardener and chauffeur, Nick, to ask Offred to come see him in his study the following night. She begins visiting him regularly. They play Scrabble (which is forbidden, since women are not allowed to read), and he lets her look at old magazines like Vogue. At the end of these secret meetings, he asks her to kiss him.
During one of their shopping trips, Ofglen reveals to Offred that she is a member of “Mayday,” an underground organization dedicated to overthrowing Gilead. Meanwhile, Offred begins to find that the Ceremony feels different and less impersonal now that she knows the Commander. Their nighttime conversations begin to touch on the new order that the Commander and his fellow leaders have created in Gilead. When Offred admits how unhappy she is, the Commander remarks, “[Y]ou can’t make an omelette without breaking eggs.”
After some time has gone by without Offred becoming pregnant, Serena suggests that Offred have sex with Nick secretly and pass the child off as the Commander’s. Serena promises to bring Offred a picture of her daughter if she sleeps with Nick, and Offred realizes with horror that Serena has always known where her daughter was. The same night that Offred is to sleep with Nick, the Commander secretly takes her out to a club called Jezebel’s, where the Commanders mingle with prostitutes. Offred sees Moira working there. The two women meet in a bathroom, and Offred learns that Moira was captured just before she crossed the border. She chose life in Jezebel’s over being sent to the Colonies, where most political prisoners and others who pose a threat to Gilead are sent. After that night at Jezebel’s, Offred says, she never sees Moira again. The Commander takes Offred upstairs after a few hours, and they have sex in what used to be a hotel room. She tries to feign passion.
Soon after Offred returns from Jezebel’s, late at night, Serena arrives and tells Offred to go to Nick’s room. Offred and Nick have sex. Soon they begin to sleep together frequently, without anyone’s knowledge. Offred becomes caught up in the affair and ignores Ofglen’s requests that she gather information from the Commander for Mayday. One day, all the Handmaids take part in a group execution of a supposed rapist, supervised by Aunt Lydia. Ofglen strikes the first blow. Later, she tells Offred that the so-called rapist was a member of Mayday and that she hit him to put him out of his misery.
Shortly thereafter, Offred goes out shopping, and a new Ofglen meets her. This new woman is not part of Mayday, and she tells Offred that the old Ofglen hanged herself when she saw the secret police coming for her. At home, Serena has found out about Offred’s trip to Jezebel’s, and she sends her to her room, promising punishment. Offred waits there, and she sees a black van from the Eyes approach. Then Nick comes in and tells her that the Eyes are really Mayday members who have come to save her. Offred leaves with them, over the Commander’s futile objections, on her way either to prison or to freedom—she does not know which.
The novel closes with an epilogue from 2195, after Gilead has fallen, written in the form of a lecture given by Professor Pieixoto. He explains the formation and customs of Gilead in objective, analytical language. He discusses the significance of Offred’s story, which has been found on cassette tapes in Bangor, Maine. Pieixoto suggests that Nick arranged Offred’s escape but that her fate after that is unknown. She could have escaped to Canada or England, or she could have been recaptured."
Islands,"As Island of the Blue Dolphins opens, Karana and her brother, Ramo see a ship approaching their island. When the ship lands, the chief of their village (also their father), Chowig goes to meet the visitors, along with a number of his warriors. The representative of the strangers is Captain Orlov, a Russian, who has come with a native American tribe known as the Aleuts to hunt otter on the island of the blue dolphins (known to its inhabitants as Ghalas-at). There is disagreement between the two, for the Aleuts had caused trouble on the island some years before. Finally, Chowig and Orlov reach an agreement, and the people of Ghalas-at let the Aleuts hunt otter on their island in return for half of their profits in the form of jewelry and iron spearheads. The Aleuts set up camp at one end of the island, and the Aleuts and the people of Ghalas-at keep close watch over on another, suspicious of being double-crossed. When the Aleuts start getting ready to leave, Chowig and his warriors ask for their payment. The sum is unsatisfactory, however, and the two parties disagree. A fight breaks out. When the battle is done, the Aleuts have escaped, and many of the men of Ghalat-at have been killed, among them Chowig.
A new chief, Kimki, comes to power, and after a dreary and sad winter, he decides his tribe should leave Gahlas-at. He sets off alone to prepare a way for them in a new county he had visited as a boy. He is gone for a long time, but one day a ship with white sails comes to Ghalas-at. It carries a group of white men who say they were sent by Kimki to take the islanders away. The day is stormy, so the villagers need to board the boat quickly before the ship runs aground on the rocks of the island. In the confusion, Ramo forgets his hunting spear. Karana tells him there is no time to go back for it, but once Karana is on the ship, Ramo is nowhere to be found. As the ship pulls away from the island, Karana sees Ramo, with his spear, back on the beach. Though others on the boat try to restrain her, Karana jumps into the water and swims back to the island.
Back on the island, Ramo and Karana work hard to provide for themselves. They gather food and prepare to stay for some time on the island—at least until the ship returns to take them away. Though Ramo is young, he is very confident and tries to do many things on his own. One morning, Karana awakes to find that Ramo is gone. She goes out to look for him, only to find him dead, killed by the wild dogs of the island.
After Ramo is killed, Karana decides to leave her village forever. She burns it and sets up camp on a rock near the headland. She makes tools to defend herself, although the laws of her tribe bar a woman from making weapons. She watches everyday for the ship that will take her away, but it never comes. One day, she takes a canoe and tries to make the journey herself. Though she is able to paddle a great distance, her canoe starts to leak after a few days, and, realizing she cannot reach her destination, she turns back.
Knowing that she could be on Ghalas-at for some time, Karana builds herself a house and some stronger weapons. Once she has finished these necessities, Karana decides it is time to exact her revenge on the wild dogs that killed her brother. She used fire to scare them out of their cave, and strikes down their leader along with several others. The lead dog is strong, however, and is able to escape even with an arrow lodged deeply in his chest. Days later, Karana finds the same dog, barely alive. Instead of killing him, she takes him home and nurses him back to health. The two become fast friends, and the dog, whom Karana calls Rontu even defends her from his former pack mates.
One day, the Aleuts, who had killed so many of Karana's friends and family, return to Ghalas-at. Karana sets up a second house in a cave to hide from them. One day, however, an Aleut girl discovers Karana by her house. Though Karana is wary and suspicious of the girl, whose name is Tutok, the two eventually become close friends. They exchange gifts and talk by the fire (though they do not speak the same language). When the Aleuts have finished hunting, the girl has to go with them, and Karana feels more alone than ever.
Karana continues her work on her house, and becomes more and more comfortable on the island. She makes herself new clothes and befriends a number of other animals, including birds, an otter, and a fox. Years later, when Rontu dies, Karana takes his son from the cave of the wild dogs. She tames the dog, and names him Rontu-Aru.
After her long stay on the Island of the Blue Dolphins, another ship comes to her harbor. Realizing that it is time for her to leave, and missing human contact, Karana gathers her things and, with Rontu-Aru, leaves Ghalas-at."
Foregoing,"On the night that a fire rages between the woods of Fanteland and Asanteland, Effia is born. Throughout her childhood, her mother, Baaba, is extremely cruel. As Effia grows, Baaba tells her to keep the fact that she has begun menstruating a secret so that she cannot marry their village’s new chief. Instead, Effia is sent to marry the British governor of Cape Coast Castle, James Collins. While pregnant, Effia returns to her village as her father is dying. There, she learns from her brother Fiifi that Baaba was not her real mother. Her mother was an enslaved girl named Maame who ran away into the fire the night Effia was born. Though Effia doesn’t know this, Maame married a Big Man in an Asante village and gave birth to another girl, Esi. Esi has a privileged childhood but is captured at fifteen and taken to the dungeon of the Cape Coast Castle. There, she is raped and then put on a slave ship to America.
Effia’s son Quey has a lonely childhood at the castle, though he makes friends with a boy named Cudjo. However, after Quey’s father witnesses a tender moment between the two boys, he sends Quey to live in London. Quey later goes to his mother’s village to help his uncle, Fiifi, with his work in the slave trade. Though this is not the life Quey wants, he marries the daughter of an Asante king, Nana Yaa, whom Fiifi kidnapped. Meanwhile, Esi’s daughter Ness is enslaved on a plantation in Alabama. At a previous plantation, she was forced to marry another slave, Sam, and they had a child named Kojo. One day, Ness, Sam, and Kojo attempt to escape with the help of a woman named Aku, but Ness and Sam are caught. Back at the plantation, Ness is whipped and Sam is lynched.
When Quey and Nana Yaa’s son, James, travels with them to Nana Yaa’s father’s funeral, he becomes enamored with a girl named Akosua, who chastises his family’s involvement in the slave trade. Though James is promised to marry another woman, he’s determined to marry Akosua. Eventually, James fakes his own death and finds Akosua. On Esi’s side, Aku and Kojo escape to Maryland, where Kojo, or “Jo,” works as a deckhand. Jo and his wife Anna worry about their family’s safety after the passage of the Fugitive Slave Act. One day, Anna doesn’t return home from work. After a few weeks, Jo learns that Anna was taken by a white man. Once his children are grown, a broken Jo moves to New York.
Quey and Akosua’s daughter, Abena, is unmarried at the age of twenty-five, though she is waiting for her childhood friend Ohene Nyarko to take her as his second wife. Abena and Ohene begin sleeping together, but he cannot promise to marry her until he has a good harvest. For years, the harvest is bad, and the village blames Abena. Eventually, Ohene is able to grow cocoa but promised to marry the daughter of the man who sold the plants to him. Now pregnant, Abena leaves the village for a missionary church.
In America, Jo and Anna’s son H is born on a plantation just after Anna has killed herself. H works as a sharecropper after the Civil War. After being arrested for looking at a white woman, H works in the mines as a convict. When his sentence is up, H moves to Pratt City, where he continues to work in mines but joins a union to fight for better pay and working conditions. Though his wife, Ethe, left him years earlier, he writes to her, and she returns to him.
Abena’s daughter, Akua, grows up in the missionary where her mother Abena lived after leaving the village. Akua leaves the church after the missionary tells her he drowned Abena while attempting to baptize her. Akua marries and has two daughters and a son, though she is plagued by dreams of a woman made of fire. One night, in her sleep, Akua burns her family’s hut. Only Akua, her husband, and her son, Yaw, survive. Meanwhile, H and Ethe’s daughter, Willie, moves to Harlem with her husband, Robert, and their son, Carson. Robert is light-skinned and passes as white in Harlem, which allows him to easily find work. One night, while cleaning a jazz club, Willie runs into Robert in the bathroom, and Robert’s white colleagues force him to assault her. Robert then leaves Willie. A few years later, Willie sees Robert with a white wife and son.
Yaw grows up to be a history teacher, though he has trouble finding a wife due to the scars on his face from the fire his mother set. He eventually falls in love with his house girl, Esther. She encourages Yaw to make peace with Akua, whom he hasn’t seen since he was a baby. Yaw and Esther visit Akua, who explains that she set the fire because she was haunted by the evil in their lineage. Yaw forgives his mother.
Willie’s son Carson, who now goes by the name Sonny, works for the NAACP and is involved in the Civil Rights Movement, though he feels frustrated with the lack of progress. Sonny becomes addicted to heroin after a woman, Amani, introduces him to the drug. One day, Willie explains to Sonny what happened to his father. With this knowledge, Sonny decides to finally get clean.
Yaw and Esther move to Alabama with their daughter, Marjorie. Marjorie feels a deep connection to her grandmother and to Ghana and does not fit in with either the Black or white kids in Alabama. Marjorie develops feelings for her friend Graham, a white boy, though he feels they cannot be together due to their different races. Marjorie later meets Marcus, Sonny and Amani’s son, while they are both graduate students at Stanford. Marcus and Marjorie travel together to Ghana, where Marcus is overwhelmed with emotions on visiting the Cape Coast Castle. They swim together in the water, and Marjorie welcomes Marcus home."
Accounting,"Guy Montag is a fireman who burns books in a futuristic American city. In Montag’s world, firemen start fires rather than putting them out. The people in this society do not read books, enjoy nature, spend time by themselves, think independently, or have meaningful conversations. Instead, they drive very fast, watch excessive amounts of television on wall-size sets, and listen to the radio on “Seashell Radio” sets attached to their ears.
Montag encounters a gentle seventeen-year-old girl named Clarisse McClellan, who opens his eyes to the emptiness of his life with her innocently penetrating questions and her unusual love of people and nature. Over the next few days, Montag experiences a series of disturbing events. First, his wife, Mildred, attempts suicide by swallowing a bottle of sleeping pills. Then, when he responds to an alarm that an old woman has a stash of hidden literature, the woman shocks him by choosing to be burned alive along with her books. A few days later, he hears that Clarisse has been killed by a speeding car. Montag’s dissatisfaction with his life increases, and he begins to search for a solution in a stash of books that he has stolen from his own fires and hidden inside an air-conditioning vent.
When Montag fails to show up for work, his fire chief, Beatty, pays a visit to his house. Beatty explains that it’s normal for a fireman to go through a phase of wondering what books have to offer, and he delivers a dizzying monologue explaining how books came to be banned in the first place. According to Beatty, special-interest groups and other “minorities” objected to books that offended them. Soon, books all began to look the same, as writers tried to avoid offending anybody. This was not enough, however, and society as a whole decided to simply burn books rather than permit conflicting opinions. Beatty tells Montag to take twenty-four hours or so to see if his stolen books contain anything worthwhile and then turn them in for incineration. Montag begins a long and frenzied night of reading.
Overwhelmed by the task of reading, Montag looks to his wife for help and support, but she prefers television to her husband’s company and cannot understand why he would want to take the terrible risk of reading books. He remembers that he once met a retired English professor named Faber sitting in a park, and he decides that this man might be able to help him understand what he reads. He visits Faber, who tells him that the value of books lies in the detailed awareness of life that they contain. Faber says that Montag needs not only books but also the leisure to read them and the freedom to act upon their ideas.
Faber agrees to help Montag with his reading, and they concoct a risky scheme to overthrow the status quo. Faber will contact a printer and begin reproducing books, and Montag will plant books in the homes of firemen to discredit the profession and to destroy the machinery of censorship. Faber gives him a two-way radio earpiece (the “green bullet”) so that he can hear what Montag hears and talk to him secretly.
Montag goes home, and soon two of his wife’s friends arrive to watch television. The women discuss their families and the war that is about to be declared in an extremely frivolous manner. Their superficiality angers him, and he takes out a book of poetry and reads “Dover Beach” by Matthew Arnold. Faber buzzes in his ear for him to be quiet, and Mildred tries to explain that the poetry reading is a standard way for firemen to demonstrate the uselessness of literature. The women are extremely disturbed by the poem and leave to file a complaint against Montag.
Montag goes to the fire station and hands over one of his books to Beatty. Beatty confuses Montag by barraging him with contradictory quotations from great books. Beatty exploits these contradictions to show that literature is morbid and dangerously complex, and that it deserves incineration. Suddenly, the alarm sounds, and they rush off to answer the call, only to find that the alarm is at Montag’s own house. Mildred gets into a cab with her suitcase, and Montag realizes that his own wife has betrayed him.
Beatty forces Montag to burn the house himself; when he is done, Beatty places him under arrest. When Beatty continues to berate Montag, Montag turns the flamethrower on his superior and proceeds to burn him to ashes. Montag knocks the other firemen unconscious and runs. The Mechanical Hound, a monstrous machine that Beatty has set to attack Montag, pounces and injects Montag’s leg with a large dose of anesthetic. Montag manages to destroy it with his flamethrower; then he walks off the numbness in his leg and escapes with some books that were hidden in his backyard. He hides these in another fireman’s house and calls in an alarm from a pay phone.
Montag goes to Faber’s house, where he learns that a new Hound has been put on his trail, along with several helicopters and a television crew. Faber tells Montag that he is leaving for St. Louis to see a retired printer who may be able to help them. Montag gives Faber some money and tells him how to remove Montag’s scent from his house so the Hound will not enter it. Montag then takes some of Faber’s old clothes and runs off toward the river. The whole city watches as the chase unfolds on TV, but Montag manages to escape in the river and change into Faber’s clothes to disguise his scent. He drifts downstream into the country and follows a set of abandoned railroad tracks until he finds a group of renegade intellectuals (“the Book People”), led by a man named Granger, who welcome him. They are a part of a nationwide network of book lovers who have memorized many great works of literature and philosophy. They hope that they may be of some help to mankind in the aftermath of the war that has just been declared. Montag’s role is to memorize the Book of Ecclesiastes. Enemy jets appear in the sky and completely obliterate the city with bombs. Montag and his new friends move on to search for survivors and rebuild civilization."
Forbear,"General Prologue
At the Tabard Inn, a tavern in Southwark, near London, the narrator joins a company of twenty-nine pilgrims. The pilgrims, like the narrator, are traveling to the shrine of the martyr Saint Thomas Becket in Canterbury. The narrator gives a descriptive account of twenty-seven of these pilgrims, including a Knight, Squire, Yeoman, Prioress, Monk, Friar, Merchant, Clerk, Man of Law, Franklin, Haberdasher, Carpenter, Weaver, Dyer, Tapestry-Weaver, Cook, Shipman, Physician, Wife, Parson, Plowman, Miller, Manciple, Reeve, Summoner, Pardoner, and Host. (He does not describe the Second Nun or the Nun’s Priest, although both characters appear later in the book.)
The Host, whose name, we find out in the Prologue to the Cook’s Tale, is Harry Bailey, suggests that the group ride together and entertain one another with stories. He decides that each pilgrim will tell two stories on the way to Canterbury and two on the way back. Whomever he judges to be the best storyteller will receive a meal at Bailey’s tavern, courtesy of the other pilgrims. The pilgrims draw lots and determine that the Knight will tell the first tale.
The Knight’s Tale
Theseus, duke of Athens, imprisons Arcite and Palamon, two knights from Thebes (another city in ancient Greece). From their prison, the knights see and fall in love with Theseus’s sister-in-law, Emelye. Through the intervention of a friend, Arcite is freed, but he is banished from Athens. He returns in disguise and becomes a page in Emelye’s chamber. Palamon escapes from prison, and the two meet and fight over Emelye. Theseus apprehends them and arranges a tournament between the two knights and their allies, with Emelye as the prize. Arcite wins, but he is accidentally thrown from his horse and dies. Palamon then marries Emelye.
The Miller’s Prologue and Tale
The Host asks the Monk to tell the next tale, but the drunken Miller interrupts and insists that his tale should be the next. He tells the story of an impoverished student named Nicholas, who persuades his landlord’s sexy young wife, Alisoun, to spend the night with him. He convinces his landlord, a carpenter named John, that the second flood is coming, and tricks him into spending the night in a tub hanging from the ceiling of his barn. Absolon, a young parish clerk who is also in love with Alisoun, appears outside the window of the room where Nicholas and Alisoun lie together.
When Absolon begs Alisoun for a kiss, she sticks her rear end out the window in the dark and lets him kiss it. Absolon runs and gets a red-hot poker, returns to the window, and asks for another kiss; when Nicholas sticks his bottom out the window and farts, Absolon brands him on the buttocks. Nicholas’s cries for water make the carpenter think that the flood has come, so the carpenter cuts the rope connecting his tub to the ceiling, falls down, and breaks his arm.
The Reeve’s Prologue and Tale
Because he also does carpentry, the Reeve takes offense at the Miller’s tale of a stupid carpenter, and counters with his own tale of a dishonest miller. The Reeve tells the story of two students, John and Alayn, who go to the mill to watch the miller grind their corn, so that he won’t have a chance to steal any. But the miller unties their horse, and while they chase it, he steals some of the flour he has just ground for them. By the time the students catch the horse, it is dark, so they spend the night in the miller’s house. That night, Alayn seduces the miller’s daughter, and John seduces his wife. When the miller wakes up and finds out what has happened, he tries to beat the students. His wife, thinking that her husband is actually one of the students, hits the miller over the head with a staff. The students take back their stolen goods and leave.
The Cook’s Prologue and Tale
The Cook particularly enjoys the Reeve’s Tale, and offers to tell another funny tale. The tale concerns an apprentice named Perkyn who drinks and dances so much that he is called “Perkyn Reveler.” Finally, Perkyn’s master decides that he would rather his apprentice leave to revel than stay home and corrupt the other servants. Perkyn arranges to stay with a friend who loves drinking and gambling, and who has a wife who is a prostitute. The tale breaks off, unfinished, after fifty-eight lines.
The Man of Law’s Introduction, Prologue, Tale, and Epilogue
The Host reminds his fellow pilgrims to waste no time, because lost time cannot be regained. He asks the Man of Law to tell the next tale. The Man of Law agrees, apologizing that he cannot tell any suitable tale that Chaucer has not already told—Chaucer may be unskilled as a poet, says the Man of Law, but he has told more stories of lovers than Ovid, and he doesn’t print tales of incest as John Gower does (Gower was a contemporary of Chaucer). In the Prologue to his tale, the Man of Law laments the miseries of poverty. He then remarks how fortunate merchants are, and says that his tale is one told to him by a merchant.
In the tale, the Muslim sultan of Syria converts his entire sultanate (including himself) to Christianity in order to persuade the emperor of Rome to give him his daughter, Custance, in marriage. The sultan’s mother and her attendants remain secretly faithful to Islam. The mother tells her son she wishes to hold a banquet for him and all the Christians. At the banquet, she massacres her son and all the Christians except for Custance, whom she sets adrift in a rudderless ship. After years of floating, Custance runs ashore in Northumberland, where a constable and his wife, Hermengyld, offer her shelter. She converts them to Christianity.
One night, Satan makes a young knight sneak into Hermengyld’s chamber and murder Hermengyld. He places the bloody knife next to Custance, who sleeps in the same chamber. When the constable returns home, accompanied by Alla, the king of Northumberland, he finds his slain wife. He tells Alla the story of how Custance was found, and Alla begins to pity the girl. He decides to look more deeply into the murder. Just as the knight who murdered Hermengyld is swearing that Custance is the true murderer, he is struck down and his eyes burst out of his face, proving his guilt to Alla and the crowd. The knight is executed, Alla and many others convert to Christianity, and Custance and Alla marry.
While Alla is away in Scotland, Custance gives birth to a boy named Mauricius. Alla’s mother, Donegild, intercepts a letter from Custance to Alla and substitutes a counterfeit one that claims that the child is disfigured and bewitched. She then intercepts Alla’s reply, which claims that the child should be kept and loved no matter how malformed. Donegild substitutes a letter saying that Custance and her son are banished and should be sent away on the same ship on which Custance arrived. Alla returns home, finds out what has happened, and kills Donegild.
After many adventures at sea, including an attempted rape, Custance ends up back in Rome, where she reunites with Alla, who has made a pilgrimage there to atone for killing his mother. She also reunites with her father, the emperor. Alla and Custance return to England, but Alla dies after a year, so Custance returns, once more, to Rome. Mauricius becomes the next Roman emperor.
Following the Man of Law’s Tale, the Host asks the Parson to tell the next tale, but the Parson reproaches him for swearing, and they fall to bickering.
The Wife of Bath’s Prologue and Tale
The Wife of Bath gives a lengthy account of her feelings about marriage. Quoting from the Bible, the Wife argues against those who believe it is wrong to marry more than once, and she explains how she dominated and controlled each of her five husbands. She married her fifth husband, Jankyn, for love instead of money. After the Wife has rambled on for a while, the Friar butts in to complain that she is taking too long, and the Summoner retorts that friars are like flies, always meddling. The Friar promises to tell a tale about a summoner, and the Summoner promises to tell a tale about a friar. The Host cries for everyone to quiet down and allow the Wife to commence her tale.
In her tale, a young knight of King Arthur’s court rapes a maiden; to atone for his crime, Arthur’s queen sends him on a quest to discover what women want most. An ugly old woman promises the knight that she will tell him the secret if he promises to do whatever she wants for saving his life. He agrees, and she tells him women want control of their husbands and their own lives. They go together to Arthur’s queen, and the old woman’s answer turns out to be correct. The old woman then tells the knight that he must marry her. When the knight confesses later that he is repulsed by her appearance, she gives him a choice: she can either be ugly and faithful, or beautiful and unfaithful. The knight tells her to make the choice herself, and she rewards him for giving her control of the marriage by rendering herself both beautiful and faithful.
The Friar’s Prologue and Tale
The Friar speaks approvingly of the Wife of Bath’s Tale, and offers to lighten things up for the company by telling a funny story about a lecherous summoner. The Summoner does not object, but he promises to pay the Friar back in his own tale. The Friar tells of an archdeacon who carries out the law without mercy, especially to lechers. The archdeacon has a summoner who has a network of spies working for him, to let him know who has been lecherous.
The summoner extorts money from those he’s sent to summon, charging them more money than he should for penance. He tries to serve a summons on a yeoman who is actually a devil in disguise. After comparing notes on their treachery and extortion, the devil vanishes, but when the summoner tries to prosecute an old wealthy widow unfairly, the widow cries out that the summoner should be taken to hell. The devil follows the woman’s instructions and drags the summoner off to hell.
The Summoner’s Prologue and Tale
The Summoner, furious at the Friar’s Tale, asks the company to let him tell the next tale. First, he tells the company that there is little difference between friars and fiends, and that when an angel took a friar down to hell to show him the torments there, the friar asked why there were no friars in hell; the angel then pulled up Satan’s tail and 20,000 friars came out of his ass.
In the Summoner’s Tale, a friar begs for money from a dying man named Thomas and his wife, who have recently lost their child. The friar shamelessly exploits the couple’s misfortunes to extract money from them, so Thomas tells the friar that he is sitting on something that he will bequeath to the friars. The friar reaches for his bequest, and Thomas lets out an enormous fart. The friar complains to the lord of the manor, whose squire promises to divide the fart evenly among all the friars.
The Clerk’s Prologue and Tale
The Host asks the Clerk to cheer up and tell a merry tale, and the Clerk agrees to tell a tale by the Italian poet Petrarch. Griselde is a hardworking peasant who marries into the aristocracy. Her husband tests her fortitude in several ways, including pretending to kill her children and divorcing her. He punishes her one final time by forcing her to prepare for his wedding to a new wife. She does all this dutifully, her husband tells her that she has always been and will always be his wife (the divorce was a fraud), and they live happily ever after.
The Merchant’s Prologue, Tale, and Epilogue
The Merchant reflects on the great difference between the patient Griselde of the Clerk’s Tale and the horrible shrew he has been married to for the past two months. The Host asks him to tell a story of the evils of marriage, and he complies. Against the advice of his friends, an old knight named January marries May, a beautiful young woman. She is less than impressed by his enthusiastic sexual efforts, and conspires to cheat on him with his squire, Damien. When blind January takes May into his garden to copulate with her, she tells him she wants to eat a pear, and he helps her up into the pear tree, where she has sex with Damien. Pluto, the king of the faeries, restores January’s sight, but May, caught in the act, assures him that he must still be blind. The Host prays to God to keep him from marrying a wife like the one the Merchant describes.
The Squire’s Introduction and Tale
The Host calls upon the Squire to say something about his favorite subject, love, and the Squire willingly complies. King Cambyuskan of the Mongol Empire is visited on his birthday by a knight bearing gifts from the king of Arabia and India. He gives Cambyuskan and his daughter Canacee a magic brass horse, a magic mirror, a magic ring that gives Canacee the ability to understand the language of birds, and a sword with the power to cure any wound it creates. She rescues a dying female falcon that narrates how her consort abandoned her for the love of another. The Squire’s Tale is either unfinished by Chaucer or is meant to be interrupted by the Franklin, who interjects that he wishes his own son were as eloquent as the Squire. The Host expresses annoyance at the Franklin’s interruption, and orders him to begin the next tale.
The Franklin’s Prologue and Tale
The Franklin says that his tale is a familiar Breton lay, a folk ballad of ancient Brittany. Dorigen, the heroine, awaits the return of her husband, Arveragus, who has gone to England to win honor in feats of arms. She worries that the ship bringing her husband home will wreck itself on the coastal rocks, and she promises Aurelius, a young man who falls in love with her, that she will give her body to him if he clears the rocks from the coast. Aurelius hires a student learned in magic to create the illusion that the rocks have disappeared. Arveragus returns home and tells his wife that she must keep her promise to Aurelius. Aurelius is so impressed by Arveragus’s honorable act that he generously absolves her of the promise, and the magician, in turn, generously absolves Aurelius of the money he owes.
The Physician’s Tale
Appius the judge lusts after Virginia, the beautiful daughter of Virginius. Appius persuades a churl named Claudius to declare her his slave, stolen from him by Virginius. Appius declares that Virginius must hand over his daughter to Claudius. Virginius tells his daughter that she must die rather than suffer dishonor, and she virtuously consents to her father’s cutting her head off. Appius sentences Virginius to death, but the Roman people, aware of Appius’s hijinks, throw him into prison, where he kills himself.
The Pardoner’s Introduction, Prologue, and Tale
The Host is dismayed by the tragic injustice of the Physician’s Tale, and asks the Pardoner to tell something merry. The other pilgrims contradict the Host, demanding a moral tale, which the Pardoner agrees to tell after he eats and drinks. The Pardoner tells the company how he cheats people out of their money by preaching that money is the root of all evil. His tale describes three riotous youths who go looking for Death, thinking that they can kill him. An old man tells them that they will find Death under a tree. Instead, they find eight bushels of gold, which they plot to sneak into town under cover of darkness.
The youngest goes into town to fetch food and drink, but brings back poison, hoping to have the gold all to himself. His companions kill him to enrich their own shares, then drink the poison and die under the tree. His tale complete, the Pardoner offers to sell the pilgrims pardons, and singles out the Host to come kiss his relics. The Host infuriates the Pardoner by accusing him of fraud, but the Knight persuades the two to kiss and bury their differences.
The Shipman’s Tale
The Shipman’s Tale features a monk who tricks a merchant’s wife into having sex with him by borrowing money from the merchant, then giving it to the wife so she can repay her own debt to her husband, in exchange for sexual favors. When the monk sees the merchant next, he tells him that he returned the merchant’s money to his wife. The wife realizes she has been duped, but she boldly tells her husband to forgive her debt: she will repay it in bed. The Host praises the Shipman’s story, and asks the Prioress for a tale.
The Prioress’s Prologue and Tale
The Prioress calls on the Virgin Mary to guide her tale. In an Asian city, a Christian school is located at the edge of a Jewish ghetto. An angelic seven-year-old boy, a widow’s son, attends the school. He is a devout Christian, and loves to sing Alma Redemptoris (Gracious Mother of the Redeemer). Singing the song on his way through the ghetto, some Jews hire a murderer to slit his throat and throw him into a latrine. The Jews refuse to tell the widow where her son is, but he miraculously begins to sing Alma Redemptoris, so the Christian people recover his body, and the magistrate orders the murdering Jews to be drawn apart by wild horses and then hanged.
The Prologue and Tale of Sir Thopas
The Host, after teasing Chaucer the narrator about his appearance, asks him to tell a tale. Chaucer says that he only knows one tale, then launches into a parody of bad poetry—the Tale of Sir Thopas. Sir Thopas rides about looking for an elf-queen to marry until he is confronted by a giant. The narrator’s doggerel continues in this vein until the Host can bear no more and interrupts him. Chaucer asks him why he can’t tell his tale, since it is the best he knows, and the Host explains that his rhyme isn’t worth a turd. He encourages Chaucer to tell a prose tale.
The Tale of Melibee
Chaucer’s second tale is the long, moral prose story of Melibee. Melibee’s house is raided by his foes, who beat his wife, Prudence, and severely wound his daughter, Sophie, in her feet, hands, ears, nose, and mouth. Prudence advises him not to rashly pursue vengeance on his enemies, and he follows her advice, putting his foes’ punishment in her hands. She forgives them for the outrages done to her, in a model of Christian forbearance and forgiveness.
The Monk’s Prologue and Tale
The Host wishes that his own wife were as patient as Melibee’s, and calls upon the Monk to tell the next tale. First he teases the Monk, pointing out that the Monk is clearly no poor cloisterer. The Monk takes it all in stride and tells a series of tragic falls, in which noble figures are brought low: Lucifer, Adam, Sampson, Hercules, Nebuchadnezzar, Belshazzar, Zenobia, Pedro of Castile, and down through the ages.
The Nun’s Priest’s Prologue, Tale, and Epilogue
After seventeen noble “falls” narrated by the Monk, the Knight interrupts, and the Host calls upon the Nun’s Priest to deliver something more lively. The Nun’s Priest tells of Chanticleer the Rooster, who is carried off by a flattering fox who tricks him into closing his eyes and displaying his crowing abilities. Chanticleer turns the tables on the fox by persuading him to open his mouth and brag to the barnyard about his feat, upon which Chanticleer falls out of the fox’s mouth and escapes. The Host praises the Nun’s Priest’s Tale, adding that if the Nun’s Priest were not in holy orders, he would be as sexually potent as Chanticleer.
The Second Nun’s Prologue and Tale
In her Prologue, the Second Nun explains that she will tell a saint’s life, that of Saint Cecilia, for this saint set an excellent example through her good works and wise teachings. She focuses particularly on the story of Saint Cecilia’s martyrdom. Before Cecilia’s new husband, Valerian, can take her virginity, she sends him on a pilgrimage to Pope Urban, who converts him to Christianity. An angel visits Valerian, who asks that his brother Tiburce be granted the grace of Christian conversion as well. All three—Cecilia, Tiburce, and Valerian—are put to death by the Romans.
The Canon’s Yeoman’s Prologue and Tale
When the Second Nun’s Tale is finished, the company is overtaken by a black-clad Canon and his Yeoman, who have heard of the pilgrims and their tales and wish to participate. The Yeoman brags to the company about how he and the Canon create the illusion that they are alchemists, and the Canon departs in shame at having his secrets discovered. The Yeoman tells a tale of how a canon defrauded a priest by creating the illusion of alchemy using sleight of hand.
The Manciple’s Prologue and Tale
The Host pokes fun at the Cook, riding at the back of the company, blind drunk. The Cook is unable to honor the Host’s request that he tell a tale, and the Manciple criticizes him for his drunkenness. The Manciple relates the legend of a white crow, taken from the Roman poet Ovid’s Metamorphoses and one of the tales in The Arabian Nights. In it, Phoebus’s talking white crow informs him that his wife is cheating on him. Phoebus kills the wife, pulls out the crow’s white feathers, and curses it with blackness.
The Parson’s Prologue and Tale
As the company enters a village in the late afternoon, the Host calls upon the Parson to give them a fable. Refusing to tell a fictional story because it would go against the rule set by St. Paul, the Parson delivers a lengthy treatise on the Seven Deadly Sins, instead.
Chaucer’s Retraction
Chaucer appeals to readers to credit Jesus Christ as the inspiration for anything in his book that they like, and to attribute what they don’t like to his own ignorance and lack of ability. He retracts and prays for forgiveness for all of his works dealing with secular and pagan subjects, asking only to be remembered for what he has written of saints’ lives and homilies."
Before,"Grant Wiggins has been teaching on a plantation outside Bayonne, Louisiana, for several years when a slow-witted man named Jefferson is convicted of murder and sentenced to death. Jefferson claims he is innocent of the crime. He says he was on his way to a bar, but changed his mind and decided to tag along with two men who were on their way to a liquor store. Upon arriving there, the two men began arguing with the storeowner, and a shootout ensued. The storeowner and the two men died, and Jefferson remained at the scene of the crime. He was arrested and tried for murder. Jefferson’s lawyer argues in court that Jefferson is nothing but a poor fool, hardly more worthwhile than a hog, and therefore incapable of plotting such a scheme. The jury quickly brings back a guilty verdict.
	Upon hearing the lawyer’s speech, Jefferson’s godmother, Miss Emma, resolves to help Jefferson die like a man, not a hog. She asks Grant to help her, knowing that he will resist. Grant left many years prior to attend college, and he returned an educated man. He deplores the injustices done to his fellow black men, but he does not want to get involved in Jefferson’s case. However, after considerable pressure from his aunt, Tante Lou, he agrees to try to help Jefferson. Grant, Miss Emma, and Grant’s aunt go to visit Jefferson in his cell, and they discover that he too heard the lawyer’s words and has taken them to heart. Silent and moody, Jefferson resists Grant’s feeble attempts to reach him. The three visitors spend an uncomfortable hour in the cell and then leave.
	During the next few visits, Jefferson continues to frustrate Grant’s attempts to communicate. When Grant attempts to teach Jefferson about dignity, Jefferson insists that dignity is for “youmans,” not hogs. He eats and snuffles in imitation of a hog and tries to anger Grant with stubbornness and malice, but Grant maintains his patience. Each hour-long visit ends in failure, but Grant continues to try to reach Jefferson. On his fourth visit, Grant sparks a conversation with Jefferson about his final meal. Jefferson admits that he wants a gallon of vanilla ice cream because, although he loves ice cream, he has never had more than a thimbleful at a time. This admission begins to break down the barrier between the two men. Grant borrows money from some townspeople and buys Jefferson a small radio. On his next visit, he brings Jefferson a notebook and asks him to write down whatever thoughts come to his mind. Jefferson promises to do so, and by Grant’s next visit, Jefferson has filled most of a page with thoughts concerning the difference between hogs and men.
	Grant’s relationships with his girlfriend Vivian and with Reverend Ambrose begin to intensify. Despite her love for Grant, Vivian dislikes his tendency to think only of himself, showing little regard for her needs. Grant uses Vivian to escape the troubles of his life, and he continually suggests that they run away from their hometown and their past in the South. The Reverend Ambrose, himself unable to reach Jefferson, urges Grant to put aside his atheistic beliefs and help save not just Jefferson’s character, but his soul. The Reverend declares that Grant must learn to tell lies for the good of others.
	Grant focuses his energy on Jefferson and tries to explain the importance of Jefferson’s death. Jefferson asks Grant if he believes in heaven and Grant replies that he does not, although he qualifies this remark by saying that his atheism does not make him a good man. In fact, Grant says, Jefferson will save even Grant’s atheistic soul if he carries the cross for the sinners on earth. Grant explains that the black community in the quarter has spent centuries enslaved to white men, and that when Jefferson’s attorney called him a hog, he attacked the will and intelligence of the entire black society. In consequence, Jefferson now has the opportunity to stand up for his community. He has become a symbol to his people, and the manner in which he faces his death will bear on their self--confidence and potential.
	Over the next few weeks, Jefferson continues to write in his journal. In March, the governor of Louisiana sets the execution date for two weeks after Easter. As news of Jefferson’s impending death spreads through the town, more and more people begin to visit him. Young children and old men, strangers and friends, all come to -Jefferson’s cell to speak to him. The onslaught of attention makes Jefferson begin to understand the enormity of the task that Grant has given him. He realizes that he has become much more than an ordinary man and that his death will represent much more than an ordinary death. Elated by Jefferson’s progress, Grant nevertheless dreads the execution day, when that progress will be tested.
	Grant cannot bring himself to attend the execution, for he has grown very close to Jefferson. At the time the execution is scheduled to take place, he orders his students to kneel by their desks in honor of Jefferson. He steps outside the classroom, distressed and bewildered. He knows he should have attended the execution. A few minutes later, a deputy comes down from the courthouse and informs Grant that the execution is over. He assures Grant that Jefferson was the bravest man in the room that morning. Grant looks out over the town, numb and heavyhearted, and discovers that he is crying."
Emanates,"The story starts with Alina Starkov and Malyev “Mal” Oretsev, two young orphans living in a Duke’s house in Karemzin. They are being tested by Grisha Examiners who aim to find out if they’re capable of using the Small Science, a system of magic-like abilities. The two orphans hold onto each other tightly, hoping not to be split up by the judgment of the Examiners.  
Years later, Alina and Mal are adults in the same regiment of the First Army of Ravka. The regiment has been tasked with crossing the Shadow Fold, an expanse of blackness that divides the country of Ravka in half. The Fold plays host to the volcra, monsters who feed on people and fear the light. During the crossing their sandskiff is attacked by volcra, resulting in numerous casualties. But when they attack Mal, magic is awakened inside Alina and light emanates from her. She scares the monsters away.  
When the skiff returns to the drydock, Alina is brought before the Darkling, a powerful Grisha who leads the Second Army. The Darkling tests her for power and finds that she is capable of manipulating light. Knowing that he has finally found the Sun Summoner, the only Grisha with the capability to affect the Fold, the Darkling sends Alina to the capital with a retinue of guards for protection. The Darkling tells her she may be able to destroy the Fold for good. Her carriage is attacked by Fjerdan assassins, and Alina only survives because the Darkling arrives just in time to save her.  
Upon her arrival at the Little Palace in Os Alta, the capital, Alina meets the King and Queen of Ravka and her presence brings hope to the war-torn country for the first time in many years. She befriends Genya, a Grisha woman who teaches Alina the ins-and-outs of Grisha life. Alina begins her training by researching Grisha history and theory, learning martial arts from a former mercenary named Botkin, and attempting to use her power with the help of an ancient Grisha woman named Baghra. At first, Alina is only able to use her power with the help of either the Darkling or Baghra, who act as amplifiers for other Grisha.   
Alina sends letters to Mal but receives no response for months. The lack of correspondence makes her feel alienated from Mal and she begins to believe that their relationship has crumbled. As a result, she realizes it was her love for Mal that made her hide her power since childhood. It’s only then that Alina can use her power without assistance. The Darkling and Baghra agree that she’s not powerful enough on her own to be able to manipulate the Fold, so the Darkling makes plans to find her an amplifier. He plans on making an amplifier from the horns of a legendary Morozovan stag which Baghra insists does not exist. One winter night, the Darkling surprises Alina by kissing her. 
The Darkling insists that Alina focus on honing her magic while he has his men search for the stag. On the night of the King’s winter fete, Alina participates in a demonstration of her power with the Darkling. Afterward, the Darkling and Alina escape to a secluded room and kiss passionately. Alina feels overwhelmed by the Darkling’s power, but she senses something strange about his actions. Soon, the Darkling leaves to follow up on a report about the stag. On her way back to her dormitory, Alina sees Mal walking through the hallway. Mal has been tracking the stag for the Darkling and has not received any of Alina’s letters. The two have a heated argument and part on bad terms.  
Alina is surprised later that night when Baghra arrives at her room and insists that she leave the capital. Baghra reveals that the Darkling is intending to use the stag’s antlers to control her power and expand the Fold instead of shrinking it. She also divulges that she is the Darkling’s mother and that the Darkling is the Black Heretic, the figure that created the Fold centuries ago. Convinced of the Darkling’s evil, Alina leaves Os Alta, hiding among performers departing the palace. She heads west and keeps herself as inconspicuous as possible. But Alina is forced to use her powers to defend herself which reveals who she is to nearby soldiers. Alina flees from the Darkling’s men into the forest, but they pursue her. Alina avoids them for some time before Mal rescues her and leads her to safety.  
When Alina reveals the Darkling’s plan to him, the pair formulates a plan to get to the stag before the Darkling, relying on Mal’s skills as a tracker. They search for the stag, travelling far north. Their journey is a hard one, punctuated by freezing temperatures, difficult terrain, and dangerous interactions with people on the road. One night Mal confesses his longtime feelings for Alina and they kiss. Then, Morozova’s herd wanders close to their camp. But rather than killing the stag, Alina chooses to spare its life. She is determined to find another way to defeat the Darkling. Just then, the Darkling’s men emerge from the woods in ambush. The Darkling takes the pair prisoner and kills the stag. He has the antlers permanently fastened around Alina’s neck and seizes control of her power.  
The Darkling takes Alina and Mal to the Shadow Fold, along with emissaries from the surrounding countries. Then he uses Alina’s powers to illuminate a wide path through the Fold, sending the volcra reeling away. The Darkling suddenly extends the Fold, which swallows up the village of Novokribirsk, as a demonstration of his power. He threatens to use the Fold as a weapon against any country that opposes him.  
As a final act of cruelty, the Darkling orders Mal to be thrown to the volcra. Horrified and furious, Alina tries to resist the Darkling’s power and keep Mal safe, but she’s unable to gain control. But as the darkness closes in on Mal, Alina has an epiphany. By showing the stag mercy and sparing its life, she has just as much power over the amplifier as the man who killed the stag. Alina suddenly regains control over her power and saves Mal. Though she tries to turn the other Grisha against the Darkling, none of them comply. She uses the powerful Grisha ability known as the Cut to first destroy the skiff’s masts and then to tear the entire skiff in half. Alina and Mal leave the Fold behind. They are unsure whether the Darkling has survived. They flee into the west and cross the True Sea to escape."
Conventions,"The Bottom is a mostly Black community in Ohio, situated in the hills above the mostly white, wealthier community of Medallion. The Bottom first became a community when a master gave it to his former slave. This ""gift"" was in fact a trick: the master gave the former slave a poor stretch of hilly land, convincing the slave the land was worthwhile by claiming that because it was hilly, it was closer to heaven. The trick, though, led to the growth of a vibrant community. Now the community faces a new threat; wealthy whites have taken a liking to the land, and would like to destroy much of the town in order to build a golf course.
Shadrack, a resident of the Bottom, fought in WWI. He returns a shattered man, unable to accept the complexities of the world; he lives on the outskirts of town, attempting to create order in his life. One of his methods involves compartmentalizing his fear of death in a ritual he invents and names National Suicide Day. The town is at first wary of him and his ritual, then, over time, unthinkingly accepts him.
Meanwhile, the families of the children Nel and Sula are contrasted. Nel is the product of a family that believes deeply in social conventions; hers is a stable home, though some might characterize it as rigid. Nel is uncertain of the conventional life her mother, Helene, wants for her; these doubts are hammered home when she meets Rochelle, her grandmother and a former prostitute, the only unconventional woman in her family line. Sula's family is very different: she lives with her grandmother, Eva, and her mother, Hannah, both of whom are seen by the town as eccentric and loose. Their house also serves as a home for three informally adopted boys and a steady stream of borders.
Despite their differences, Sula and Nel become fiercely attached to each other during adolescence. However, a traumatic accident changes everything. One day, Sula playfully swings a neighborhood boy, Chicken Little, around by his hands. When she loses her grip, the boy falls into a nearby river and drowns. They never tell anyone about the accident even though they did not intend to harm the boy. The two girls begin to grow apart. One day, in an accident, Sula's mother's dress catches fire and she dies of the burns.
After high school, Nel chooses to marry and settles into the conventional role of wife and mother. Sula follows a wildly divergent path and lives a life of fierce independence and total disregard for social conventions. Shortly after Nel's wedding, Sula leaves the Bottom for a period of 10 years. She has many affairs, some with white men. However, she finds people following the same boring routines elsewhere, so she returns to the Bottom and to Nel.
Upon her return, the town regards Sula as the very personification of evil for her blatant disregard of social conventions. Their hatred in part rests upon Sula's interracial relationships, but is crystallized when Sula has an affair with Nel's husband, Jude, who subsequently abandons Nel. Ironically, the community's labeling of Sula as evil actually improves their own lives. Her presence in the community gives them the impetus to live harmoniously with one another. Nel breaks off her friendship with Sula. Just before Sula dies in 1940, they achieve a half-hearted reconciliation. With Sula's death, the harmony that had reigned in the town quickly dissolves.
In 1965, with the Bottom facing the prospect of the white golf course, Nel visits Eva in the nursing home. Eva accuses her of sharing the guilt for Chicken Little's death. Her accusation forces Nel to confront the unfairness of her judgment against Sula. Nel admits to herself that she had blamed his death entirely on Sula and set herself up as the ""good"" half of the relationship. Nel comes to realize that in the aftermath of Chicken Little's death she had too quickly clung to social convention in an effort to define herself as ""good."" Nel goes to the cemetery and mourns at Sula's grave, calling out Sula's name in sadness.
Sula is a novel about ambiguity. It questions and examines the terms ""good"" and ""evil,"" often demonstrating that the two often resemble one another. The novel addresses the confusing mysteries of human emotions and relationships, ultimately concluding that social conventions are inadequate as a foundation for living one's life. The novel tempts the reader to apply the diametrically opposed terms of ""good and evil,"" ""right and wrong"" to the characters and their actions, and yet simultaneously shows why it is necessary to resist such temptation. While exploring the ways in which people try to make meaning of lives filled with conflicts over race, gender, and simple idiosyncratic points of views, Sula resists easy answers, demonstrating the ambiguity, beauty, and terror of life, in both its triumphs and horrors."
Pain,"In Common Sense, Thomas Paine argues for American independence. His argument begins with more general, theoretical reflections about government and religion, then progresses onto the specifics of the colonial situation.
Paine begins by distinguishing between government and society. Society, according to Paine, is everything constructive and good that people join together to accomplish. Government, on the other hand, is an institution whose sole purpose is to protect us from our own vices. Government has its origins in the evil of man and is therefore a necessary evil at best. Paine says that government's sole purpose is to protect life, liberty and property, and that a government should be judged solely on the basis of the extent to which it accomplishes this goal.
Paine then considers an imagined scenario in which a small group of people has been placed on an island, and cut off from the rest of society. In time, these people develop ties with one another, and lawmaking becomes inevitable. Paine says the people will be much happier if they are responsible for the creation of the laws that rule them. Paine is also implicitly arguing that such a system of representation is also better for the American colonists. Having expressed his disagreement with British reign in America, Paine proceeds to launch a general attack on the British system of government. Paine says the British system is too complex and rife with contradictions, and that the monarchy is granted far too much power. The British system pretends to offer a reasonable system of checks and balances, but in fact, it does not.
From here Paine moves on to discuss, in general, the notions of monarchy and hereditary succession. Man, Pain argues, was born into a state of equality, and the distinction that has arisen between king and subject is an unnatural one. At first, Paine says, the world was without kings, but the ancient Jews decided they wanted a king. This angered God, but he allowed them to have one. Paine presents pages of biblical evidence detailing God's wrath at the idea of the Jews having a king. The conclusion Paine reaches is that the practice of monarchy originates from sin, and is an institution that the Bible and God condemn. Paine calls hereditary succession an abominable practice. He says that even if people were to choose to have a king, that does not legitimize that King's child acting as a future ruler. Furthermore, hereditary succession has brought with it innumerable evils, such as incompetent kings, corruption, and civil war.
Having dispensed with the preliminary theoretical issues, Paine sets in to discuss the details of the American situation. In response to the argument that America has flourished under British rule, and therefore ought to stay under the king, Paine says that such an argument fails to realize that America has evolved and no longer needs Britain's help. Some say that Britain has protected America, and therefore deserves allegiance, but Paine responds that Britain has only watched over America in order to secure its own economic well-being. Paine adds that most recently, instead of watching over the colonies, the British have been attacking them, and are therefore undeserving of American loyalty.
Paine says that the colonies have little to gain from remaining attached to Britain. Commerce can be better conducted with the rest of Europe, but only after America becomes independent. Paine also asserts that if the colonies remain attached to Britain, the same problems that have arisen in the past will arise in the future. Paine argues that it is necessary to seek independence now, as to do otherwise would only briefly cover up problems that will surely reemerge.
Paine even proposes the form of government that the independent colonies should adopt. His recommendation is for a representative democracy that gives roughly equal weight to each of the colonies.
Paine explains why the current time is a good time to break free of Britain. Primarily, Paine focuses on the present size of the colonies, and on their current capabilities. He presents an inventory of the British Navy and gives calculations revealing how America could build a navy of comparable size. Paine recommends this as a way of ensuring America's security and prosperity in trade. Paine also argues that America is sufficiently small as to be united now. If time were to elapse, and the population of the colonies to grow, the same feeling of unity would not be present. Paine adds that if the Americans revolt now, they can use the vast expanses of uncharted land to the West in order to pay down some of the debt they will incur.
Paine says that as a colony of Britain, America lacks respectability on the international scene. They are seen simply as rebels, and cannot form substantial alliances with other nations. In order to prosper in the long term, the colonies need to be independent. Paine says that, by declaring independence, America will be able to ask for the help of other countries in its struggle for freedom. For all of these reasons, Paine says it is imperative and urgent that the colonies declare independence."
These,"There There is a collection of stories about different people who are all traveling to the Big Oakland Powwow in California. Each chapter follows a different character, describing their history and explaining why they are going to the powwow. Each of the characters is Native American, but not all of them embrace their heritage.
Tony Loneman, twenty-one years old, was born with fetal alcohol syndrome. While he grew up believing he was not intelligent, he has natural street smarts. When he looks in the mirror, Tony sees what he calls “the Drome”: the facial features associated with fetal alcohol syndrome. Tony lives with his grandmother and has been selling drugs since he was thirteen. His drug supplier, Octavio, shows him a 3-D printed gun and tells him that they are going to rob the Big Oakland Powwow at the Oakland Coliseum.
Dene Oxendene lives in Oakland and is a young, motivated artist. He obtains a grant to make a storytelling documentary in which Native people share their perspectives on living in Oakland. He inherited both his camera and his interest in moviemaking from his late uncle. Dene plans to set up a storytelling booth at the powwow.
Opal Viola Victoria Bear Shield and her sister, Jacquie Red Feather, were children when their mother took them to Alcatraz Island in 1970 as part of Native American protests. Opal mostly spent time with her mother there, while Jacquie spent time with a group of teenagers. Before leaving the island, Jacquie was raped by another teen named Harvey. She became pregnant and put the baby girl up for adoption. When Opal and Jacquie’s mother died, they entered the foster care system. Jacquie had another daughter, Jamie, who went on to have three boys: Orvil, Loother, and Lony. Jamie was a heroin addict and eventually killed herself. Since Jacquie was still battling alcohol addiction, Opal adopted Jacquie’s three grandsons. While raising the boys, Opal has taught them that they are not to engage in any Native activities. 
Orvil Red Feather, the oldest of Jacquie’s grandsons, watches footage of powwows on the internet. Feeling a connection to the dancers, he finds a set of Native regalia in Opal’s closet and practices dancing. He takes his brothers to the Big Oakland Powwow without telling Opal, hoping that he can win prize money by dancing. Opal goes to the powwow to watch, careful not to let the boys know that she is attending.
Jacquie Red Feather lives in New Mexico, where she works as an addiction counselor but still struggles with alcoholism herself. She has never actually met her grandsons. When she runs into Harvey at an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, she confronts him about their past. Harvey has just learned that he has a son in Oakland named Edwin, and Jacquie tells him that they have a daughter, the one she put up for adoption. Jacquie agrees to ride with Harvey to Oakland, even though she has a difficult time forgiving him.
Harvey’s son, Edwin Black, still lives with his mother, even though he is in his thirties. His mother helps him get a paid internship at the Indian Center where he helps organize the Big Oakland Powwow. Her boyfriend, Bill Davis, works as part of the maintenance crew for the Oakland Coliseum, where the powwow will be held.
Blue is Jacquie’s first daughter, who was put up for adoption. She was raised in Oakland but later moved to Oklahoma. Stuck in an abusive marriage, Blue escaped Oklahoma and moved back to Oakland. She has been working at the Indian Center in Oakland for a year. She and Edwin plan the Big Oakland Powwow.
Calvin Johnson lives with his sister in Oakland. He and his brother Charles work for Octavio, Tony’s supplier, selling drugs. Calvin owes Octavio money and has been avoiding him. Charles and his crime partner, Carlos, take Calvin to Octavio to sort out the issue. Octavio tells the group that they are going to rob the Big Oakland Powwow with 3-D printed guns that can get through the security checkpoint. Because Calvin works at the Indian Center, he is afraid that he will be recognized.
Thomas Frank goes to the powwow to drum and sing for the dancers. He has recently been fired from the Indian Center, but drumming gives him a sense of belonging.
On the day of the powwow, Blue and Edwin arrive early to set up the field. Dene Oxendene sets up his storytelling booth, hoping to film interviews with people and ask what the powwow experience means to them. Harvey is the powwow emcee, and Jacquie sits with him in the tent with all of the sound equipment. Edwin and Blue walk over and meet Harvey and Jacquie. Harvey embraces Edwin, recognizing that he is his son. Blue thinks that Jacquie might be her mother and is in shock (she does not realize that Harvey is her father). Jacquie sees Orvil’s name on the list of men who will be dancing.
Orvil and his brothers, Loother and Lony, ride their bikes to the powwow. Orvil puts on the regalia that he took from Opal’s closet and dances out during the Grand Entry. Up in the stands, Opal watches his performance.
Entering the Coliseum with their 3-D printed guns, Calvin, Octavio, Charles, Carlos, and Tony approach the table where Edwin and Blue are sitting. Tony is supposed to do the actual holdup while the others keep watch, but he changes his mind. In his place, Octavio approaches the table and points his gun at Edwin and Blue, demanding the money. After Octavio has the money (in the form of Visa gift cards), Charles and Carlos try to rob him. Octavio shoots at Charles but then is killed by Carlos. Calvin dies in the crossfire. Tony, seeing that many innocent people are also caught in the crossfire, shoots Carlos and then tackles Charles. Tony kills Charles but is hit many times and also dies. 
Thomas, Orvil, and Edwin are among the people caught in the crossfire. Thomas dies. Blue takes Edwin to the hospital while Opal, Harvey, and Jacquie take Orvil to the hospital.  Both boys are admitted at the emergency room, but their fate is unclear."
Chosen,"The Chosen traces a friendship between two Jewish boys growing up in Brooklyn at the end of World War II. Reuven Malter, the narrator and one of the novel’s two protagonists, is a traditional Orthodox Jew. He is the son of David Malter, a dedicated scholar and humanitarian. Danny Saunders, the other protagonist, is a brilliant Hasid with a photographic memory and a passion for psychoanalysis. Danny is the son of Reb Saunders, the pious and revered head of a great Hasidic dynasty. Over the course of eighteen chapters (divided into three books), the novel tells the story of the friendship that develops between the two boys, and it examines the tensions that arise as their cultures collide with each other and with modern American society.
	In Book One, Reuven’s high school softball team plays against Danny’s yeshiva team in a Sunday game. Tension quickly develops as the Hasidic team insults the faith of Reuven and his teammates. The game becomes a kind of holy war for both teams, and the resulting competition is fierce. In the final inning, Reuven is pitching. Danny smacks a line drive at Reuven that hits him in the eye, shattering his glasses and nearly blinding him. Reuven is rushed to the hospital, where he spends a week recuperating. While in the hospital, he becomes friendly with two fellow patients: Tony Savo, an ex-boxer, and Billy Merrit, a young blind boy. 
Danny visits Reuven in the hospital to ask his forgiveness, and a tenuous friendship begins. Tentatively, the two boys begin talking about their intellectual interests and their hopes for the future. Danny reveals that he has an astounding intellect, including a photographic memory, and he displays a prodigious knowledge of the Talmud. Danny also confides that he secretly reads every day in the public library, studying books of which his father would disapprove. He also says that a nice older man often recommends books to him. Both boys are surprised to discover that David Malter—Reuven’s father—is this man.
	Book Two focuses on the rest of Reuven and Danny’s time in high school. Reuven begins spending Shabbat afternoons at Danny’s house. On their first Sabbath together, Danny introduces Reuven to his father, Rabbi Isaac Saunders. Reuven witnesses a strange ritual: Reb Saunders quizzes Danny in public during their congregation’s Sabbath meal. Reb Saunders also surprises Reuven, asking him a question about the speech Reb Saunders gave. Reuven answers correctly, impressing Reb Saunders. 
Danny and Reuven begin spending most afternoons together in the library and Saturdays studying Talmud with Reb Saunders. Reuven learns that Reb Saunders believes in raising his son in silence. Except for discussions of Talmud, Danny’s father never speaks to him directly, though he begins to use Reuven as an indirect means of talking to his son. Outside of the shul, Danny and Reuven spend almost all their free time together and have many conversations.
	Meanwhile, almost everyone is obsessed with news about World War II. President Roosevelt’s death in April 1945 saddens the entire country. In May, Reuven and his father celebrate the end of the war in Europe, but are shocked by the discovery of concentration camps behind enemy lines. Everyone, even Reb Saunders, is disturbed by the reports of Jewish suffering and death at the hands of the Nazis. 
After Reuven’s finals that spring, his father suffers a heart attack, and Reuven goes to live with the Saunders family for the summer. While there, Danny and Reuven talk a great deal, and Reuven learns that Danny plans to study Freudian psychoanalysis instead of inheriting his father’s position in the Hasidic community. Danny hopes that his younger brother Levi can succeed his father in his place. In the fall, both boys begin studying at Hirsch College in Brooklyn.
	Book Three chronicles the experiences of Reuven and Danny at Samson Raphael Hirsch Seminary and College. Danny immediately becomes a leader of the Hasidic student body, but he is disappointed by the college’s emphasis on experimental, rather than Freudian, psychology. Meanwhile, Reuven decides that he is firmly committed to becoming a rabbi. Reuven is also worried about his father, whose health is rapidly deteriorating in part due to his frenetic Zionist activity. In school, Danny continues to be frustrated by the psychology curriculum, but Reuven convinces Danny to discuss his differences with his psychology professor, and the resulting conversation is very productive for Danny. With the help of Reuven’s tutelage in mathematics, Danny comes to appreciate the value of the experimental method.
	As the conflicts over a Jewish state become more intense, tensions swell among the various student factions at the college. After David Malter gives a highly publicized pro-Zionist speech at Madison Square Garden, Reb Saunders, who is staunchly anti-Zionist, forbids Danny from speaking to Reuven. The silence between the two boys continues into their second year at college. They both take Rav Gershenson’s Talmud class, which allows them to interact indirectly. Yet Reuven misses Danny’s friendship terribly, especially after Reuven’s father suffers a second heart attack. As David Malter recovers, Reuven rigorously studies the Talmud and dazzles the entire class—including Danny—with one particularly brilliant classroom display of knowledge. After Reuven’s father returns from the hospital, the college is staggered by the news that an alumnus of Hirsch died in the fighting in Israel. Finally, during Reuven and Danny’s third year of college, after the United Nations officially declares the creation of the State of Israel and after it becomes clear that Israel will triumph in its battles against the Arabs, Reb Saunders relents and allows the two boys to speak to each other again.
Danny and Reuven quickly resume their intense friendship. Over the summer, Reuven returns to Danny’s shul, goes to Danny’s sister’s wedding, and sees Reb Saunders again. Reuven still harbors anger toward Danny’s father, and ignores the older man’s invitation to a Sabbath Talmud discussion. During the boys’ final year at college, Reuven sees Reb Saunders while attending Danny’s brother’s Bar Mitzvah, and again the rabbi invites Reuven over. Reuven ignores the request. 
Meanwhile, Danny secretly applies to graduate programs in psychology, but soon realizes that his father will inevitably see letters from the schools in the family’s mailbox. One night, after a discussion with his father, Reuven realizes that Reb Saunders is asking him to come over so he can indirectly talk to Danny. Reuven goes to their house, and Reb Saunders, using Reuven as a buffer to speak to Danny, finally explains why he raised Danny in silence. He says he always knew his son had a great mind, but was worried that his soul was empty, unable to empathize with the suffering of others. Silence was a way to make Danny explore his own soul and feel the suffering of the world. Reb Saunders further reveals that he is aware of Danny’s plan to become a psychologist instead of a rabbi. He apologizes to Reuven for separating the two boys, and he apologizes to Danny for raising him in silence. At the same time, he says he saw no other way to raise Danny to become a true tzaddik—a tzaddik for the world, not only a tzaddik for his congregation. Later, in front of his congregation, he gives his blessing to Danny and the life he has chosen for himself. Danny shaves his beard and earlocks, and enrolls in a graduate program at Columbia University."
Where,"The body of Chase Andrews is found by two boys next to an abandoned fire tower in the swamp on October 30, 1969.
In 1952, six-year-old Kya watches her mother leave their shack in the marsh. Before long, her siblings, including her beloved 12-year-old brother Jodie, depart too, leaving Kya alone with Pa, a drunken, disabled World War II vet prone to violent rages. Pa gives Kya a dollar a week for food. In town, older boys, including Chase Andrews, pass her on their bikes. Kya spends most of her time in the marsh with the gulls.
Mrs. Culpepper, a truant officer, takes Kya to school, where she is humiliated and never returns. Over the years, townspeople call her “dirty,” “the Marsh Girl,” “Missing Link,” and “marsh trash.”
Kya takes Pa’s fishing boat exploring. When she gets lost, one of Jodie’s friends, Tate Walker, guides her back to her channel. Tate lives alone in town with his dad, Scupper, a fisherman. 
For a while, Kya and Pa fish together and enjoy each other’s company. Pa introduces Kya to Jumpin’, an older Black man who sells gas and supplies. Kya’s mother sends a letter, but Pa burns it and returns to drinking. Pa finally disappears when Kya is ten years old. Kya supports herself selling mussels to Jumpin’, whose wife Mabel collects clothes for Kya from Colored Town. Kya continues watching Tate as well as Chase and his friends.
When she is 14 years old, Kya finds a series of special feathers left in a tree stump in the marsh. One day, she leaves a special feather in return. After that, Tate appears at the stump and offers to teach her to read. Tate and Kya begin to meet at a secret cabin in the marsh where he teaches her to read. As Kya matures, Tate brings her a biology textbook and Mabel gives her a bra. One day Tate finds Kya sick on Point Beach. He explains to her that she is having her period. Kya and Tate continue their lessons and she invites him inside her shack and shows him her collection of natural objects. One day, Tate kisses Kya and they begin a romantic relationship. Their desire grows but they avoid having sex. Tate leaves early for college and tells Kya he will visit on the 4th of July. However, he doesn’t return. Kya, devastated, returns to studying nature.
When Kya is 19 years old, Chase catches her eye on Point Beach. He is a popular, good looking, confident, former high school quarterback. Chase approaches Kya on Jumpin’s wharf and invites her on a picnic. 
At the picnic, Chase gives Kya a rare scallop shell. He is sexually aggressive and she runs away. When Kya and Chase meet ten days later, he apologizes and takes her to see the abandoned fire tower. Kya gives Chase a necklace made from the scallop shell. Chase says he won’t approach her sexually unless she wants him to.
Kya gets closer to Chase. Tate, who is home from college, wants to apologize to Kya, but sees her kissing Chase and turns away. Chase starts talking about marriage and invites Kya on an overnight trip. She joins him and they have unsatisfying sex in a cheap motel room. Still, their relationship continues. However, Chase won’t introduce Kya to his parents or friends and disappears for a week over Christmas. 
Tate comes to the lagoon to warn Kya that Chase is seeing other women, but she throws rocks at him. Still, she invites him into the shack and he offers to find a publisher for a book of her nature paintings. 
Kya sees the engagement announcement in the newspaper for Chase and Pearl, a girl she recognizes from Point Beach. She recites poems by Amanda Hamilton, who publishes in the local newspaper, to soothe herself. She determines to live her life alone.
A year later, Kya receives a copy of her first book. She uses the advance money to improve and modernize the shack. She gives Tate a copy of her book. 
Kya’s brother Jodie visits the shack. He tells her that Ma has died and promises to keep in touch. He encourages her to reconcile with Tate.
In August of 1969, Chase sneaks up on Kya on a remote beach, attacks and tries to rape her. She fights him off and sees two fishermen watching from their boat as she leaves. Tate and Jumpin’ see her bruises, but she begs them not to tell anyone. Chase continues to come to her shack, but she hides from him. Kya gets a letter from her publisher, Robert Foster, to meet him in Greenville. She finds out from Tate how to buy a bus ticket and goes to meet him on October 28, returning on October 30, the day Chase’s body is found.
Sheriff Ed Jackson and his deputy Joe Perdue investigate Chase’s death. No footprints or fingerprints are found at the scene. They think Chase was pushed through an open gate and the murderer covered up the scene. Almost immediately, everyone in town suspects “the Marsh Girl.” 
Over time, Joe and Ed’s main clue consists of red wool fibers on Chase’s jacket. Also, Chase’s mother Patti Love tells them Chase was wearing the shell necklace when he left her house that night, but it was not found at the scene. A shrimper, Hal Miller, tells them he saw Kya’s boat headed toward the fire tower the night Chase died. However, Tate and Jumpin’ and townspeople who saw her get on and off the bus to Greenville give Kya an alibi. A fisherman, Rodney Horn, who heard Kya yelling and saw her leaving after Chase attacked her, heard her say she would kill Chase if he bothered her again. Joe and Ed find a red wool hat in Kya’s shack that Tate gave her and that matches the fibers on Chase’s coat. With this information, they arrest Kya for murder.
Kya spends two months in jail awaiting trial. A lawyer, Tom Milton, volunteers to defend her. 
A kind guard at the prison, Jacob, lets the cat, Sunday Justice, into her cell for company. Tate, Jumpin’, and Mabel sit behind Kya in court for support. They are later joined by Jodie, Robert Foster, and Scupper. 
Prosecutor Eric Chastain calls his witnesses and Tom Milton counters their testimony. The jury learns that it would have been possible for Kya to take buses back and forth from Greenville on the night of the murder, but the timing is very tight. Tom calls defense witnesses, including Kya’s publisher Robert Foster. After closing statements, everyone awaits the verdict. Kya is found not guilty. Jodie takes her home, where she is delighted to see the marsh again. 
Kya sees Tate in his boat and is going to approach him, but the sheriff and two deputies arrive and take Tate with them. She learns that Scupper has had a stroke and died.
The day after Scupper’s funeral, Tate finds a feather in his boat from Kya. At the shack, they express their love for each other and Tate moves in with her. Over the years, Jumpin’ dies, and Jodie and his wife and children visit the shack. Tate works at the nearby lab and Kya writes seven more books. 
One day Tate finds Kya in her boat, dead of a heart attack at age 64. On her tombstone, he inscribes “The Marsh Girl.” Many townspeople come to Kya’s funeral on her land. That night, Tate finds two items beneath the floorboards. One is a box of poems by Amanda Hamilton, a pseudonym Kya used, including a poem describing Chase Andrews’ death. Tate also finds the shell necklace Kya gave Chase. Tate burns the poems and rawhide cord and crushes the shell on the beach for the tide to take away."
Mystery,"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time takes place in the year 1998 in and around the town of Swindon, England. The fifteen-year-old narrator of the story, Christopher John Francis Boone, discovers the slain body of his neighbor’s poodle, Wellington, on the neighbor’s front lawn one evening and sets out to uncover the murderer. His investigation is at times aided, and at other times hampered, by the mild form of autism he lives with. After Christopher hits a policeman in a misunderstanding at the scene of the crime, the police take Christopher into custody. They release Christopher with only a stern warning, under the condition that he promises to them and to his father not to look into the murder any further.
Christopher chronicles his investigation in a book—the book we are reading—as part of a school assignment. Ignoring repeated warnings from his father, Christopher investigates the crime scene and conducts interviews with the residents of his block. He uncovers a more tangled plot than was first apparent when he discovers that his father and the owner of the slain dog, Mrs. Shears, had a romantic affair. He subsequently learns that their affair began in reaction to another relationship, one carried on between Mr. Shears and Christopher’s mother, before she disappeared from Christopher’s life.
At school, Christopher prepares for an A-level math exam that will enable him to attend a university, a feat no other child at his school has managed. He also continues to work on his book. Upon returning home one afternoon, Christopher accidentally leaves his book in plain view on the kitchen table. His father reads it, becomes angry, and confiscates it. Later, Christopher searches for the book and uncovers a series of letters, hidden in a shirt box in his father’s closet, addressed to him from his supposedly dead mother. The letters chronicle a life that his mother has continued to lead with Mr. Shears in London and contain repeated requests for Christopher to respond. In shock, Christopher passes out in his bedroom surrounded by the evidence of his father’s deception. When Father comes home and realizes what has happened, he breaks down in tears. He apologizes for his lies, explaining that he acted out of a desire to protect Christopher from the knowledge of his mother’s abandonment of the family. Christopher’s father also admits to killing Wellington after an argument with Mrs. Shears, his lover.
Christopher, now terrified of his father and feeling he can no longer trust him, sneaks out of the house and travels to London to live with his mother. During a harrowing journey, he copes with and overcomes the social fears and limitations of his condition, dodges police, and almost gets hit by a train. His arrival at his mother’s flat comes as a total surprise to her, as she had no idea that Christopher’s father had been withholding her letters. Christopher settles in for a time at his mother and Mr. Shears’s flat, but friction caused by his presence shortly results in his mother’s decision to leave Mr. Shears to return to Swindon. Christopher moves into a new apartment with his mother and begins to receive regular visits from his father. When Christopher’s pet rat Toby dies, Christopher’s father gives Christopher a puppy. At school, Christopher sits for his A-level math exam and receives an A grade, the best possible score. The novel ends with Christopher planning to take more A-level exams in physics and further math, and then attend a university in another town. He knows that he can do all of this because he solved the mystery of Wellington’s murder, was brave enough to find his mother, and wrote the book that we have read."
Financing,"Educated is primarily retrospective, consisting of Tara Westover's memories about her past. She tells the story of the events of her life from a vantage point in her late twenties, occasionally interjecting to comment on the process of trying to arrive at an accurate version of the past. Tara was born the youngest of seven children to parents whom she refers to as Faye and Gene (pseudonyms). The Westover family lived on a farm in rural Idaho, where Gene made a living salvaging scrap metal while Faye worked as an unlicensed midwife and herbal healer. Gene suffered from paranoid fears about interference from the federal government, and as a result he refused to allow his children to attend school, receive birth certificates, or receive medical attention. Gene was also a devout Mormon who believed in radical self-sufficiency and an impending Day of Judgement.
		
Shifts in the Westover family dynamic began to emerge when Tara was about nine. Her mother's work as a midwife increased her sense of independence, but after sustaining a serious and untreated brain injury in a car accident, Faye began to lose confidence in her skills, and focused instead on using herbal remedies and a form of intuitive healing. Around this time, Tyler (the third son) announced that he was going to attend college, which estranged him from his family. Tyler's absence forced Tara to become more involved in helping her father with his scrapping work, which left her constantly exposed to the possibility of dangerous injury. It also made her more curious about possibly pursuing an education herself. When Tara was ten, she told her disapproving father that she wanted to begin going to school, but nothing came of the idea.
As Tara grew into her teens, she acquired more independence from her family due to taking on various jobs and pursuing singing and musical theatre in the local community. However, her life was dominated by the strict rules and religious doctrine her father imposed, and Tara often worried about becoming sinful. When Tara was thirteen, her older brother Shawn moved back home. At first Shawn and Tara were close and spent a lot of time together. When Tara was about fifteen, however, Shawn began to be physically abusive toward her. His behavior only got worse after Shawn experienced a head injury. Tyler eventually realized that Shawn was hurting Tara, and he urged Tara to seriously consider applying to college and getting away from the family. Although she was uncertain at first, Tara began to study and was eventually accepted at Brigham Young University, having passed herself off as homeschooled.
In January 2004, when Tara was seventeen years old, she moved to Utah to begin her college education. She found the adjustment very difficult at first, but eventually began to excel in her studies. Tara's finances were precarious, and she had to hold multiple jobs and maintain very high grades to retain her scholarship. Her emerging independence also caused a threatening dynamic between her, Gene, and Shawn. Whenever Tara returned to Buck's Peak, her father manipulated her into working for him, while Shawn continued to physically and emotionally abuse her. Tara eventually confided to a bishop about her life, and he helped her to secure funding to finance her education. Tara's studies, and the people she met, also gradually opened her eyes to different realities and force her to realize how damaging and isolating her childhood has been. Tara eventually changed her major to studying history, and is encouraged to apply for a study abroad program at Cambridge University in England.
Tara's experience at Cambridge broadened her horizons even further, and she was encouraged to consider graduate studies. Tara still felt isolated from her peers, and ashamed of her origins. She hid most of her past even from her friends and the men she occasionally dated. She was eventually awarded a prestigious Cambridge Gates Fellowship and moved to England to pursue a Master's degree. She remained in close contact with her family and returned to Idaho regularly to visit, but her relationship with them deteriorated. Shawn was growing increasingly erratic and violent, and Tara feared for the safety of his wife and young child. By chance, she revealed to her sister Audrey that Shawn had been abusive with her, and Audrey later confided that Shawn abused her as well. Audrey blamed herself for not protecting her younger sister, and suggested that she and Tara confront their parents and Shawn about what happened to them.
By then Tara had built a happy life for herself in England, and was working on a PhD in history at Cambridge. However, the attempt to speak the truth quickly became a source of conflict in the family. Tara became more and more ostracized within her family, eventually culminating in Shawn learning that she had been telling their parents about the abuse she suffered. Realizing her family would never trust her claims, Tara became estranged from most of them, with the exception of Tyler.  The estrangement from her family prompted grief and depression for Tara, but she was finally able to heal, and successfully completed her PhD. By the end of her memoir, Tara has accepted that she may never have a relationship with her family again, but she takes pride in the independence she has established, and the life she has built for herself."
Pursue,"Marjane “Marji” Satrapi is an intelligent, spirited, and very modern girl living with her parents in Iran’s capital of Tehran during the eventful period of Iranian history from the late 1970s into the early 1980s. In Persepolis: The Story of a Childhood, Marji’s remembers her life during those years, mostly from when she was about ten to age fourteen. This account includes how Marji and her family lived through and were affected by turbulent events that included the overthrow of the autocratic Shah of Iran by the Islamic revolution, the oppressive fundamentalist regime that replaced the Shah, and the devasting Iran-Iraq war.
The nation’s wealth has long made it a target of outside invaders, but Islamic revolution of 1979 has pushed out the Western-backed government of the Shah.  The revolution has ushered in a new Islamic regime that is bringing massive societal changes impacting how people are supposed to behave--including Marji and her family. Marji struggles to adjust to the changes at her liberal French bilingual school, which has become increasingly stricter. Girls are required to wear veils and female and male students are now separated. Marji’s wealthy and modern parents—her father, Ebi, and her mother, Taji—take part in the massive protests against the new regime’s strict rules on behavior (just as they had previously protested against the Shah’s regime). Marji’s parents worry when a photo of Marji’s mother a protest appears in newspapers magazines. Later, after a demonstration they are at turns violent, the Satrapis decide that openly protesting is too dangerous to continue to do.
Marji feels conflict between her own deeply spiritual feelings and the stark modernism of her parents. She talks to God at night and has believed she will become a prophet one day since she was six years old, Marji. But the revolution leads to Marji setting aside these ambitions while she studies and imitates protestors and revolutionaries. She mimics protestors in the garden of her house and studies books about famous revolutionaries and philosophers given to her by her parents. She fantasizes about becoming a hero and wants her parents to become heroes too. Marji’s relationship with God becomes strained, as she finds that she and God have less to talk about—although God does still come by to see her from time to time.
Marji thrills when she learns that rebels fill her family history. She learns that her grandfather was a prince and later a communist whom the Shah removed from power and that her uncle Anoosh, also a communist, spent nine years in prison during the Shah’s regime. Marji spends a short time with Anoosh, learning about his life. After the Shah fell from power in 1979, Anoosh was released from prison, but when Islamic fundamentalists consolidate their grip on power, they hunt Anoosh down, imprison him, and later execute him. Her new idol killed, Marji feels crushed. She completely abandons her faith in God and increasingly questions the pro-regime propaganda she hears—especially at school.
Marji deeply loves and identifies with of her parents, even if she does sometimes feel that their actions and behavior (as wealthy and privileged individuals) do not always live up to their pro-democratic and liberal rhetoric. Marji also has a special connection with her grandmother, who remains stoic and inspiring to Marji in spite of the turmoil and numerous tragedies stemming from political actions that impact her and the family. Marji’s uncle Anoosh is not Marji’s only direct experience with the cruel consequences of the government’s actions. Throughout the book, death and devastation occurs among Marji’s extended family and friends as direct results of the brutality and fanaticism of the Iranian regimes and the war with Iraq.
People had rejoiced when the Shah was forced out, but as Islamic fundamentalists retain power, Marji and her family watch as their neighbors’ behavior shifts back and forth to coincide with the current political winds. The neighbors go from wearing short skirts and drinking alcohol to covering themselves and denouncing the use of alcohol. Marji’s parents ask her to tell everyone that she prays every day, a lie they hope will keep Marji safe, but acknowledge that the rules seem foolish. Marji grows more rebellious, as she increasingly views the rules at school and elsewhere as hypocritical and difficult to follow. Armed with more knowledge and personal experience, Marji begins to act out in ways that put her safety at risk. In fact, she even (accidentally) hits her principal during an argument, which results in her expulsion from school. Fearing her rebellious behavior will get her killed, Marji’s mother tries to reason with Marji by telling her that it is not her responsibility to serve justice and that the bad guys eventually pay for their sins in the end.
The war with Iraq had originally inspired Marji to vocal patriotism in protection her country against another invasion, but Marji begins to realize there are greater forces behind the war. She sees how the Islamic regime needs the war to continue survive and keep power. The war promotes a sense of nationalism and pride in the public, and those who die in the war are hailed as “martyrs.” Marji sees thousands of poor boys lured into war without proper training. She becomes increasingly uncomfortable and aware of class differences within society. Poor young boys are lured into the army with gold-painted keys to the “kingdom of heaven” to help them enter paradise after dying on the battlefield, while children in her wealthy neighborhood are left alone.
More and more people try to escape Iran as the borders tighten and Iraqi forces bomb Tehran and other Iranian cities. Realizing that Marji’s chances of escaping Iran are narrowing, her parents make the difficult decision to send her abroad alone to finish school in Vienna, explaining that only a good education will free her of Iran. Marji feels heartbroken. She spends one last night with her grandmother, who gives her warm advice and inspires her to be compassionate and understanding while in Vienna. Marji gives away all of her prized contraband to her friends, including a Kim Wilde poster. At the airport, as Marji turns to say goodbye to her parents one last time to see that her mother, devasted by her only child’s departure, has fainted."

Declaration,"In Common Sense, Thomas Paine argues for American independence. His argument begins with more general, theoretical reflections about government and religion, then progresses onto the specifics of the colonial situation.
Paine begins by distinguishing between government and society. Society, according to Paine, is everything constructive and good that people join together to accomplish. Government, on the other hand, is an institution whose sole purpose is to protect us from our own vices. Government has its origins in the evil of man and is therefore a necessary evil at best. Paine says that government's sole purpose is to protect life, liberty and property, and that a government should be judged solely on the basis of the extent to which it accomplishes this goal.
Paine then considers an imagined scenario in which a small group of people has been placed on an island, and cut off from the rest of society. In time, these people develop ties with one another, and lawmaking becomes inevitable. Paine says the people will be much happier if they are responsible for the creation of the laws that rule them. Paine is also implicitly arguing that such a system of representation is also better for the American colonists. Having expressed his disagreement with British reign in America, Paine proceeds to launch a general attack on the British system of government. Paine says the British system is too complex and rife with contradictions, and that the monarchy is granted far too much power. The British system pretends to offer a reasonable system of checks and balances, but in fact, it does not.
From here Paine moves on to discuss, in general, the notions of monarchy and hereditary succession. Man, Pain argues, was born into a state of equality, and the distinction that has arisen between king and subject is an unnatural one. At first, Paine says, the world was without kings, but the ancient Jews decided they wanted a king. This angered God, but he allowed them to have one. Paine presents pages of biblical evidence detailing God's wrath at the idea of the Jews having a king. The conclusion Paine reaches is that the practice of monarchy originates from sin, and is an institution that the Bible and God condemn. Paine calls hereditary succession an abominable practice. He says that even if people were to choose to have a king, that does not legitimize that King's child acting as a future ruler. Furthermore, hereditary succession has brought with it innumerable evils, such as incompetent kings, corruption, and civil war.
Having dispensed with the preliminary theoretical issues, Paine sets in to discuss the details of the American situation. In response to the argument that America has flourished under British rule, and therefore ought to stay under the king, Paine says that such an argument fails to realize that America has evolved and no longer needs Britain's help. Some say that Britain has protected America, and therefore deserves allegiance, but Paine responds that Britain has only watched over America in order to secure its own economic well-being. Paine adds that most recently, instead of watching over the colonies, the British have been attacking them, and are therefore undeserving of American loyalty.
Paine says that the colonies have little to gain from remaining attached to Britain. Commerce can be better conducted with the rest of Europe, but only after America becomes independent. Paine also asserts that if the colonies remain attached to Britain, the same problems that have arisen in the past will arise in the future. Paine argues that it is necessary to seek independence now, as to do otherwise would only briefly cover up problems that will surely reemerge.
Paine even proposes the form of government that the independent colonies should adopt. His recommendation is for a representative democracy that gives roughly equal weight to each of the colonies.
Paine explains why the current time is a good time to break free of Britain. Primarily, Paine focuses on the present size of the colonies, and on their current capabilities. He presents an inventory of the British Navy and gives calculations revealing how America could build a navy of comparable size. Paine recommends this as a way of ensuring America's security and prosperity in trade. Paine also argues that America is sufficiently small as to be united now. If time were to elapse, and the population of the colonies to grow, the same feeling of unity would not be present. Paine adds that if the Americans revolt now, they can use the vast expanses of uncharted land to the West in order to pay down some of the debt they will incur.
Paine says that as a colony of Britain, America lacks respectability on the international scene. They are seen simply as rebels, and cannot form substantial alliances with other nations. In order to prosper in the long term, the colonies need to be independent. Paine says that, by declaring independence, America will be able to ask for the help of other countries in its struggle for freedom. For all of these reasons, Paine says it is imperative and urgent that the colonies declare independence."
Earnest,"Jack Worthing, the play’s protagonist, is a pillar of the community in Hertfordshire, where he is guardian to Cecily Cardew, the pretty, eighteen-year-old granddaughter of the late Thomas Cardew, who found and adopted Jack when he was a baby. In Hertfordshire, Jack has responsibilities: he is a major landowner and justice of the peace, with tenants, farmers, and a number of servants and other employees all dependent on him. For years, he has also pretended to have an irresponsible black-sheep brother named Ernest who leads a scandalous life in pursuit of pleasure and is always getting into trouble of a sort that requires Jack to rush grimly off to his assistance. In fact, Ernest is merely Jack’s alibi, a phantom that allows him to disappear for days at a time and do as he likes. No one but Jack knows that he himself is Ernest. Ernest is the name Jack goes by in London, which is where he really goes on these occasions—probably to pursue the very sort of behavior he pretends to disapprove of in his imaginary brother.
Jack is in love with Gwendolen Fairfax, the cousin of his best friend, Algernon Moncrieff. When the play opens, Algernon, who knows Jack as Ernest, has begun to suspect something, having found an inscription inside Jack’s cigarette case addressed to “Uncle Jack” from someone who refers to herself as “little Cecily.” Algernon suspects that Jack may be leading a double life, a practice he seems to regard as commonplace and indispensable to modern life. He calls a person who leads a double life a “Bunburyist,” after a nonexistent friend he pretends to have, a chronic invalid named Bunbury, to whose deathbed he is forever being summoned whenever he wants to get out of some tiresome social obligation.
At the beginning of Act 1, Jack drops in unexpectedly on Algernon and announces that he intends to propose to Gwendolen. Algernon confronts him with the cigarette case and forces him to come clean, demanding to know who “Jack” and “Cecily” are. Jack confesses that his name isn’t really Ernest and that Cecily is his ward, a responsibility imposed on him by his adoptive father’s will. Jack also tells Algernon about his fictional brother. Jack says he’s been thinking of killing off this fake brother, since Cecily has been showing too active an interest in him. Without meaning to, Jack describes Cecily in terms that catch Algernon’s attention and make him even more interested in her than he is already.
Gwendolen and her mother, Lady Bracknell, arrive, which gives Jack an opportunity to propose to Gwendolen. Jack is delighted to discover that Gwendolen returns his affections, but he is alarmed to learn that Gwendolen is fixated on the name Ernest, which she says “inspires absolute confidence.” Gwendolen makes clear that she would not consider marrying a man who was not named Ernest.
Lady Bracknell interviews Jack to determine his eligibility as a possible son-in-law, and during this interview she asks about his family background. When Jack explains that he has no idea who his parents were and that he was found, by the man who adopted him, in a handbag in the cloakroom at Victoria Station, Lady Bracknell is scandalized. She forbids the match between Jack and Gwendolen and sweeps out of the house.
In Act 2, Algernon shows up at Jack’s country estate posing as Jack’s brother Ernest. Meanwhile, Jack, having decided that Ernest has outlived his usefulness, arrives home in deep mourning, full of a story about Ernest having died suddenly in Paris. He is enraged to find Algernon there masquerading as Ernest but has to go along with the charade. If he doesn’t, his own lies and deceptions will be revealed.
While Jack changes out of his mourning clothes, Algernon, who has fallen hopelessly in love with Cecily, asks her to marry him. He is surprised to discover that Cecily already considers that they are engaged, and he is charmed when she reveals that her fascination with “Uncle Jack’s brother” led her to invent an elaborate romance between herself and him several months ago. Algernon is less enchanted to learn that part of Cecily’s interest in him derives from the name Ernest, which, unconsciously echoing Gwendolen, she says “inspires absolute confidence.”
Algernon goes off in search of Dr. Chasuble, the local rector, to see about getting himself christened Ernest. Meanwhile, Gwendolen arrives, having decided to pay Jack an unexpected visit. Gwendolen is shown into the garden, where Cecily orders tea and attempts to play hostess. Cecily has no idea how Gwendolen figures into Jack’s life, and Gwendolen, for her part, has no idea who Cecily is. Gwendolen initially thinks Cecily is a visitor to the Manor House and is disconcerted to learn that Cecily is “Mr. Worthing’s ward.” She notes that Ernest has never mentioned having a ward, and Cecily explains that it is not Ernest Worthing who is her guardian but his brother Jack and, in fact, that she is engaged to be married to Ernest Worthing. Gwendolen points out that this is impossible as she herself is engaged to Ernest Worthing. The tea party degenerates into a war of manners.
Jack and Algernon arrive toward the climax of this confrontation, each having separately made arrangements with Dr. Chasuble to be christened Ernest later that day. Each of the young ladies points out that the other has been deceived: Cecily informs Gwendolen that her fiancé is really named Jack and Gwendolen informs Cecily that hers is really called Algernon. The two women demand to know where Jack’s brother Ernest is, since both of them are engaged to be married to him. Jack is forced to admit that he has no brother and that Ernest is a complete fiction. Both women are shocked and furious, and they retire to the house arm in arm.
Act 3 takes place in the drawing room of the Manor House, where Cecily and Gwendolen have retired. When Jack and Algernon enter from the garden, the two women confront them. Cecily asks Algernon why he pretended to be her guardian’s brother. Algernon tells her he did it in order to meet her. Gwendolen asks Jack whether he pretended to have a brother in order to come into London to see her as often as possible, and she interprets his evasive reply as an affirmation. The women are somewhat appeased but still concerned over the issue of the name. However, when Jack and Algernon tell Gwendolen and Cecily that they have both made arrangements to be christened Ernest that afternoon, all is forgiven and the two pairs of lovers embrace. At this moment, Lady Bracknell’s arrival is announced.
Lady Bracknell has followed Gwendolen from London, having bribed Gwendolen’s maid to reveal her destination. She demands to know what is going on. Gwendolen again informs Lady Bracknell of her engagement to Jack, and Lady Bracknell reiterates that a union between them is out of the question. Algernon tells Lady Bracknell of his engagement to Cecily, prompting her to inspect Cecily and inquire into her social connections, which she does in a routine and patronizing manner that infuriates Jack. He replies to all her questions with a mixture of civility and sarcasm, withholding until the last possible moment the information that Cecily is actually worth a great deal of money and stands to inherit still more when she comes of age. At this, Lady Bracknell becomes genuinely interested.
Jack informs Lady Bracknell that, as Cecily’s legal guardian, he refuses to give his consent to her union with Algernon. Lady Bracknell suggests that the two young people simply wait until Cecily comes of age, and Jack points out that under the terms of her grandfather’s will, Cecily does not legally come of age until she is thirty-five. Lady Bracknell asks Jack to reconsider, and he points out that the matter is entirely in her own hands. As soon as she consents to his marriage to Gwendolen, Cecily can have his consent to marry Algernon. However, Lady Bracknell refuses to entertain the notion. She and Gwendolen are on the point of leaving when Dr. Chasuble arrives and happens to mention Cecily’s governess, Miss Prism. At this, Lady Bracknell starts and asks that Miss Prism be sent for.
When the governess arrives and catches sight of Lady Bracknell, she begins to look guilty and furtive. Lady Bracknell accuses her of having left her sister’s house twenty-eight years before with a baby and never returned. She demands to know where the baby is. Miss Prism confesses she doesn’t know, explaining that she lost the baby, having absentmindedly placed it in a handbag in which she had meant to place the manuscript for a novel she had written. Jack asks what happened to the bag, and Miss Prism says she left it in the cloakroom of a railway station. Jack presses her for further details and goes racing offstage, returning a few moments later with a large handbag. When Miss Prism confirms that the bag is hers, Jack throws himself on her with a cry of “Mother!” It takes a while before the situation is sorted out, but before too long we understand that Jack is not the illegitimate child of Miss Prism but the legitimate child of Lady Bracknell’s sister and, therefore, Algernon’s older brother. Furthermore, Jack had been originally christened “Ernest John.” All these years Jack has unwittingly been telling the truth: Ernest is his name, as is Jack, and he does have an unprincipled younger brother—Algernon. Again the couples embrace, Miss Prism and Dr. Chasuble follow suit, and Jack acknowledges that he now understands “the vital Importance of Being Earnest.”"
Humiliation,"Speak, by Laurie Halse Anderson, chronicles the struggles of thirteen-year-old Melinda Sordino after she is a raped by at a party the summer before her freshman year of high school by another student. Melinda tells her story in first person narrative. She describes events within the framework of the four marking periods of the school year.
In the opening part of Speak, “First Marking Period,” Melinda begins high school, and we learn that former friends now hate her. She experiences humiliation in the cafeteria and Mr. Neck, a social studies teacher, further embarrasses her by giving her demerits on the first day of school. Ostracized by her former friends, she befriends Heather, a new girl at the school. Heather seeks popularity, and she badgers Melinda to join various clubs. Rachel, Melinda’s ex-best friend, hasn’t tried to find out the truth about what really happened to Melinda that night at the party over the summer.
Melinda describes her classes, activities, and thoughts. Her project in Mr. Freeman’s art class is to create a work of art based on a “tree,” which is the object named on the piece of paper she randomly chooses. In biology, Melinda thinks that David Petrakis, her lab partner, might be cute without the braces. And in algebra, when Mr. Stetman has Rachel come to the board to help Melinda with a problem, Melinda is humiliated. 
Melinda often skips class using stolen late passes and doesn’t complete her homework. She finds refuge at school in a vacant janitor’s closet, which she turns into her “burrow.” At the Homecoming Rally, students bully her for being the one who called the cops that night at the party.
At home, Melinda and her parents communicate with each other by leaving notes on the refrigerator. In her bedroom, she no longer wants to look in the mirror and puts it in the back of her closet. Toward the end of the marking period, Melinda’s parents hear from the school about her missing work, and she remains silent while they berate her for failing. Through it all, Melinda sees “IT” everywhere, the nightmare from which she cannot awaken.
In “Second Marking Period,” school is a grind for Melinda. At her parents’ insistence, she stays after to finish her homework, but she goes to her burrow and naps instead. In social studies, David Petrakis stands up against Mr. Neck’s racist rant about immigration. In biology, she finds that a seed within the apple she has cut is already growing. Heather gives her an early Christmas present, and Melinda decides she’ll give Heather a friendship necklace. 
On Christmas, Melinda nearly tells her parents what happened that night last summer but can’t. Winter break is miserable. Her parents keep her busy working for them, and she is relieved when school starts again. 
In gym class, Melinda impresses the basketball coaches with skills but has no interest in being on the team. She reluctantly helps Heather in her attempts to become an initiated member of a do-good club. And in biology, when she and David dissect a frog, she faints when preparing to slice it open. 
Melinda’s parents receive another call from the guidance counselor about her grades. After their verbal assault, Melinda goes to her room and uses an open paper clip to scrape at her wrist. 
“IT”, who we learn is Andy Evans, harasses Melinda in the cafeteria, and she runs to the bathroom to vomit. She has yet to tell anyone, even the reader, about what happened that summer night.
In “Third Marking Period,” Melinda continues to skip school and avoid Andy Evans. Heather ends their friendship suddenly, and later returns the friendship necklace Melinda had given her for Christmas. No one, Melinda is sure, “would like the inside girl I think I am.” 
The school counselors hold another meeting with Melinda’s parents, who berate and threaten her. She refuses to talk or defend herself. She receives In-School Suspension, and IT is there. He sits next to her and blows in her ear when Mr. Neck isn’t looking. 
In art class, Mr. Freeman gives Melinda a book about Picasso to help her “paralyzed” imagination. Picasso’s art inspires her, and she begins to draw. Mr. Freeman recognizes that she has a lot to say.
Melinda works to meet the expectations set for her. Yet, with “no friends in the known universe,” Melinda sits alone at lunch, wondering if everyone is talking and laughing about her. 
One afternoon, after a basketball game, David Petrakis invites her to his house for pizza to celebrate the team’s one-point win. She declines, torn between getting a life, and the fact that the world is a dangerous place.
At last, Melinda reveals that she was attacked at a party last summer, though she does not use the word “rape.” At this point, we (the readers) are the only ones besides Melinda who know what happened.
In “Fourth Marking Period,” Melinda takes her ex-friend Ivy’s advice and tries drawing a tree instead of carving one from linoleum block. She also learns that Rachel is dating Andy Evans. Compelled to do something, she writes a note to Rachel warning her about Andy. In the note, she admits for the first time (but without divulging her identity), that she was raped. 
Springtime arrives, and Melinda finds solace working in the garden. She and David plan a protest in social studies class over an oral report she is supposed to present, and she stands up to Heather by refusing to help her decorate for the Senior Prom. She writes on a stall in the bathroom, “Guys to Stay Away From: Andy Evans.” Andy Evans continues to bully her. 
Melinda feels compelled to tell Rachel the truth about Andy and what happened that night. But, when Rachel learns that Andy Evans was Melinda’s attacker, she accuses Melinda of being jealous and calls her a “twisted little freak.” Later, Ivy brings Melinda into the bathroom stall. Other girls have added words like “creep” and “bastard” under Andy Evan’s name. Seeing that, Melinda feels like she can fly.
Melinda realizes she doesn’t need her burrow anymore. When she is clearing her items out of the closet, Andy Evans barges in, attacks Melinda, and tries to rape her again. She finds her voice and screams “NNNOOO!!” He does not back off, so Melinda breaks a mirror, takes a shard of glass, and holds it to his neck. “I said no,” she tells him. People who had heard her scream run for help.
With hours left in the school year, Melinda finds herself a sort of hero. She finishes her tree project, receiving an A+ from Mr. Freeman."
As,"A Raisin in the Sun portrays a few weeks in the life of the Youngers, a Black family living on the South Side of Chicago in the 1950s. When the play opens, the Youngers are about to receive an insurance check for $10,000. This money comes from the deceased Mr. Younger’s life insurance policy. Each of the adult members of the family has an idea as to what he or she would like to do with this money. The matriarch of the family, Mama, wants to buy a house to fulfill a dream she shared with her husband. Mama’s son, Walter Lee, would rather use the money to invest in a liquor store with his friends. He believes that the investment will solve the family’s financial problems forever. Walter’s wife, Ruth, agrees with Mama, however, and hopes that she and Walter can provide more space and opportunity for their son, Travis. Finally, Beneatha, Walter’s sister and Mama’s daughter, wants to use the money for her medical school tuition. She also wishes that her family members were not so interested in assimilating into the white world. Beneatha instead tries to find her identity by looking back to the past and to Africa.
As the play progresses, the Youngers clash over their competing dreams. Ruth discovers that she is pregnant but fears that if she has the child, she will put more financial pressure on her family members. When Walter says nothing to Ruth’s admission that she is considering abortion, Mama puts a down payment on a house for the whole family. She believes that a bigger, brighter dwelling will help them all. This house is in Clybourne Park, an entirely white neighborhood. When the Youngers’ future neighbors find out that the Youngers are moving in, they send Mr. Lindner, from the Clybourne Park Improvement Association, to offer the Youngers money in return for staying away. The Youngers refuse the deal, even after Walter loses the rest of the money ($6,500) to his friend Willy Harris, who persuades Walter to invest in the liquor store and then runs off with his cash.
In the meantime, Beneatha rejects her suitor, George Murchison, whom she believes to be shallow and blind to the problems of race. Subsequently, she receives a marriage proposal from her Nigerian boyfriend, Joseph Asagai, who wants Beneatha to get a medical degree and move to Africa with him (Beneatha does not make her choice before the end of the play). The Youngers eventually move out of the apartment, fulfilling the family’s long-held dream. Their future seems uncertain and slightly dangerous, but they are optimistic and determined to live a better life. They believe that they can succeed if they stick together as a family and resolve to defer their dreams no longer."
Prisoners,"A wake-up call sounds in a Stalinist labor camp in 1951, on a bitterly cold winter morning. Ivan Denisovich Shukhov, a prisoner in Camp HQ, is usually up on time, but this morning he suffers a fever and aches, and yearns for a little more time in bed. Thinking that a kindly guard is on duty, he rests past the wake-up call a while. Unfortunately, a different guard is making the rounds, and he punishes Shukhov for oversleeping with three days in the solitary confinement cell, which the characters call “the hole.” Led off, Shukhov soon realizes that the sentence is just a threat, and that he will only have to wash the floors of the officers’ headquarters. Shukhov removes his shoes and efficiently completes the job, proceeding quickly to the mess hall, where he worries he has missed breakfast. He meets the sniveling Fetyukov, a colleague who has saved Shukhov’s gruel for him. After breakfast, Shukhov heads to sick bay to get his fever and aches examined. The medical orderly, Kolya, tells him he should have been ill the previous night, since the clinic is closed in the morning. Shukhov’s fever is not high enough to get him off work.
Shukhov returns to the hut in time for the body search and body count, in which the prisoners are searched for forbidden articles and counted to make sure none have escaped. He carefully hides the bread he has taken at breakfast, sewing it into his mattress. The men undress in the freezing cold for the search. One inmate, Buynovsky, is wearing a flannel vest. He is sentenced to ten days in the hole for this infraction. Shukhov is happy not to have any forbidden things on him. He has neither food nor letters to his family, which he does not write anymore. He reflects on his wife’s recent letter urging him to take up carpet-dyeing when he gets out of prison. But Shukhov is not interested in this opportunity, despite the easy money.
After the search, Shukhov’s group, Gang 104, is marched off for work at the Power Station, a building site in the open fields. At the site, Shukhov looks at his colleague Alyoshka, a devout Baptist who seems happy to slave away. Shukhov is filled with respect for his foreman, Tyurin, a big tough man with a decent soul. Though they are forbidden to do so, the men try to keep the wind out of the windows by covering them with tar paper. The teenage prisoner Gopchik fetches wire for piping, and asks Shukhov to show him how to make a spoon. They all rest a while. It is too soon before the noon meal to start laying bricks, as the mortar would only dry in the trough while they ate.
At the noon meal, Shukhov sneaks a second helping of food. He is full after eating two bowls of gruel. The gang returns to the work site. On the way, Shukhov spots a bit of scrap metal in the snow, which he takes and hides in the hopes of making a knife out of it later. The prisoners stoke the stove. While preparing to work again, the gang hears Tyurin’s tale of being imprisoned for having a rich peasant father. The men begin to mortar the wall. One of the deputy foremen, Pavlo, agrees to be on the mortar team, though, as an officer, he is not required to mortar. Pavlo’s friendliness earns him the men’s respect. The bricklaying begins. Shukhov works feverishly and makes no errors. A camp manager stops by to chide Tyurin for the tar paper illegally hung in the work site windows. He threatens to punish Tyurin, but Tyurin waves him off. Alyoshka works selflessly. Time passes quickly, and the men hear the meal signal. Shukhov continues working, even after his colleague Kildigs has stopped. He is late to lunch now, but he wants to hide his precious trowel, a tool that is hard to get, so that another man will not take it. He is nearly unable to join his gang, but catches up when the gang is delayed by preparations for another body count. The men discover that a man from Moldavia is missing from another gang. The man, who has fallen asleep at the site, is finally found. The other men are furious at him for delaying their meal.
Shukhov remembers his earlier intention to go to sick bay but reflects that he would rather have supper. At the body search, Shukhov suddenly panics, remembering the bit of steel he has hidden in his mitten. He prays to God to be kept out of the hole. By a stroke of good luck, the guard does not discover the bit of steel. Shukhov returns to the camp. On the suspicion that a fellow inmate, Tsezar, has received a rich parcel of food, he offers to wait in line in the parcel room for Tsezar. Shukhov waits until Tsezar comes. There is indeed a package. Shukhov makes his way to the mess hall for supper, where the gangs are being admitted by twos instead of singly, creating a chaos inside. He manages to find his comrades, grab an empty tray, and bring their rations to the table. For his outstanding labor at the Power Station, Shukhov has been awarded 400 grams of bread. He eats in bliss, eyeing his extra rations to make sure no one grabs them. He takes Tsezar’s ration to the hut, where Tsezar, in exception to the camp rules, is allowed to eat. Tsezar has displayed the contents of his parcel to everyone, and he allows Shukhov to keep Tsezar’s supper ration.
After the body count, Shukhov prepares to sleep, though the second count has not yet been completed. He revels in his abundance of bread. At the second roll call, Tsezar panics, unsure what to do with his parcel. Shukhov helps him guard it from the other prisoners. Tsezar rewards Shukhov with a couple of biscuits and a bit of sausage. Before sleeping, Shukhov thanks God for getting him through another day. Alyoshka hears Shukhov’s prayer, and urges Shukhov to pray properly. He also encourages Shukhov to pursue the goods of the spirit and not, as Tsezar does, those of the flesh. Shukhov reflects on Alyoshka’s sentiment. Suddenly, for no reason, he hands Alyoshka one of his biscuits. Shukhov meditates that his day has been almost happy. The narrator adds that this day has been just one of the 3,653 days of Shukhov’s sentence."
Seaboards,"The novel opens in the year 1902, in the town of New Rochelle, New York, at the house of an upper class family comprised of Mother, Father, and the little boy. Mother's Younger Brother falls in love with the famous beauty Evelyn Nesbit, whose husband Harry Thaw has recently been charged with the murder of her ex- husband, architect Stanford White. Harry Houdini's car breaks in front of the family's house, and he pays them a visit. Father leaves on a trip to the Arctic with the explorer Peary.
An immigrant family, consisting of Mameh, Tateh, and the little girl, live in the Lower East Side in utter poverty. Evelyn Nesbit visits the Lower East Side, where she becomes enchanted with Tateh's daughter, and soon her visits become regular. The little girl becomes ill, and Evelyn cares for her. Mother's Younger Brother begins to follow Evelyn everywhere without her knowledge. Tateh, Evelyn Nesbit, and the little girl attend a socialist meeting whose featured speaker, Emma Goldman, criticizes Evelyn for employing her sexuality to gain prominence in capitalistic society. Mother rescues and claims responsibility for a newborn baby she discovers buried alive in her backyard; she soon learns it is the child of a Black washwoman named Sarah.
Evelyn Nesbit and Mother's Younger Brother start to see a lot of one another. Mother's Younger Brother helps Evelyn search for Tateh and his little girl, but to no avail. Tateh and his daughter happily leave New York City and travel up the Eastern seaboard. Meanwhile, Houdini learns how to fly planes, and performs a demonstration for Archduke Franz Ferdinand and Countess Sophie. Father experiences a feeling of profound isolation upon his return to New Rochelle. Mother's Younger Brother becomes proficient in the use of bombs. Tateh and his little girl travel to Lawrence, Massachusetts, where there is a strike against the textile mills, and continue to many other cities.
In Philadelphia, Tateh finds a novelty store where the owner agrees to buy the movie books Tateh has invented. Tateh decides they will return to Lawrence to settle down. Henry Ford pays a lunch visit to J.P. Morgan and they discuss technology and religion. One afternoon, a Black man named Coalhouse Walker stops by their home in New Rochelle, asking to see Sarah, who refuses to see him. After Coalhouse continues to call on her every Sunday, Sarah finally accepts his proposal for marriage. One day Coalhouse Walker is driving to New York when volunteers from the Emerald Isle firehouse bar his path. While Coalhouse seeks help from the police, the volunteers wreck his car. When Coalhouse complains he is arrested. Coalhouse dedicates the funds he originally intended for his wedding toward securing a lawyer. However, he cannot find a lawyer willing to represent him.
One night, Sarah leaves the house to attend an event at which Mr. Taft's Vice- President would be present; she wishes to petition the federal government on Coalhouse's behalf. However, the secret service men hit her hard in the chest; she soon grows ill and dies. Coalhouse and his followers cause an explosion at the Emerald Isle firehouse, killing four volunteers. Father and Mother's Younger Brother fight over the situation, and Mother's Younger Brother leaves the household to join Coalhouse and his followers. Mother and Father move to Atlantic City to escape the scrutiny of the townspeople. Willie Conklin also begins to feel a lot of pressure to leave town. Mother and Father meet Tateh in Atlantic City, and the little boy and the little girl soon begin to spend a lot of time together.
Coalhouse and his followers break into the library of J.P. Morgan, who is abroad at the time. The District Attorney Charles S. Whitman calls Coalhouse, who reiterates to him his original demands that they return his vehicle and that Conklin dies for Sarah's death. Booker T. Washington attempts to persuade Coalhouse to end his siege, but soon leaves out of frustration. Father then meets with Coalhouse, and approaches Whitman with his demands, at which point Whitman presents Coalhouse with both his Model T and Willie Conklin. After his followers leave free of punishment, Coalhouse exits Morgan's house, and Father, still inside, hears the firing squad. Police report that Coalhouse had made an attempt at escaping, but he more likely made a slight movement that he knew would cause his death. Mother's Younger Brother, having secured the use of Coalhouse's Model-T, travels all around the country and soon to Mexico, where he joins revolutionary forces and dies about a year later.
As tensions in Europe develop, World War I approaches. Morgan travels to Egypt, where he hopes a visit to the pyramids will restore his sense of spirituality. Rather, he cannot sleep and becomes disheartened by his failure to experience what he has expected. Soon his health rapidly deteriorates and he dies. The narrator describes the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and Countess Sophie. Father dies aboard the Lusitania, and a year after his death, Tateh and Mother marry each other."
Mind,"Out of My Mind is told from the point of view of an eleven-year-old girl named Melody Brooks who was born with cerebral palsy. Melody cannot walk, talk, feed herself, or take herself to the bathroom. Her parents work hard at taking care of Melody. Their next-door neighbor, Mrs. Violet Valencia, also known as Mrs. V, is Melody’s part-time caregiver. Melody is extremely intelligent and absorbs all that she hears and sees. She has a photographic memory. She finds that she can hear colors and smell images when music is played. Melody wishes she wasn’t so restricted and wants to be able to live and communicate like any other kid.
When Melody is five years old, her mother takes her to a doctor, Dr. Hugely, to determine how smart she is and whether she can be enrolled in school. The doctor gives Melody inadequate assessments. He determines that Melody is severely brain-damaged. He suggests her parents send her to a school for the developmentally disabled or put her in a residential facility, so they do not have the burden of raising her. Her mother knows there is so much more to Melody and that she has true intelligence inside her. She tells Dr. Hugely he is wrong and insensitive, and she is going to enroll Melody in Spaulding Street Elementary School.
Melody starts elementary school and spends the next five years in a program designed for children with special needs. Initially, she is excited to be in classroom H-5, but eventually finds the learning program to be repetitive and unchallenging. When Melody was younger, her mother had attached a plastic tray to her wheelchair with common words, numbers, and phrases pasted on it for Melody to point to so she could communicate. Over time, that tray becomes too simplistic for Melody. Mrs. V wants to help Melody gain more language skills. She redesigns Melody’s communication board with a larger variety of nouns, verbs, adjectives, and pictures of people in her life so that Melody can point to them with her thumb and form a sentence. Mrs. V creates flash cards and teaches Melody new words every day. When Melody turns eight, her parents surprise her with a puppy named Butterscotch. A short time later, they welcome a new baby girl to the family, giving Melody a little sister named Penny.
When Melody starts fifth grade, her parents present her with an electric wheelchair, which gives Melody a sense of freedom she has never had before. Her school also starts an inclusion program to allow the H-5 students to interact with the other classes. During these classes, Melody meets a nice girl named Rose. Unfortunately, she also encounters two girls, Molly and Claire, who both have a reputation for being mean to almost everyone. Melody’s teacher, Mrs. Shannon, hires Catherine as an aide to help Melody in her classes. Melody and Catherine find a device called a Medi-Talker on the internet to help Melody communicate. Melody’s parents order it for her. The device provides a voice for her thoughts.
In Melody’s language arts class, her teacher, Miss Gordon, tells the students about an autobiography project they will be doing at the end of the year. Mr. Dimming, Melody’s history teacher, has the class participate in a practice exercise for their school’s Whiz Kids quiz team. Every year the school sends a team to the Whiz Kids competition. During the practice exercise, Melody achieves a perfect score. Her teacher and her classmates, particularly Molly and Claire, are shocked and skeptical. This skepticism bothers Melody but with the help of Catherine in school, and Mrs. V after school, she studies hard to properly prepare for the team tryouts. Melody takes the real test, getting another perfect score, and secures a place on the school team. Mr. Dimming apologizes to Melody for underestimating her. The quiz team spends the next two weeks studying and practicing after school. Even though Melody is part of the team, she does not feel a sense of belonging.
The Spaulding Street Elementary team competes in the southwest Ohio regional competition and wins. Melody receives an unwanted amount of media attention, which makes her team members jealous.
The Brooks family and Mrs. V take Melody and her mom to the airport so they can catch a plane headed to the Whiz Kids national finals in Washington, D.C. When they arrive at the airport, an airline employee informs them that their plane has been canceled due to bad weather. She tells them that the rest of the team arrived early and was able to board a different flight before the cancellations began. Melody is distraught that her team left her behind.
The next morning, Melody’s father comes into her room with the news that the team came in ninth place in the D.C. finals and won a tiny trophy. Melody decides she wants to go to school to show that she can rise above the whole situation and to see Catherine. It’s a very stormy day and due to the lightning, Melody is forced to use her manual wheelchair and her old Plexiglas communication board. With difficulty, her mother gets her into the car for school. Suddenly, Melody sees Penny run out of the house. Melody realizes her mother didn’t notice, so she starts frantically screaming and flailing about. Her mother, frustrated with Melody and the morning’s events, starts backing the car down the driveway, and they feel a soft thump. Horrified, they realize it was Penny. Penny has a badly broken leg and will undergo a surgical procedure, but she will be fine.
Melody goes to school to face her quiz team teammates. They all make excuses, even Mr. Dimming, as to why they didn’t call her and why they left her behind. The team wants to give Melody their little plastic trophy to make up for it. Melody starts giggling when suddenly her hand jerks, knocking the trophy to the ground and causing it to break. She uses her Medi-Talker to say that she doesn’t want it and they deserve it. Still laughing, she leaves the room.
At the end of fifth grade, Melody thinks that maybe she is not so different from everyone else after all. Perhaps she carries some of the same worries and attitudes as other fifth graders. She starts working on her autobiography for Miss Gordon’s class. She begins her autobiography titled Out of My Mind with ""I'm surrounded by thousands of words,"" the exact same words that start the book."
Children,"Saleem Sinai, the narrator of Midnight’s Children, opens the novel by explaining that he was born on midnight, August 15, 1947, at the exact moment India gained its independence from British rule. Now nearing his thirty-first birthday, Saleem believes that his body is beginning to crack and fall apart. Fearing that his death is imminent, he grows anxious to tell his life story. Padma, his loyal and loving companion, serves as his patient, often skeptical audience.
Saleem’s story begins in Kashmir, thirty-two years before his birth, in 1915. There, Saleem’s grandfather, a doctor named Aadam Aziz, begins treating Naseem, the woman who becomes Saleem’s grandmother. For the first three years Aadam Aziz treats her, Naseem is always covered by a sheet with a small hole in it that is moved to expose the part of her that is sick. Aadam Aziz sees his future wife’s face for the first time on the same day World War I ends, in 1918. Aadam Aziz and Naseem marry, and the couple moves to Agra, where Aadam—a doctor whose loss of religious faith has affected him deeply—sees how protests in the name of independence get violently suppressed. Aadam and Naseem have three daughters, Alia, Mumtaz, and Emerald, and two sons, Mustapha and Hanif. Aadam becomes a follower of the optimistic activist Mian Abdullah, whose anti-Partition stance eventually leads to his assassination. Following Abdullah’s death, Aadam hides Abdullah’s frightened assistant, Nadir Khan, despite his wife’s opposition. While living in the basement, Nadir Khan falls in love with Mumtaz, and the two are secretly married. However, after two years of marriage, Aadam finds out that his daughter is still a virgin, as Nadir and Mumtaz have yet to consummate their marriage. Nadir Khan is sent running for his life when Mumtaz’s sister, Emerald, tells Major Zulfikar—an officer in the Pakistani army, soon to be Emerald’s husband—about his hiding place in the house. Abandoned by her husband, Mumtaz agrees to marry Ahmed Sinai, a young merchant who until then had been courting her sister, Alia.
Mumtaz changes her name to Amina and moves to Delhi with her new husband. Pregnant, she goes to a fortune-teller who delivers a cryptic prophecy about her unborn son, declaring that the boy will never be older or younger than his country and claiming that he sees two heads, knees and a nose. After a terrorist organization burns down Ahmed’s factory, Ahmed and Amina move to Bombay. They buy a house from a departing Englishman, William Methwold, who owns an estate at the top of a hill. Wee Willie Winky, a poor man who entertains the families of Methwold’s Estate, says that his wife, Vanita, is also expecting a child soon. Unbeknownst to Wee Willie Winky, Vanita had an affair with William Methwold, and he is the true father of her unborn child. Amina and Vanita both go into labor, and, at exactly midnight, each woman delivers a son. Meanwhile, a midwife at the nursing home, Mary Pereira, is preoccupied with thoughts of her radical socialist lover, Joseph D’Costa. Wanting to make him proud, she switches the nametags of the two newborn babies, thereby giving the poor baby a life of privilege and the rich baby a life of poverty. Driven by a sense of guilt afterward, she becomes an ayah, or nanny, to Saleem.
Because it occurs at the exact moment India gains its independence, the press heralds Saleem’s birth as hugely significant. Young Saleem has an enormous cucumberlike nose and blue eyes like those of his grandfather, Aadam Aziz. His mischievous sister, nicknamed the Brass Monkey, is born a few years later. Overwhelmed by the expectations laid on him by the prophecy, and ridiculed by other children for his huge nose, Saleem takes to hiding in a washing chest. While hiding one day, he sees his mother sitting down on the toilet; when Amina discovers him, she punishes Saleem to one day of silence. Unable to speak, he hears, for the first time, a babble of voices in his head. He realizes he has the power of telepathy and can enter anyone’s thoughts. Eventually, Saleem begins to hear the thoughts of other children born during the first hour of independence. The 1,001 midnight’s children—a number reduced to 581 by their tenth birthday—all have magical powers, which vary according to how close to midnight they were born. Saleem discovers that Shiva, the boy with whom he was switched at birth, was born with a pair of enormous, powerful knees and a gift for combat.
One day, Saleem loses a portion of his finger in an accident and is rushed to the hospital, where his parents learn that according to Saleem’s blood type, he couldn’t possibly be their biological son. After he leaves the hospital, Saleem is sent to live with his Uncle Hanif and Aunt Pia for a while. Shortly after Saleem returns home to his parents, Hanif commits suicide. While the family mourns Hanif’s death, Mary confesses to having switched Saleem and Shiva at birth. Ahmed—now an alcoholic—grows violent with Amina, prompting her to take Saleem and the Brass Monkey to Pakistan, where she moves in with Emerald. In Pakistan, Saleem watches as Emerald’s husband, General Zulfikar, stages a coup against the Pakistani government and ushers in a period of martial law.
Four years later, after Ahmed suffers a heart failure, Amina and the children move back to Bombay. India goes to war with China, while Saleem’s perpetually congested nose undergoes a medical operation. As a result, he loses his telepathic powers but, in return, gains an incredible sense of smell, with which he can detect emotions.
Saleem’s entire family moves to Pakistan after India’s military loss to China. His younger sister, now known as Jamila Singer, becomes the most famous singer in Pakistan. Already on the brink of ruin, Saleem’s entire family—save Jamila and himself—dies in the span of a single day during the war between India and Pakistan. During the air raids, Saleem gets hit in the head by his grandfather’s silver spittoon, which erases his memory entirely.
Relieved of his memory, Saleem is reduced to an animalistic state. He finds himself conscripted into military service, as his keen sense of smell makes him an excellent tracker. Though he doesn’t know exactly how he came to join the army, he suspects that Jamila sent him there as a punishment for having fallen in love with her. While in the army, Saleem helps quell the independence movement in Bangladesh. After witnessing a number of atrocities, however, he flees into the jungle with three of his fellow soldiers. In the jungle of the Sundarbans, he regains all of his memory except the knowledge of his name. After leaving the jungle, Saleem finds Parvati-the-witch, one of midnight’s children, who reminds him of his name and helps him escape back to India. He lives with her in the magician’s ghetto, along with a snake charmer named Picture Singh.
Disappointed that Saleem will not marry her, Parvati-the-witch has an affair with Shiva, now a famous war hero. Things between Parvati and Shiva quickly sour, and she returns to the magicians’ ghetto, pregnant and still unmarried. There, the ghetto residents shun Parvati until Saleem agrees to marry her. Meanwhile, Indira Gandhi, the prime minister of India, begins a sterilization campaign. Shortly after the birth of Parvati’s son, the government destroys the magician’s ghetto. Parvati dies while Shiva captures Saleem and brings him to a forced sterilization camp. There, Saleem divulges the names of the other midnight’s children. One by one, the midnight’s children are rounded up and sterilized, effectively destroying the powers that so threaten the prime minister. Later, however, Indira Gandhi loses the first election she holds.
The midnight’s children, including Saleem, are all set free. Saleem goes in search of Parvati’s son, Aadam, who has been living with Picture Singh. The three take a trip to Bombay, so Picture Singh can challenge a man who claims to be the world’s greatest snake charmer. While in Bombay, Saleem eats some chutney that tastes exactly like the ones his ayah, Mary, used to make. He finds the chutney factory that Mary now owns, at which Padma stands guarding the gate. With this meeting, Saleem’s story comes full circle. His historical account finally complete, Saleem decides to marry Padma, his steadfast lover and listener, on his thirty-first birthday, which falls on the thirty-first anniversary of India’s independence. Saleem prophesies that he will die on that day, disintegrating into millions of specks of dust."
Shameful,"David Lurie, a white university professor and incorrigible womanizer from Cape Town, South Africa, relishes his weekly rendezvous with a young, Black prostitute named Soraya. David, who is middle-aged, twice divorced, and disenchanted with his life in academia, thinks his trysts have “solved the problem of sex,” an idea that means he believes they allow him to satisfy his sexual needs without the complications of a relationship. After a chance encounter where David happens upon Soraya and sees she has two young sons, everything changes. Soraya leaves the escort agency, and, after David hires a detective agency to find her phone number, she tells him he’s harassing her. David, acutely aware that he is aging, and that his younger, more vital self is fading, then sets his sights on Melanie Isaacs, a twenty-year-old student in his Romantic poets course. 
Despite Melanie’s age, status as a student, and expressed apprehension, David pressures her into having sex at his house. The experience rattles Melanie, but David pushes on. He finds her phone number and address, where he again pressures her to have sex, this time in a manner bordering on rape. Melanie’s boyfriend, Ryan, later confronts David in his office and classroom during a lesson on Byron’s poem “Lara,” which examines Lucifer’s flaws and fall from heaven. When David scolds Melanie and tells her she needs to work harder and improve her attendance, she withdraws from the university and files a complaint against him with the Vice-Rector’s office. At an ensuing hearing before a committee of his peers, David is mostly defiant. He offers only a weak apology, stating that he was merely following his natural desires. Eventually, the committee offers David a way to save his career by signing a written admittance of wrongdoing, but he declines, opting instead to leave the university in disgrace.
David, now in exile, travels to stay with his adult daughter, Lucy, on her farm in the Eastern Cape. Lucy lives there by herself, which causes David concern for her safety. Lucy earns her living by selling flowers and produce and by kenneling dogs with the help of her assistant, Petrus. During discussions with Lucy, David refuses to admit regret or responsibility for his affair with Melanie, again deferring to his desires. Although David tells Lucy he’s too old to change and become a good person, she convinces him to volunteer at the nearby animal clinic, led by her friend, Bev Shaw, whose services include euthanizing old, unwanted dogs. David also ponders his next work, an opera about the last years of the poet Byron’s life, marked by affairs and scandal. He helps Petrus on his portion of land, recently purchased from Lucy via a land grant. David views his helping Petrus as intriguing, given that Petrus is Black and because of South Africa’s past, where whites held power over Black people under a segregated system of Apartheid. 
Soon, David’s fears for Lucy’s safety manifest when three men, including one youth, force their way into the farmhouse, detain David in a bathroom, and rape Lucy. The men, who are Black, also shoot all but one of the farm’s kenneled dogs. The attack forces the characters of Disgrace and its readers to reckon with South Africa’s simmering racial tensions. In the days that follow, David questions why Petrus was away from his home during the attack, and if he orchestrated it to take over Lucy’s land. At a party at Petrus’s soon after, David’s suspicions grow when Lucy recognizes the youth who raped her, and Petrus becomes upset when David threatens to call the police. Lucy’s rape forces David to confront his attitudes and past actions regarding women, particularly Melanie. After Lucy remains largely silent about her rape for weeks, she eventually shares certain insights, saying the act was about hatred, power, and subjugation. What’s more, she tells David that, as a man, he likely understands.
In the days that follow, David’s aversion to change is further challenged. Through his work at the shelter with Bev, with whom he also has an affair, David learns compassion for animals, though remains cynical about his personal development. David also reluctantly sees that Lucy is no longer a child when she defies his insistence to report the rape and start over someplace new. As a result, David and Lucy’s relations grow more fraught, and he leaves the farm. Despite his newfound insights, David visits Melanie’s home in George, telling her father, Mr. Isaacs, that he wanted to apologize. Mr. Isaacs questions David’s motives, though, then evokes God and asks David if he’s truly sorry, after which David returns to Cape Town to find his life in ruins: His home has been ransacked, his finances are in chaos, and neighbors pretend not to see him. With little to do, David works on his opera about Byron, though decides to shift its focus from the fallen poet to Byron’s middle-aged lover, Teresa. David then attempts to see Melanie again, watching her perform at a play, though he is chased away by Ryan. After, David solicits the services of a prostitute, an act that makes him recall Soraya and leaves him feeling contented.   
David later returns to Lucy’s farm when Bev tells him there have been “developments.” There, he learns that Lucy is pregnant with a child conceived during the rape and that the youth who raped her, named Pollux, is related to, and now lives with, Petrus. Petrus then offers to marry Lucy, a move she knows is a pretext to take over her land in exchange for his protection. Later, when David sees Pollux peeping on Lucy, he thrashes him, and David’s long-standing, seething racist sentiments spill over. Lucy breaks up the fight, telling David she only wants peace and that he should leave the farm. Days later, now living in his own apartment in town, David visits and silently watches Lucy as she tends her flowers. He considers how she’s grown into a full-fledged adult, her pregnancy, and how life has and will continue to move forward, even after he’s gone. Disgrace concludes at the animal clinic, where David decides to put down a dog he’s bonded with, telling Bev “I am giving him up.”"
Drive,"Starr Carter, a sixteen-year-old black girl, attends a party in her neighborhood, Garden Heights. Starr goes with Kenya, a friend with whom she shares an older half-brother, Seven. Ever since attending Williamson Prep, a primarily white school, Starr feels out of place in the Garden Heights social scene. When Kenya goes off with other friends, Starr runs into her childhood best friend, Khalil Harris, whom she hasn’t seen in a long time. Gunshots from a gang fight interrupt the party, and Khalil offers to take Starr home. While Khalil drives, he explains rapper Tupac Shakur’s idea that “Thug Life” stands for “The Hate U Give Little Infants F---- Everybody.” Soon after, a white police officer with the badge number one-fifteen pulls them over. Khalil questions the motivation for the stop, and One-Fifteen orders him out of the car and searches him. One-Fifteen commands Khalil not to move, and returns to his car. Khalil opens the door to check on Starr. One-Fifteen fatally shoots Khalil.
Starr has nightmares about the death of another childhood friend, Natasha, who died in the crossfire of a gang shooting. At school on Monday, Starr feels tense around Hailey and Chris, her white friend and boyfriend, as memories of Khalil’s death interrupt her thoughts and she realizes they don’t understand. At the urging of her uncle Carlos, a police officer, Starr goes into the police station after school with her mother, Lisa, to testify about Khalil’s shooting. Starr realizes that the officers are asking more questions about whether Khalil was a troublemaker than about the night of the shooting. She worries that justice for Khalil will not be served. At Khalil’s funeral, a lawyer and activist named April Ofrah confirms Starr’s fears when she announces that the police will not pursue legal action against One-Fifteen and invites the attendees to a rally in Khalil’s honor. Starr blames herself for the police’s inaction. King, the head of a local gang called the King Lords, also interrupts the funeral and places a gray bandana on Khalil’s casket, signifying Khalil’s membership in the King Lords. April Ofrah tells Starr to call her if she needs legal representation.
The news that the police won’t prosecute One-Fifteen leads to days of protests in Garden Heights. During this time, Maverick, Starr’s father, explains to her his interpretation of Tupac’s phrase “Thug Life.” He believes that Thug Life describes a system designed against black communities. Only by speaking out can black communities begin to break the cycle. At the Carter family’s grocery store, a teenage member of the King Lords named DeVante begs Maverick, a former King Lord, to help him leave the gang. Maverick agrees. Starr sees DeVante’s request as a chance to help someone in a similar situation as Khalil. A few days later, Maverick gets into an argument with the neighborhood barber, Mr. Lewis. Although the argument is peaceful, two police officers intervene, and when they see Maverick is Starr’s father, they push him to the ground and search him. Between this scary event and pressure from Kenya, Starr decides that she will no longer be silent.
The District Attorney calls Lisa to announce that a grand jury will hear the case against One-Fifteen and asks if Starr will testify. Starr agrees, and April Ofrah decides to represent Starr pro bono, and also find a way to get Starr a television interview. Meanwhile, DeVante tells Starr that Khalil had never been a member of the King Lords and only sold drugs for King to protect his mother, who had stolen money from King. During Starr’s television interview, she decides, against Ms. Ofrah’s advice, to talk about the truth behind Khalil’s drug dealing. Starr’s implication of King enrages him. The night before her grand jury testimony, someone throws a brick and fires a gun into the Carter household. Unsure if the culprits are the King Lords or the police, Starr almost backs out of testifying. However, she ultimately decides that Khalil needs her truth. She testifies before the grand jury.
Almost two months later, the grand jury announces their decision not to indict One-Fifteen. Starr and some of her friends get caught up in the resulting riots. As she tries to avoid the chaos, Starr stumbles upon a protest led by Ms. Ofrah. She offers Starr the megaphone, and Starr leads a chant in front of the protest. The police try to break up the protest with tear gas. Starr and her friends head to the Carter family store to get milk to help heal their eyes. A Molotov cocktail lands in the store, setting it ablaze and trapping them. Maverick arrives just in time to unlock the back door. King arrives to taunt them, proud about getting his revenge. The police arrive, and King, confident that no one will testify against him, claims ignorance. However, the neighbors rally around the Carter family and tell the police that they saw King throw the Molotov cocktail. The police arrest King. Although the grocery store is in ruins, Starr knows that the family will rebuild. She vows to continue fighting for justice on behalf of Khalil and all other black people killed at the hands of police."
Goad,"Two men, Vladimir and Estragon, meet near a tree. They converse on various topics and reveal that they are waiting there for a man named Godot. While they wait, two other men enter. Pozzo is on his way to the market to sell his slave, Lucky. He pauses for a while to converse with Vladimir and Estragon. Lucky entertains them by dancing and thinking, and Pozzo and Lucky leave.
After Pozzo and Lucky leave, a boy enters and tells Vladimir that he is a messenger from Godot. He tells Vladimir that Godot will not be coming tonight, but that he will surely come tomorrow.

The next night, Vladimir and Estragon again meet near the tree to wait for Godot. Lucky and Pozzo enter again, but this time Pozzo is blind and Lucky is dumb. Pozzo does not remember meeting the two men the night before. They leave and Vladimir and Estragon continue to wait.
Shortly after, the boy enters and once again tells Vladimir that Godot will not be coming. He insists that he did not speak to Vladimir yesterday. After he leaves, Estragon and Vladimir decide to leave, but again they do not move as the curtain falls, ending the play."
Relation,"Alex Claremont-Diaz is the 21-year-old son of Ellen Claremont, the first female president of the United States. Alex is highly ambitious, with his sights set on a career in politics like his mother and his father, who is a US senator. Alex is finishing his last year of college and living in the White House with his family, including his older sister June. As the novel opens, June and Alex discuss the British royal wedding, which they are about to attend, and Alex talks about how much he hates the groom’s younger brother, Prince Henry. When Alex was 12, he used to look repeatedly at a photo of Henry from one of June’s teen magazines. But when he met Henry in person, Henry was rude to him, and he’s disliked Henry ever since. At the wedding, Alex is focused on Prince Henry and is irritated by everything he does, especially when he asks June to dance for a photo opportunity. Drunk, Alex confronts Henry for acting superior, and the two end up in a physical altercation that topples the $75,000 royal wedding cake. The international incident is a scandal, and Alex is forced to pretend to be Henry’s close friend to squash rumors of a shaky relationship between the United States and Britain. 
Alex has no choice but to go along with the plan. As Alex and Henry spend more time together, however, Alex is continually surprised by Henry and finds that Henry is not at all what he expected. He’s especially moved when he sees Henry speaking warmly and openly to a young girl with cancer. Before Alex can talk to Henry about it, there’s a loud noise like gunshots, and the two are rushed into a supply closet by security. In the closet, Henry ends up apologizing for mistreating Alex in the past and says he was cold to Alex because his father had just died. Alex and Henry exchange phone numbers and start texting and talking on the phone. The Claremont-Diaz clan has a family dinner, and Ellen offers both Alex and June positions in her reelection campaign. Alex is thrilled, but June, who wants to be a journalist, declines the offer. 
Alex, June, and their best friend Nora, who is the granddaughter of the Vice President, throw their annual New Year’s Eve party. Henry attends with his best friend Pez, who is enamored of June. Everyone is having fun together, but when Henry sees Alex and Nora kiss at midnight, he gets jealous and leaves the party. Alex finds him in the garden, and Henry kisses him for the first time. This spurs a crisis of sexual identity in Alex, who can’t stop thinking about the kiss. Though Alex has had a sexual relationship with his high school friend Liam and been attracted to men, he’s never considered himself bisexual. He talks to Nora about his confusion, and she says that Henry is gay, and that Alex seems to have feelings for Henry. When Henry flies in for a dinner, Alex kisses him while a security guard keeps watch. That night, they have sex for the first time, and Alex says they are friends with benefits. Henry and Alex continue to meet up to have sex when they can get away. They also begin to write flirtatious emails to each other and have heart-to-hearts on the phone. After a night on the town with June, Nora, Henry, Pez, and Henry’s sister Bea, Alex begins to develop feelings for Henry. 
Since Alex's mother is running for reelection and because Henry is a royal, it’s crucial that Henry and Alex’s relationship remain a secret. Alex often turns to his mentor and family friend, Senator Rafael Luna, for advice to help his mother with her campaign. It’s a blow to the whole family when Luna comes out as the running mate for Ellen’s opponent, Jeffrey Richards. Alex is devastated, and Henry comes to visit Alex at the Democratic National Convention to comfort him. The next morning, Zahra, Ellen’s chief of staff and family friend, catches Henry and Alex together and agrees to keep it a secret until after the convention. Alex comes out to his mother, who creates a PowerPoint presentation as a means of talking about the dangers of his relationship with Henry. She tells him she’ll support him, but he needs to be sure the relationship is forever. He goes to his family’s lake house with Henry, June, Nora, and his father Oscar. Alex comes out to his father, too, and he realizes that he is in love with Henry. Just as he’s about to tell Henry how he feels, Henry suddenly becomes formal and fake and leaves the conversation. The next morning Henry leaves the lake house without saying goodbye, leaving only a note. 
When Henry stops responding to Alex’s texts, Alex is distraught. He flies to London to confront Henry. Henry says he can’t be in a relationship with Alex because of the royal family. They have sex, and neither of them is sure whether it is a goodbye or the beginning of their relationship. Henry gives Alex his signet ring and says he wants to be with Alex. They are happy to be together, and they send each other passionate emails when they are apart.
Suspicions about their relationship start coming out in the press, so Alex and Henry pretend to go on dates with Nora and June. It’s painful for Henry to pretend to be someone he isn’t. Then, Akex and Henry's relationship is leaked to the press, with photos of them together and their entire email history. They are both forced to go on a communication blackout, and Ellen’s team attempts to triage the situation. Alex is miserable and worried about Henry. Eventually, he flies to London. Alex and Bea help Henry confront his family, including his grandmother, the Queen. As the Queen argues that the world will never accept them, a group of people gathers outside the palace to express support for Alex and Henry’s love.  
Nora, who has been missing since the news of Alex and Henry’s relationship broke, emerges and reveals that it was the Richards campaign that leaked their photographs and emails. Alex figures out that it was Luna who tipped them off. Alex talks to Luna, and Luna reveals that Richards sexually assaulted him when he was his intern. Luna joined the campaign to expose Richards as a sexual predator. Election night is tense, and in the end, whoever wins Texas, Ellen’s home state, will win the election. Ellen wins, and Henry joins Alex onstage for her victory lap. The two leave the party and go to Alex’s house. Alex shows Henry where he grew up, letting them in with the key he always wears around his neck."
Flows,"Siddhartha, the handsome and respected son of a Brahmin, lives with his father in ancient India. Everyone in the village expects Siddhartha to be a successful Brahmin like his father. Siddhartha enjoys a near-idyllic existence with his best friend, Govinda, but he is secretly dissatisfied. He performs all the rituals of religion, and he does what religion says should bring him happiness and peace. Nonetheless, he feels something is missing. His father and the other elders have still not achieved enlightenment, and he feels that staying with them will not settle the questions he has about the nature of his existence. Siddhartha believes his father has already passed on all the wisdom their community has to offer, but he longs for something more. 
One day, a group of wandering ascetics called Samanas passes through town. They are starved and almost naked and have come to beg for food. They believe enlightenment can be reached through asceticism, a rejection of the body and physical desire. The path the Samanas preach is quite different from the one Siddhartha has been taught, and he believes it may provide some of the answers he is looking for. He decides to follow this new path. Siddhartha’s father does not want him to join the Samanas, but he cannot dissuade Siddhartha. Govinda also wants to find a path to enlightenment, and he joins Siddhartha in this new life.
	Siddhartha adjusts quickly to the ways of the Samanas because of the patience and discipline he learned in the Brahmin tradition. He learns how to free himself from the traditional trappings of life, and so loses his desire for property, clothing, sexuality, and all sustenance except that required to live. His goal is to find enlightenment by eliminating his Self, and he successfully renounces the pleasures of the world. 
Sunburned and half-starved, Siddhartha soon ceases to resemble the boy he used to be. Govinda is quick to praise the Samanas and notes the considerable moral and spiritual improvements they both have achieved since joining. Siddhartha, however, is still dissatisfied. The path of self-denial does not provide a permanent solution for him. He points out that the oldest Samanas have lived the life for many years but have yet to attain true spiritual enlightenment. The Samanas have been as unsuccessful as the Brahmins Siddhartha and Govinda left behind. At this time, Siddhartha and the other Samanas begin to hear about a new holy man named Gotama the Buddha who has attained the total spiritual enlightenment called Nirvana. Govinda convinces Siddhartha they both should leave the Samanas and seek out Gotama. Siddhartha and Govinda inform the leader of the Samanas of their decision to leave. The leader is clearly displeased, but Siddhartha silences him with an almost magical, hypnotizing gaze. 
Siddhartha and Govinda find Gotama’s camp of followers and are taken in. Siddhartha is initially pleased with Gotama, and he and Govinda are instructed in the Eightfold Path, the four main points, and other aspects of Buddhism. However, while Govinda is convinced to join Gotama and his followers, Siddhartha still has doubts. He has noticed a contradiction in Gotama’s teachings: Siddhartha questions how one can embrace the unity of all things, as the Buddha asks, if they are also being told to overcome the physical world. Siddhartha realizes Buddhism will not give him the answers he needs. Sadly, he leaves Govinda behind and begins a search for the meaning of life, the achievement of which he feels will not be dependent on religious instruction. 
	Siddhartha decides to embark on a life free from meditation and the spiritual quests he has been pursuing, and to instead learn from the pleasures of the body and the material world. In his new wanderings, Siddhartha meets a friendly ferryman, fully content with his simple life. Siddhartha crosses the ferryman’s river and comes to a city. Here, a beautiful courtesan named Kamala entrances him. He knows she would be the best one to teach him about the world of love, but Kamala will not have him unless he proves he can fit into the material world. She convinces him to take up the path of the merchant. With her help, Siddhartha soon finds employment with a merchant named Kamaswami and begins to learn the trade. While Siddhartha learns the wisdom of the business world and begins to master the skills Kamaswami teaches him, Kamala becomes his lover and teaches him what she knows about love.
	Years pass, and Siddhartha’s business acumen increases. Soon, he is a rich man and enjoys the benefits of an affluent life. He gambles, drinks, and dances, and anything that can be bought in the material world is his for the taking. Siddhartha is detached from this life, however, and he can never see it as more than a game. He doesn’t care if he wins or loses this game because it doesn’t touch his spirit in any lasting way. The more he obtains in the material world, the less it satisfies him, and he is soon caught in a cycle of unhappiness that he tries to escape by engaging in even more gambling, drinking, and sex. When he is at his most disillusioned, he dreams that Kamala’s rare songbird is dead in its cage. He understands that the material world is slowly killing him without providing him with the enlightenment for which he has been searching. One night, he resolves to leave it all behind and departs without notifying either Kamala or Kamaswami. 
Sick at heart, Siddhartha wanders until he finds a river. He considers drowning himself, but he instead falls asleep on the riverbank. While he is sleeping, Govinda, who is now a Buddhist monk, passes by. Not recognizing Siddhartha, he watches over the sleeping man to protect him from snakes. Siddhartha immediately recognizes Govinda when he wakes up, but Govinda notes that Siddhartha has changed significantly from his days with the Samanas and now appears to be a rich man. Siddhartha responds that he is currently neither a Samana nor a rich man. Siddhartha wishes to become someone new. Govinda soon leaves to continue on his journey, and Siddhartha sits by the river and considers where his life has taken him. 
	Siddhartha seeks out the same content ferryman he met years before. The ferryman, who introduces himself as Vasudeva, radiates an inner peace that Siddhartha wishes to attain. Vasudeva says he himself has attained this sense of peace through many years of studying the river. Siddhartha expresses a desire to likewise learn from the river, and Vasudeva agrees to let Siddhartha live and work beside him. Siddhartha studies the river and begins to take from it a spiritual enlightenment unlike any he has ever known. While sitting by the river, he contemplates the unity of all life, and in the river’s voice he hears the word Om. 

	One day Kamala the courtesan approaches the ferry along with her son on a pilgrimage to visit Gotama, who is said to be dying. Before they can cross, a snake bites Kamala. Siddhartha and Vasudeva tend to Kamala, but the bite kills her. Before she dies, she tells Siddhartha that he is the father of her eleven-year-old son. Siddhartha does his best to console and provide for his son, but the boy is spoiled and cynical. Siddhartha’s son dislikes life with the two ferrymen and wishes to return to his familiar city and wealth. Vasudeva believes Siddhartha’s son should be allowed to leave if he wants to, but Siddhartha is not ready to let him go. One morning, Siddhartha awakens to find his son has run away and stolen all of his and Vasudeva’s money. Siddhartha chases after the boy, but as he reaches the city he realizes the chase is futile. Vasudeva follows Siddhartha and brings him back to their home by the river, instructing him to soothe the pain of losing his son by listening to the river.
	Siddhartha studies the river for many years, and Vasudeva teaches Siddhartha how to learn the many secrets the river has to tell. In contemplating the river, Siddhartha has a revelation: Just as the water of the river flows into the ocean and is returned by rain, all forms of life are interconnected in a cycle without beginning or end. Birth and death are all part of a timeless unity. Life and death, joy and sorrow, good and evil are all parts of the whole and are necessary to understand the meaning of life. By the time Siddhartha has learned all the river’s lessons, Vasudeva announces that he is through with his life at the river. He retires into the forest, leaving Siddhartha to be the ferryman.
	The novel ends with Govinda returning to the river to seek enlightenment by meeting with a wise man who lives there. When Govinda arrives, he does not recognize that the wise man is Siddhartha himself. Govinda is still a follower of Gotama but has yet to attain the kind of enlightenment that Siddhartha now radiates, and he asks Siddhartha to teach him what he knows. Siddhartha explains that neither he nor anyone can teach the wisdom to Govinda, because verbal explanations are limited and can never communicate the entirety of enlightenment. Instead, he asks Govinda to kiss him on the forehead, and when Govinda does, the vision of unity that Siddhartha has experienced is communicated instantly to Govinda. Govinda and Siddhartha have both finally achieved the enlightenment they set out to find in the days of their youth."
Gathered,"A Gathering of Old Men takes place on the Marshall Plantation in Bayonne Louisiana. The plantation's Cajun work boss, Beau Baton, has been murdered just before the novel begins. Candy Marshall, the partial owner and general overseer of the plantation, discovers Beau's dead body outside of Mathu's house. Candy believes that Mathu killed Beau, but as Mathu is virtually her foster father she wants to make every effort to protect him. Candy immediately gathers everyone in the plantation to Mathu's house. When Miss Merle, the mistress of a local plantation arrives, Candy promptly confesses to the murder. Miss Merle does not believe her, but agrees to help. Candy decides that the best course of action would be to bring all the local men to Mathu's house with as many twelve gauge shotguns and empty shells as possible. With numerous men and guns at the crime scene, Candy believes that the local Sheriff will not be able to solve the crime. Miss Merle spreads Candy's plan through the community. Within a few hours, eighteen men have gathered at Mathu's house. All of these men are in their seventies and their eighties, but they have all brought their shotguns and are ready to confess.
In addition to the arrival of the Sheriff, most people at the plantation await the arrival of local Cajun named Fix. Historically, Fix led many lynch mobs against the local blacks. Everyone at the plantation believes that he will soon arrive once again to seek revenge, especially since the murdered man, Beau, is his son. Before anything else happens though, two other men arrive: Lou Dimes, Candy's boyfriend, and Sheriff Mapes. After the Sheriff sees Beau's dead body, he instructs his deputy to find Fix and keep him off the plantation as to avoid a lynching. Candy promptly tells the Sheriff that she committed the murder, but he does not believe her. The Sheriff eyes the old men and decides to question them about the crime.
The first two men that the Sheriff Mapes questions, Billy Washington and Gable, both confess to the murder. When their answers displease him, the Sheriff strikes them each twice. Next, the Sheriff queries the Reverend Jameson to find out what is happening. When the Reverend tells him nothing, the Sheriff punches him so forcibly that the Reverend falls to the ground. The watching men respond by all physically lining up so that the Sheriff can easily hit them all. Their willingness to confess and their indifference to being struck startle the Sheriff. He stops his questioning and thinks about the murder. The Sheriff knows that Charlie, who is not present, works most closely with Beau, but believes that Charlie is too weak to have committed the act. The Sheriff decides that the only culprit could be Mathu because Mathu is the only black man who has ever demonstrated the strength to stand up to local whites. For the Sheriff, Mathu is the only man who is man enough to murder.
Although the Sheriff has a suspect, he cannot arrest anyone because everyone confesses. As the afternoon goes on, many other black men confess to Beau's murder. They explain that they killed Beau because of what they have suffered— a sister raped; a son executed for crime he did not commit; and a brother killed for beating a tractor in a race. Beau died, they explain, for their past sufferings. The Sheriff still believes that Mathu murdered Beau, but can do nothing so everyone just waits to see if Fix Bauton and a lynch mob will show up.
Beau Bauton's brother, Gil, is a star football player on the Louisiana State University team who plays closely with a black halfback named Cal. The two players rely upon one another for their success. Due to their racial combination the press has dubbed them ""Salt and Pepper."" When Gil learns of his brother's murder, he treats Cal coldly. He visits the Marshall Plantation where he sees the gathering of old black men with guns. This sight, and Candy's immediate confession, combined with his brother's death grieves him greatly. Eventually, Gil makes it to home to where his father, Fix Bauton, and others are waiting. Fix, old family friends, and some local racist whites want to revenge Beau's death. Gil begs his father to let justice take its course and argues that the days of lynching are over. Gil refuses to assist his family in violence, citing his desire become an All-American football player. Luke Will, a local ruffian, criticizes Gil's perspective, and so too does Gil's father. Still, Fix will not revenge Beau's death without all of his sons. Without Gil, Fix decides to stay home. Luke Will, on the other hand, is up for the job and gathers some men to help him. They stop first at a local bar to drink some whisky in order to be prepared for the lynching.
Back at the plantation, Sheriff Mapes has found out that Fix is not coming. Mathu peacefully agrees to go to jail. Before they leave however, Charlie returns. Charlie confesses that he killed Beau after Beau threatened him. Charlie then asked Mathu to take the blame and fled. Charlie has spent the day hiding in the swamps, but felt called back to confess and show that he is truly a man.
Before Sheriff Mapes can take Charlie in, Luke Will and his crew arrive. They demand that Mapes hand Charlie over. When Mapes refuses, Luke Will shoots Mapes in the arm. The old black men grab live shotgun shells that they have been hiding in their pockets and start shooting at the whites. Sheriff Mapes remains fallen and injured in Mathu's front yard. The shooting surprises the whites and one of them, Leroy, is lightly injured. As the battle continues, Charlie and Luke Will become the primary fighters, dead set on eliminating the other. Eventually, Charlie rises from his hiding spot and manages to shoot Luke Will before he himself is shot to death. Everyone in the community pays homage to Charlie's dead body.
A trial for all blacks and whites involved in the shooting takes place a week after the event. The judge places everyone on probation for five years. At the trial's end, Mathu disappears with the other black men in a car, while Candy lingers on the courthouse steps with Lou. She grips his hand tightly as the novel closes in a gesture that reaffirms her commitment to their relationship."
Saw,"Rashad and Quinn are both students at Springfield Central High School. They have some friends in common but have never interacted with each other. Rashad is Black, and his father has told him throughout his life about the importance of discipline for young Black men. Rashad’s father joined the army and then the police force before retiring and often tells Rashad that the army is the best opportunity for a Black man to succeed in the United States. Because of this, Rashad is part of the Reserve Officer Training Corps, or ROTC. However, Rashad would rather spend his time drawing and hanging out with his friends English, Shannon, and Carlos. 
Quinn is white, and his father died in Afghanistan. Quinn lives with his mother and his younger brother, Willy, and resents that people expect him to live up to the memory of his father. Quinn’s best friends are Dwyer and Guzzo, who lives across the street. Guzzo’s brother, Paul Galluzzo, is a police officer and has acted as a father figure to Quinn ever since Quinn’s father died. Quinn, Dwyer, and Guzzo are on the basketball team together, along with English.
One Friday, Rashad and Quinn are each planning on going to a party with their friends at Guzzo and Paul’s cousin Jill’s house. Quinn has a crush on Jill. On the way to the party, Rashad stops at Jerry’s Corner Mart to pick up some chips and gum. Jerry’s is always monitored by a police officer as a response to shoplifting incidents at the store. While Rashad is picking out chips, he goes to text his brother, Spoony. His phone is in his bag, so he puts it on the floor and kneels down to take the phone out. While he is kneeling, a woman who was standing behind him backs up and trips over him, causing them both to fall over and Rashad’s chips to slide up the aisle. 
The police officer on duty comes over and asks what happened but assumes Rashad was trying to steal before Rashad or the woman can explain. The police officer drags Rashad outside, handcuffs him, throws him to the ground, and begins beating him. Meanwhile, Quinn and his friends have been waiting in the alley next to Jerry’s to ask an adult to buy them beer that they can take to the party. When Quinn goes around to the front of Jerry’s, he sees what the police officer is doing to Rashad. He recognizes the police officer as Paul Galluzzo. He tells his friends to run and, when they are far enough away, explains what happened and tells Guzzo that he saw his brother. The three decide to go to the party and try to forget about it.
Over the weekend, Rashad wakes up in the hospital with a broken nose and ribs and is told he needs to stay there so the doctors can monitor his internal bleeding. Rashad’s father questions whether Rashad was presenting himself in a way that made him seem dangerous, while Spoony is outraged at the situation. The local news obtains footage of Paul beating Rashad and begins covering the story. The Galluzzo family decides to have a cookout on Sunday, which Quinn and Jill both find strange. Quinn and Jill talk at the cookout about what Paul did to Rashad, while Paul and Guzzo try to intimidate Quinn into not saying anything about what he saw.
At school that week, everyone is talking about what happened to Rashad. Quinn feels conflicted as he has only ever seen the good side of Paul and doesn’t know Rashad. On Tuesday, someone has painted graffiti on the sidewalk in front of the school that says, “Rashad is absent again today.” This message creates a division in the school between those who believe Rashad was innocent and those who believe Paul was just doing his job. When Rashad sees a picture of the graffiti, he knows it is Carlos’s work. 
Spoony and his girlfriend, Berry, plan a protest that coming Friday against the police department. Guzzo continues to question Quinn’s loyalty. At first, Quinn wants to believe that Paul was just trying to do his job, but he just can’t forget what he saw outside Jerry’s. On Thursday, Quinn wears a shirt to school that says, “I’m marching. Are you?” The coach of the basketball team tells the players not to go to the protest and tells Quinn he will call his mother to tell her about his shirt. Quinn’s mother confronts him about the protest, and Quinn says he is standing up for what he believes in, just as his father would have done.
The doctor releases Rashad from the hospital on Thursday, and Rashad plans on joining the protest the following day. On Friday morning, Rashad and Quinn both feel nervous about the protest. Quinn sees a tank-like police vehicle headed toward the school and worries about the protesters’ safety. However, after talking with Jill, he understands that Black people live in fear of police violence every day and that they should put themselves at risk for one day to speak out against this reality. Rashad and Quinn, along with an enormous crowd, march from Jerry’s Corner Mart to the police department, where they stage a die-in as Berry reads aloud the names of unarmed Black people killed by police officers. Rashad and Quinn notice each other during the die-in and feel a connection as they both think of the people on the list and how they will keep fighting for them."
Forest,"It is the fall of 1764, and the relations between white settlers of western Pennsylvania and Indians of the Ohio area are strained. Nevertheless, the ambitious white Colonel Bouquet and his troop of 1,500 men march into Indian country and demand the return of whites who have been kidnapped by the Delaware Indians. True Son, a fifteen-year-old white boy who has been raised by Indians since the age of four, is one of the white prisoners who is going to be returned. True Son loves his Indian way of life and considers himself to be Indian; he has been raised to view whites as enemies and cannot imagine living with them. But although the Indians love their adopted white relatives, they agree to give them back so that they will be able to keep their land. True Son's stoic Indian father, Cuyloga, whom he idolizes, forces his stubborn and resistant son to leave with the white soldiers.
On the trip to Pennsylvania, True Son is placed under the care of Del, a strong white frontiersman who understands the Delaware, or Lenni Lenapi, language since he grew up near Indians. During the march, True Son is very depressed and considers committing suicide by eating the root of a May apple. Del prevents him from doing so and eventually True Son gives up the idea when his Indian cousin, Half Arrow, meets up with the party and walks along with True Son and their friend, Little Crane, whose wife is also among the white captives. The three laugh together and speak of the strange ways of white people until finally True Son must part from his Indian friends and go on to the white settlement.
The company of soldiers and prisoners first passes through Fort Pitt and then moves on to Carlisle, where the white captives are returned to their families. To True Son, white civilization seems like a prison compared to the free and natural world of the Indians. Del, however, sees the stone houses and fences as symbols of the superior white culture. When True Son is introduced to his white father, Harry Butler, he is repulsed by him and states that the man is not his father. In order to help translate for the Butlers and protect them from the potentially violent True Son, Del stays with the Butlers for a little while after True Son's return.
True Son, Del, and Harry Butler travel back to Paxton township where True Son meets more of his family: his mother, Myra, who is sickly; his younger brother, Gordie; and his Aunt Kate. Myra tries to get True Son to communicate with her and say his real name, John Cameron Butler, but True Son is stubborn and refuses to acknowledge that the Butlers are his real family. The only person who does not see True Son's Indian ways as strange and upsetting is Gordie, and a relationship begins to form between the two boys. True Son cannot sleep the night of his return because he remembers the story his Indian father told him about the ""Paxton boys,"" a group of white settlers who brutally murdered some peaceful Conestoga Indians. The next day True Son meets more of his relatives, including his Uncle Wilse, who was a leader of the Paxton boys. Uncle Wilse is suspicious of True Son, and the two have a heated argument about whether the Paxton boys had the right to massacre children, an argument which results in Uncle Wilse slapping True Son across the face.
True Son has a difficult time adjusting to the white culture that is forced upon him. He tries to keep his Indian soul strong and proud, but as time passes and as he loses more and more of his old freedoms, True Son eventually becomes increasingly submissive to his white family. However, just as True Son seems to lose almost all faith in ever seeing Tuscarawas again, his cousin Half Arrow secretly comes to see him one night. True Son sneaks out with his cousin, but their reunion is bittersweet because True Son learns that Little Crane, who had accompanied Half Arrow to Paxton township, was killed by Uncle Wilse the previous night. Little Crane and Half Arrow had come looking for True Son and had told some jokes that Uncle Wilse found offensive. True Son and Half Arrow go to Uncle Wilse's house to demand an explanation, but they end up half-scalping the man and then fleeing into the night.
After spending several weeks together in the wilderness, True Son and Half Arrow return to Tuscarawas, where everyone except for Little Crane's family receives them warmly. Little Crane's brother, Thitpan, calls for war against the whites, and a war party is formed that includes Cuyloga, Half Arrow, True Son, and Little Crane's family. They plan to ambush a boat of white settlers by using True Son to lure them toward the shore. The night before the planned attack, however, True Son is shocked to learn that Thitpan has scalped a young white child. He also has a dream in which his white parents and brother are on the ambushed boat. The day of the attack True Son lures in a boat by calling out for his white ""brothers"" to rescue him from starvation. However, as the boat comes closer True Son sees that there is a boy Gordie's age on the boat. He becomes frightened that Gordie may be on the boat and ruins the ambush attempt. Although Little Crane's family votes to burn True Son for his betrayal, Cuyloga saves his son from death with a very moving speech. True Son's action, however, means that he must leave the Indians forever and can no longer be Cuyloga's son. The next day Cuyloga takes True Son to a point in the woods where they part forever, and True Son continues on, alone."
Expand,"Lawyer Bryan Stevenson gives a first-person account of his decades helping marginalized Americans who have been unfairly and harshly punished by the U.S. criminal justice system, which disproportionately targets people of color and poor people. At the heart of Just Mercy is the story of Walter McMillian, a Black man who was framed for the murder of a girl named Ronda Morrison, convicted, and sent to death row. 
Stevenson alternates chapters about Walter with his personal reflections on our country’s history with racial disparity and issues around incarceration. Stevenson highlights other groups of vulnerable people who have been victimized by the criminal justice system and shares the stories of the prisoners he has helped over the years. The book also follows the growth of Stevenson’s nonprofit law project, the Alabama-based Equal Justice Initiative (EJI), through its expansion from focusing on death row prisoners to helping people sentenced to life without parole. Stevenson chronicles how EJI becomes a significant force in criminal justice reform.
In 1983 as a law student, Stevenson discovers his life’s passion when he interns with the Georgia-based Southern Prisoners Defense Committee and meets his first death row prisoner. After graduation Stevenson accepts a job with the organization to represent poor prisoners, including those in Alabama who lack any public defender. He meets Walter McMillian on Alabama’s death row. Walter owns a successful business but also transgresses racial boundaries when he has an affair with a white woman. Soon after the affair becomes public, the woman’s friend, Ralph Myers, accuses Walter of committing the unsolved murder of Ronda Morrison, which has outraged the community. Law enforcement, including a racist sheriff and the district attorney, eagerly pounces on this accusation, overlooking Walter’s alibi and a lack of evidence. Instead, they actively force Ralph to stick with his story even when he tries to recant. They coerce other false witness testimonies, and—as revealed years later—actively suppress evidence.
After Stevenson and the team at EJI unsuccessfully appeal Walter’s conviction, they launch their own investigation of the crime and uncover new evidence. They find witnesses who can prove the witnesses against Walter lied as well as financial records that indicate that one of these witnesses was paid to give false testimony. Stevenson and his team also petition for and receive all records from Walter’s trial. However, their big break comes when they receive a phone call from Ralph, who now wants to make amends. Ralph admits to lying about Walter and says he was threatened by law enforcement. Stevenson wins a hearing for Walter where he can present his new evidence: Ralph’s testimony, which is confirmed by health care workers and other inmates, as well as recordings of the law enforcement team threatening Ralph if he doesn’t frame Walter. 
While the judge refuses to grant Walter relief, Stevenson continues the appeal process through the Alabama courts. The district attorney asks outside agents to investigate the murder for which Walter was convicted, and the investigators determine that Walter had nothing to do with the crime. Six weeks later, the court invalidates Walter’s conviction. Stevenson and the State file a joint motion to dismiss the charges, and Walter is set free.
Throughout the process, Stevenson and Walter become close friends, and Stevenson helps Walter upon his release, including filing a civil suit on his behalf and offering him a place to stay. Walter works with Stevenson to share his story, giving interviews and speaking at legal conferences, and Walter is even featured in a documentary. Unfortunately, Walter is diagnosed with advancing dementia and is forced to rely on family and eventually a nursing facility for his care. He dies in 2013. Stevenson gives a eulogy at his funeral and shares all he learned from Walter, particularly that we must extend mercy to everyone, even those who have not earned it.
Interspersed with chapters chronicling Walter’s narrative are stories of Stevenson’s other clients and work. His closeness with these prisoners and their horrifying circumstances makes Stevenson more determined to help and causes him to reflect on abstract issues that nevertheless imbue the criminal justice system, like humanity and mercy. Stevenson focuses on several categories of vulnerable people who become trapped in the system, including mentally ill prisoners, disabled prisoners, and poor women who give birth to stillborn babies. 
Stevenson and his team at EJI also become increasingly focused on juvenile offenders who are sometimes tried as adults despite their young age. These offenders may be given de facto death sentences by being sentenced to life without parole and face perilous circumstances when they are housed in adult prisons. Stevenson illustrates how these prisoners retain their own humanity while being forced to live under inhumane conditions. He also discusses some of the qualities common among these types of prisoners: They are generally poor and disproportionately people of color, and most of them lack adequate legal counsel. The juveniles have horrific backgrounds of abuse and neglect.
Stevenson and his team at EJI also work to change the legal system to offer more protection to marginalized people. Several of his cases end up before the U.S. Supreme Court, and he succeeds in winning rulings that ban as unconstitutional the conviction of children to life without parole and the execution of people deemed incompetent from dementia or neurological disease. EJI works to raise public awareness of issues surrounding unfair incarceration, produces groundbreaking reports on racial issues, and sets up programs to help formerly incarcerated people adjust to life on the outside.
Stevenson also reflects on the issues that surround the criminal justice system. His time spent with prisoners awaiting their execution makes him realize how inhumane it is to prepare another human to die. After decades of work, when Stevenson fails to prevent the execution of a man who suffers from an intellectual disability, he momentarily feels unable to continue his work. However, he realizes that he cannot help but be broken by his experiences and comes to understand that it is his own brokenness that allows him to more fully understand the need for mercy and to bring compassion to others. The book ends with Stevenson’s renewed commitment to helping others."
Paths,"The story takes place on a cold December day. It begins as a very old, small Black woman named Phoenix Jackson sets out along a path through the woods. She walks slowly and with a sense of great labor. As a result of her failing vision, she uses a cane made from an umbrella to feel out the ground in front of her. She wears a striped dress with large skirts, an apron made from recycled sugar bags, and a red rag on her head. She’s dressed neatly but her shoes are untied.
As she makes her slow, laborious way down the path, she begins to speak aloud to any wild animals that may be out and about, warning them to stay away from her, to leave her path clear. There’s a sense, as she makes this declaration, that she may have previously encountered wild animals that slowed her progress. The path comes to a hill and Phoenix reflects that, whenever she faces the hill, it always presents a formidable obstacle, one that tempts her to stop her journey. She continues on anyway, as she has, it seems, time and time again.
Once she reaches the bottom of the hill, her dress catches on a thorny bush which she mistakes for a green bush because of her vision difficulties. She takes time to disentangle her skirts from the thorns, and her progress is slow and frustrated. She can’t afford to tear her dress. Finally free, she reflects on how high the sun has gotten in the sky and worries about the time.
Phoenix’s next obstacle is a log laid across the creek. With her eyes closed, she uses her cane to navigate and lets her feet march her across successfully. She’s relieved to pass but still sits down to rest. There, on the bank of the creek, she has her first dream vision. A little boy comes up to her and offers her a slice of marble-cake, but when she goes to reach for it, she finds there is nothing there. 
Next, Phoenix must crawl through a barbed-wire fence on her hands and knees without tearing her dress or hurting her body. She talks to herself as she passes, telling herself she must be successful. She is. She continues on through a cotton field, dead in the winter, and is thankful for the season because there are no bulls or snakes. She reflects on a two-headed snake that delayed her journey in the summer.

She sees what she thinks may be a tall, slender Black man or maybe a ghost in the field. She approaches it and reaches out her hand to investigate because she has trouble seeing. When she realizes it’s just a scarecrow, she is relieved. She tells the scarecrow to dance, and she dances a little with it.
She reaches the place she calls “the easy place” and stoops for a drink of water. She’s grateful that the alligators are sleeping. She then is surprised by a big black dog, and when she tries to defend herself against him, she falls into a ditch. There she has her second dream vision, and she reaches her hand up and finds that there’s nothing reaching back to help her up. She lays in the ditch and talks to herself until a young white hunter comes along.
He helps her out of the ditch, laughing at her predicament. He makes sure she’s physically okay and tells her she should go back home because the journey she’s making is a long one, even for him. Because she’s an old Black woman, he assumes she’s making the long trip to town to see Santa Claus.
Phoenix sees a nickel fall out of the man’s pocket. Slyly, she goads him into getting his dog to chase off the black dog that knocked her in the ditch. While the hunter is occupied with the dogs, Phoenix slowly leans down, grasps the nickel, and puts it into the pocket of her apron. 
When the hunter returns, he points his gun at her and asks her if she’s scared. She says she isn’t, that she’s seen many guns go off much closer to her for less serious offenses than her theft. He puts his gun down, resumes his friendly demeanor, and tells her again that he thinks she should go home. She continues on her way, but she can hear the hunter’s gun going off in the distance.
The shadows on the oak trees tell her that time is passing. She smells wood smoke and the river, hears bells ringing, and sees the town of Natchez in the distance. It is decked out with lights and decorations for Christmas. Phoenix trusts her feet to lead the way because her eyesight is failing her.
She passes a woman on the sidewalk and asks her to tie her shoelaces. She’s concerned about appearing disheveled now that she has reached the town. The woman is brusque with Phoenix, but she puts her many shopping bags down and ties Phoenix’s shoelaces for her.
Phoenix arrives at a big building and sees a plaque that matches one she has dreamed of. As soon as she has arrived at her destination, exhaustion hits Phoenix. She encounters an attendant, who guesses that Phoenix is a charity case, but Phoenix is silent, sweating, and still. The attendant expresses frustration at Phoenix’s silence. A nurse who recognizes Phoenix arrives and tells the attendant her story: Phoenix’s grandson has been sick for a few years after drinking some lye, which damaged his throat. Phoenix comes to town all the time to get medicine for him.
Phoenix has remained silent throughout the visit. The nurse begins to question her with increasing intensity and irritation. When she asks if Phoenix’s grandson is dead, Phoenix begins to come back to life. She admits that she forgot why she made her long journey. She is apologetic, explaining that she never went to school because she was too old to attend by the time slavery ended. She says her memory sometimes fails her. 
She explains that her grandson’s condition is the same as it has been, and he needs her help because his throat closes up. The medicine she fetches for him, that the doctor donates to her out of charity, makes it so her grandson can breathe and swallow. She explains to the nurse how much she loves her grandson and that even though her memory fails, she always recognizes him.
The nurse becomes impatient again and gives her the medicine, noting that it’s given as charity. Phoenix thanks the nurse and the attendant offers her a few pennies. Phoenix points out that there are five pennies in a nickel, and the attendant gives her a nickel, which she adds to the one she pinched from the hunter. She looks at the two nickels and tells the white women that she’s going to buy a paper windmill as a gift for her grandson so he can see what kind of wonders there are in the world."
Bounties,"A catastrophic world war has left Earth radioactive and barely habitable. Animal life has nearly been wiped out. To encourage people to move to other planets, the U.N. supplies each emigrant with a lifelike android servant. Most people have taken the offer, but a few remain on Earth. The “regulars” can marry and travel freely. The “specials” (people who are damaged by radiation) are not allowed to reproduce or to leave Earth. Ownership of an animal is a status symbol. Some people own real ones, but others have to settle for lifelike fakes. Both regulars and specials participate in a ritual called fusion, which involves “empathy boxes” and a mysterious figure named Mercer. Through fusion, people share in Mercer’s physical sufferings and also transmit feelings to one another. Those who come to the ritual happy leave sadder, weighed down by others’ burdens. Those who enter the ritual sad have their spirits boosted by others’ happiness. The beliefs and moral teachings associated with this practice are called Mercerism.
Out on the colony planets, life is much less pleasant than advertised back on Earth. The android servants find their existence especially bleak. Some of them murder their owners and escape back to Earth, where the androids try to pass for human beings. Police departments employ bounty hunters to hunt these androids down and kill them. Before killing an android, however, a bounty hunter must use a psychological test to confirm that the target is an android. The test is believed to be reliable, but with each new model, androids are getting harder and harder to distinguish from real people. 
Rick Deckard is a bounty hunter attached to the San Francisco Police Department. One morning, he learns that a colleague was badly injured by an android. This android, plus five others on the colleague’s list, are now assigned to Rick. Rick looks forward to earning several bounties, and he starts thinking about which animal he will buy to surprise his wife. Before he can go after the androids, however, his boss orders him to visit the headquarters of Rosen Association, the manufacturer of the most realistic androids. Rick must confirm that the test to identify androids still works. 
At Rosen headquarters, Rick meets Rachael, supposedly the assistant and niece of the company president. Rick does not realize that Rachael and her uncle intend to derail Rick’s android-hunting. First, Rick is asked to use his test to decide whether Rachael is android or human. When Rachael tests as an android, the uncle persuades Rick that the test is wrong and therefore unreliable. This is a serious obstacle to any further android-hunting. Rick figures out, however, that Rachael truly is an android. Later, Rachael offers to help Rick hunt androids; being one herself, she should have useful insights into their thoughts and behavior. Rick refuses the offer. The androids he goes after use elaborate tricks to evade capture, but he persists. By the time he heads home from work, he has killed three androids and has used the bounty money to buy his wife a goat. He plans to resume the hunt the next day, but his boss calls and orders him to the location of the last three androids that same evening.
Rick changes his mind and asks Rachael for assistance. When Rick and Rachael are together, however, she seduces him. This is a tactic: nearly all other bounty hunters she slept with lost their zeal for android-hunting afterward. Rick, however, turns out to be one of the exceptions. He sends Rachael away and proceeds to his confrontation with the last three androids. They have been hiding out in the apartment of John Isidore, a special. One of the androids, Pris, is a duplicate of Rachael. Isidore is infatuated with her and in awe of android intelligence. This is the reason he is helping Pris and her two companions even though they treat him poorly. When Rick arrives, Mercer appears and warns him that Pris is lying in wait. Rick is caught off guard by Pris’s resemblance to Rachael, but he recovers and kills her. He then kills the other two androids more easily.
Rick’s hunt is over, but he feels empty and defeated. Mercerism, it was announced on TV last night, is an elaborate hoax. Rachael has taken revenge on him by killing the goat. Rick flies northward in his hovercar for hundreds of miles and sets the car down on a rocky hillside. Despondent and sleep-deprived, he experiences fusion with Mercer, even though he has no empathy box with him, and even though Mercer is supposedly not real. Rick spots a toad on the ground. Toads are listed as extinct, but against all odds Rick has stumbled on one in the wild. Excitedly, he brings the toad back to his wife. She discovers that it is only an electric toad replica, but she is grateful for the gesture. After Rick’s wife tucks him into bed for some much-needed sleep, she orders some supplies to care for the toad."
World,"The novel opens in the Central London Hatching and Conditioning Centre, where the Director of the Hatchery and one of his assistants, Henry Foster, are giving a tour to a group of boys. The boys learn about the Bokanovsky and Podsnap Processes that allow the Hatchery to produce thousands of nearly identical human embryos. During the gestation period the embryos travel in bottles along a conveyor belt through a factorylike building, and are conditioned to belong to one of five castes: Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, or Epsilon. The Alpha embryos are destined to become the leaders and thinkers of the World State. Each of the succeeding castes is conditioned to be slightly less physically and intellectually impressive. The Epsilons, stunted and stupefied by oxygen deprivation and chemical treatments, are destined to perform menial labor. Lenina Crowne, an employee at the factory, describes to the boys how she vaccinates embryos destined for tropical climates.
The Director then leads the boys to the Nursery, where they observe a group of Delta infants being reprogrammed to dislike books and flowers. The Director explains that this conditioning helps to make Deltas docile and eager consumers. He then tells the boys about the “hypnopaedic” (sleep-teaching) methods used to teach children the morals of the World State. In a room where older children are napping, a whispering voice is heard repeating a lesson in “Elementary Class Consciousness.”
Outside, the Director shows the boys hundreds of naked children engaged in sexual play and games like “Centrifugal Bumble-puppy.” Mustapha Mond, one of the ten World Controllers, introduces himself to the boys and begins to explain the history of the World State, focusing on the State’s successful efforts to remove strong emotions, desires, and human relationships from society. Meanwhile, inside the Hatchery, Lenina chats in the bathroom with Fanny Crowne about her relationship with Henry Foster. Fanny chides Lenina for going out with Henry almost exclusively for four months, and Lenina admits she is attracted to the strange, somewhat funny-looking Bernard Marx. In another part of the Hatchery, Bernard is enraged when he overhears a conversation between Henry and the Assistant Predestinator about “having” Lenina.
After work, Lenina tells Bernard that she would be happy to accompany him on the trip to the Savage Reservation in New Mexico to which he had invited her. Bernard, overjoyed but embarrassed, flies a helicopter to meet a friend of his, Helmholtz Watson. He and Helmholtz discuss their dissatisfaction with the World State. Bernard is primarily disgruntled because he is too small and weak for his caste; Helmholtz is unhappy because he is too intelligent for his job writing hypnopaedic phrases. In the next few days, Bernard asks his superior, the Director, for permission to visit the Reservation. The Director launches into a story about a visit to the Reservation he had made with a woman twenty years earlier. During a storm, he tells Bernard, the woman was lost and never recovered. Finally, he gives Bernard the permit, and Bernard and Lenina depart for the Reservation, where they get another permit from the Warden. Before heading into the Reservation, Bernard calls Helmholtz and learns that the Director has grown weary of what he sees as Bernard’s difficult and unsocial behavior and is planning to exile Bernard to Iceland when he returns. Bernard is angry and distraught, but decides to head into the Reservation anyway.
On the Reservation, Lenina and Bernard are shocked to see its aged and ill residents; no one in the World State has visible signs of aging. They witness a religious ritual in which a young man is whipped, and find it abhorrent. After the ritual they meet John, a fair-skinned young man who is isolated from the rest of the village. John tells Bernard about his childhood as the son of a woman named Linda who was rescued by the villagers some twenty years ago. Bernard realizes that Linda is almost certainly the woman mentioned by the Director. Talking to John, he learns that Linda was ostracized because of her willingness to sleep with all the men in the village, and that as a result John was raised in isolation from the rest of the village. John explains that he learned to read using a book called The Chemical and Bacteriological Conditioning of the Embryo and The Complete Works of Shakespeare, the latter given to Linda by one of her lovers, Popé. John tells Bernard that he is eager to see the “Other Place”—the “brave new world” that his mother has told him so much about. Bernard invites him to return to the World State with him. John agrees but insists that Linda be allowed to come as well.
While Lenina, disgusted with the Reservation, takes enough soma to knock her out for eighteen hours, Bernard flies to Santa Fe where he calls Mustapha Mond and receives permission to bring John and Linda back to the World State. Meanwhile, John breaks into the house where Lenina is lying intoxicated and unconscious, and barely suppresses his desire to touch her. Bernard, Lenina, John, and Linda fly to the World State, where the Director is waiting to exile Bernard in front of his Alpha coworkers. But Bernard turns the tables by introducing John and Linda. The shame of being a “father”—the very word makes the onlookers laugh nervously—causes the Director to resign, leaving Bernard free to remain in London.
John becomes a hit with London society because of his strange life led on the Reservation. But while touring the factories and schools of the World State, John becomes increasingly disturbed by the society that he sees. His sexual attraction to Lenina remains, but he desires more than simple lust, and he finds himself terribly confused. In the process, he also confuses Lenina, who wonders why John does not wish to have sex with her. As the discoverer and guardian of the “Savage,” Bernard also becomes popular. He quickly takes advantage of his new status, sleeping with many women and hosting dinner parties with important guests, most of whom dislike Bernard but are willing to placate him if it means they get to meet John. One night John refuses to meet the guests, including the Arch-Community Songster, and Bernard’s social standing plummets.
After Bernard introduces them, John and Helmholtz quickly take to each other. John reads Helmholtz parts of Romeo and Juliet, but Helmholtz cannot keep himself from laughing at a serious passage about love, marriage, and parents—ideas that are ridiculous, almost scatological in World State culture.
Fueled by his strange behavior, Lenina becomes obsessed with John, refusing Henry’s invitation to see a feely. She takes soma and visits John at Bernard’s apartment, where she hopes to seduce him. But John responds to her advances with curses, blows, and lines from Shakespeare. She retreats to the bathroom while he fields a phone call in which he learns that Linda, who has been on permanent soma-holiday since her return, is about to die. At the Hospital for the Dying he watches her die while a group of lower-caste boys receiving their “death conditioning” wonder why she is so unattractive. The boys are simply curious, but John becomes enraged. After Linda dies, John meets a group of Delta clones who are receiving their soma ration. He tries to convince them to revolt, throwing the soma out the window, and a riot results. Bernard and Helmholtz, hearing of the riot, rush to the scene and come to John’s aid. After the riot is calmed by police with soma vapor, John, Helmholtz, and Bernard are arrested and brought to the office of Mustapha Mond.
John and Mond debate the value of the World State’s policies, John arguing that they dehumanize the residents of the World State and Mond arguing that stability and happiness are more important than humanity. Mond explains that social stability has required the sacrifice of art, science, and religion. John protests that, without these things, human life is not worth living. Bernard reacts wildly when Mond says that he and Helmholtz will be exiled to distant islands, and he is carried from the room. Helmholtz accepts the exile readily, thinking it will give him a chance to write, and soon follows Bernard out of the room. John and Mond continue their conversation. They discuss religion and the use of soma to control negative emotions and social harmony.
John bids Helmholtz and Bernard good-bye. Refused the option of following them to the islands by Mond, he retreats to a lighthouse in the countryside where he gardens and attempts to purify himself by self-flagellation. Curious World State citizens soon catch him in the act, and reporters descend on the lighthouse to film news reports and a feely. After the feely, hordes of people descend on the lighthouse and demand that John whip himself. Lenina comes and approaches John with her arms open. John reacts by brandishing his whip and screaming “Kill it! Kill it!” The intensity of the scene causes an orgy in which John takes part. The next morning he wakes up and, overcome with anger and sadness at his submission to World State society, hangs himself."
Incomes,"In Outliers: The Story of Success, Malcolm Gladwell considers the circumstances that lead to success. The first half of the book looks closely at how opportunities matter more in the lives of successful people than hard work or raw talent. The second half of the book focuses on cultural legacies: behavioral tendencies rooted in their ancestral past.
Part One examines the role of opportunity in the lives of extremely successful people. Gladwell’s first example is the Canadian Hockey League, the world’s most competitive youth hockey league. Since the cutoff date for the Canadian leagues that serve the youngest players is January 1, those born in the first part of the calendar year are much larger and more coordinated than their peers. The larger and more coordinated kids are given more playing time and better coaching, and thus become better players by the time they reach the top league. An overwhelming majority of Canadian professional hockey players have birthdays in January, February or March.
Gladwell proposes that 10,000 hours of practice is needed to master a skill, even for prodigies like Mozart. Bill Joy, Bill Gates, and the Beatles all worked hard to achieve success but benefited from opportunities they did not create. Joy, one of the founders of Sun Microsystems, happened to attend one of the first colleges in the world with a time-sharing terminal. In graduate school, he had a terminal in his room, where he spent all of his free time programming. Gates happened to attend a private high school with a time-sharing terminal connected to a mainframe in Seattle. He also was able to spend all of his free time programming. Early on, the Beatles were hired to play long shows day after day in Hamburg, Germany. 
Birth year or era is another form of opportunity. Gates and Joy (as well as other early programmers) all reached the end of their teen years just as personal computers became available to the public. In another example, fourteen of the top seventy-five richest people in the history of the world happened to be alive at the same time, in the same country: the United States in the mid-1800s.
Opportunity matters more than an individual’s IQ. Using a study conducted by Lewis Terman, the creator of the Stanford-Binet IQ test, Gladwell shows that “practical intelligence” is as important as “analytical intelligence.” He also contrasts Chris Langan, one of the world’s smartest living people, with Robert Oppenheimer. While both had difficulties in college, only Oppenheimer had a successful life, due to his practical intelligence.
The last portion of Part One looks at Joe Flom, a successful lawyer from New York City. While he was born into a poor family to Jewish immigrants (in a time when Jewish immigrants were not treated well), many of the disadvantages in his life were actually benefits and directly contributed to his success.
Part Two investigates cultural legacies. Using flight recorder transcripts from several plane crashes from the last few decades, Gladwell shows that cultural expectations and habits can be a severe hindrance to pilots. Copilots from countries that have a high “Power Distance Index” (those that show the most deference to authority) will often avoid telling pilots that they are making mistakes, even when the mistakes are potentially fatal. After recognizing the dangers of such cultural expectations, commercial aviation has instituted programs to change the way flight crews talk with one another. 
Gladwell next analyzes the disparity in public school math test scores between Eastern and Western countries. He suggests that the cultures in which rice paddy farming is historically important have a stronger work ethic. Using various examples, Gladwell shows that hard work has a greater impact on success in learning mathematics than intelligence. 
The final example is an examination of the KIPP school in the South Bronx and the “achievement gap” between socioeconomic groups. American students from middle-class and affluent households retain more information over summer vacation and are more likely to make additional gains than students from low-income households. The KIPP school uses longer school days and summer programming to eliminate the achievement gap for low-income children. While the work schedule is very rigorous, the school’s students go on to great academic success.
Gladwell demonstrates that if more opportunities were available, there would be far more successful people and the world would be richer for it."
Oar,"The Old Man and the Sea is the story of an epic struggle between an old, seasoned fisherman and the greatest catch of his life. For eighty-four days, Santiago, an aged Cuban fisherman, has set out to sea and returned empty-handed. So conspicuously unlucky is he that the parents of his young, devoted apprentice and friend, Manolin, have forced the boy to leave the old man in order to fish in a more prosperous boat. Nevertheless, the boy continues to care for the old man upon his return each night. He helps the old man tote his gear to his ramshackle hut, secures food for him, and discusses the latest developments in American baseball, especially the trials of the old man’s hero, Joe DiMaggio. Santiago is confident that his unproductive streak will soon come to an end, and he resolves to sail out farther than usual the following day.
On the eighty-fifth day of his unlucky streak, Santiago does as promised, sailing his skiff far beyond the island’s shallow coastal waters and venturing into the Gulf Stream. He prepares his lines and drops them. At noon, a big fish, which he knows is a marlin, takes the bait that Santiago has placed one hundred fathoms deep in the waters. The old man expertly hooks the fish, but he cannot pull it in. Instead, the fish begins to pull the boat.
Unable to tie the line fast to the boat for fear the fish would snap a taut line, the old man bears the strain of the line with his shoulders, back, and hands, ready to give slack should the marlin make a run. The fish pulls the boat all through the day, through the night, through another day, and through another night. It swims steadily northwest until at last it tires and swims east with the current. The entire time, Santiago endures constant pain from the fishing line. Whenever the fish lunges, leaps, or makes a dash for freedom, the cord cuts Santiago badly. Although wounded and weary, the old man feels a deep empathy and admiration for the marlin, his brother in suffering, strength, and resolve.
On the third day the fish tires, and Santiago, sleep-deprived, aching, and nearly delirious, manages to pull the marlin in close enough to kill it with a harpoon thrust. Dead beside the skiff, the marlin is the largest Santiago has ever seen. He lashes it to his boat, raises the small mast, and sets sail for home. While Santiago is excited by the price that the marlin will bring at market, he is more concerned that the people who will eat the fish are unworthy of its greatness.
As Santiago sails on with the fish, the marlin’s blood leaves a trail in the water and attracts sharks. The first to attack is a great mako shark, which Santiago manages to slay with the harpoon. In the struggle, the old man loses the harpoon and lengths of valuable rope, which leaves him vulnerable to other shark attacks. The old man fights off the successive vicious predators as best he can, stabbing at them with a crude spear he makes by lashing a knife to an oar, and even clubbing them with the boat’s tiller. Although he kills several sharks, more and more appear, and by the time night falls, Santiago’s continued fight against the scavengers is useless. They devour the marlin’s precious meat, leaving only skeleton, head, and tail. Santiago chastises himself for going “out too far,” and for sacrificing his great and worthy opponent. He arrives home before daybreak, stumbles back to his shack, and sleeps very deeply.
The next morning, a crowd of amazed fishermen gathers around the skeletal carcass of the fish, which is still lashed to the boat. Knowing nothing of the old man’s struggle, tourists at a nearby café observe the remains of the giant marlin and mistake it for a shark. Manolin, who has been worried sick over the old man’s absence, is moved to tears when he finds Santiago safe in his bed. The boy fetches the old man some coffee and the daily papers with the baseball scores, and watches him sleep. When the old man wakes, the two agree to fish as partners once more. The old man returns to sleep and dreams his usual dream of lions at play on the beaches of Africa."
Splendid,"A Thousand Splendid Suns is divided into four parts. Part 1 tells the story of Mariam, a young girl born in Afghanistan in the 1950s. Part 2 describes the early life of Laila, who was born in Kabul in the late 1970’s. The lives of the two women intersect in Part 3. Part 4 is from Laila’s perspective. Throughout the story, global and regional power struggles bring chaos and destruction to both women’s lives, and to the country of Afghanistan.
Mariam spends the first fifteen years of her life living with her mother, Nana, in a small kolba (shack) built for them by Mariam’s father, Jalil. Nana and Jalil were not married when Nana became pregnant with Mariam, and Nana often reminds Mariam that she is a harami, an illegitimate child. Jalil visits Mariam weekly, and Mariam longs to be accepted by her father as his other children are. Mariam has one dear friend, Mullah Faizullah, the town tutor. He teaches Mariam from the Koran and cares for Mariam like family. On Mariam’s fifteenth birthday, Jalil does not fulfill his promise to take her to the cinema. It is Mariam’s one wish to be seen around town with her father. When Jalil does not arrive, Mariam leaves her home to find him. Mariam is turned away from her father’s home. When she is taken back to her kolba, Mariam discovers that Nana has hung herself. 
Mariam feels responsible for Nana’s death. When Mariam asked Jalil to take her to see “Pinocchio,” Nana begged Mariam not to leave her alone. Mullah Faizullah tries to comfort Mariam, by visiting her as much as he can. Jalil’s wives soon tell Mariam that she is to be married. Mariam begs her father not to send her away, but Jalil’s decision has already been made. Mariam is married to Rasheed, a shoemaker nearly thirty years older than Mariam. When Jalil sends Mariam to Kabul to live with her new husband, Mariam tells Jalil she never wishes to see him again.
Rasheed’s Islamic beliefs are fundamentalist, and he expects Mariam to keep house, respect her husband, and cover herself when she leaves their home. Kabul is a confusing place for Mariam. While Mariam wears a burqa in public, she sees other women wearing makeup and high heels. Within a few years, Mariam becomes pregnant, and Rasheed prays for a boy. Fariba, a woman from Rasheed’s neighborhood, discovers Mariam bleeding. Rasheed takes Mariam to the hospital, and a doctor confirms that Mariam has had a miscarriage. Soon, Rasheed’s critical attitude toward his wife turns abusive.
In 1978, the political environment in Afghanistan is chaotic. The communist party gains power and eventually overthrows the Afghan government and executes its president. Fariba’s daughter, Laila, is born during this revolution.
Laila has never known her brothers, Ahmad and Noor. The two young men are members of the Afghan resistance fighting against the communist rule of Soviet Russia. Laila’s Mammy is often unwell, in bed, and finds fault with her husband. Hakim, whom Laila calls Babi, is a teacher at the university in Kabul. Babi is tender with Laila and patient with Mammy. When Laila’s family is informed of her brother’s deaths, Mammy is despondent. Laila feels guilty for not grieving as deeply as Mammy. Laila cares more for her dearest friend, Tariq, than she does for her brothers.
Tariq, just a few years older than Laila, is kind to her and a fierce protector. Even though Tariq has lost a leg, he fights neighborhood boys when they bully Laila. As they grow older, Laila becomes more aware of the gossip that surrounds her friendship with Tariq. Though Laila worries about her reputation, she allows her relationship with Tariq to become intimate. By 1992, Laila is fourteen. Communist forces in Afghanistan have been overthrown, and the city of Kabul becomes a battleground for rival warlords. When Tariq tells Laila that his family is leaving Afghanistan, Laila is overcome. The young couple sleep together, even though they have been taught that this is a sin against Allah. Laila refuses to go with Tariq; she will not leave her parents behind. 
Babi finally convinces Mammy to leave Kabul, even though it is Mammy’s dearest wish to see her sons’ cause prevail. As Laila is packing, a rocket hits their home, leaving Mammy and Babi dead and Laila gravely injured.
Rasheed pulls Laila from the rubble, and Mariam nurses Laila back to health. Laila receives a visit from a man named Abdul Sharif. The stranger tells Laila that he spent time in a hospital with Tariq before Tariq died. Laila is heartbroken, and believes Allah is punishing her for not grieving her brothers properly. Rasheed proposes to Laila, and Laila accepts because she is pregnant with Tariq’s child. Laila knows that she has no other choice. Rasheed and Laila are married. Soon, Laila tells Rasheed that she is having his child, and Rasheed once more prays for a son. Again, he is disappointed. Mariam sees how cruel Rasheed is to Laila and her infant daughter, Aziza. Mariam’s once hostile attitude toward Laila grows into fondness. Aziza and Mariam develop a special relationship. 
Rasheed’s cruelty toward the women in his family is tolerated under the new Shari’a law, enforced by the new Taliban regime. Rasheed is now sure that Tariq is Aziza’s real father, and Rasheed uses this secret to keep Laila in line. Mariam and Laila attempt to take the children and leave Rasheed, but the women and children are caught. Under the Taliban, it is illegal for women to run away from the husbands. Rasheed beats Laila and Mariam for trying to leave, and he threatens them with worse if they try again.
Laila does eventually give Rasheed a son, Zalmai. Rasheed spoils his son, and he continues mistreating his wives and Aziza. Rasheed is foolish with his money. When he loses his job, Rasheed forces Laila to put Aziza in an orphanage. Though it is illegal for women to leave their homes without a male family member, Laila visits Aziza as often as she can. She must avoid the Taliban forces, who beat her when they catch her alone. One day, Laila receives a visitor of her own. Tariq is not dead. He has come to take Mariam with him back to Pakistan. Mariam realizes that Rasheed paid a friend to make up the story about Tariq’s death, in order to convince Laila to marry Rasheed.
Zalmai tells his father that Laila had a male visitor. Rasheed is furious, and Mariam sees that he will kill Laila. Mariam beats Rasheed with a shovel until he is dead. Mariam knows she will not live after committing this crime, and she sends Laila and the children away with Tariq. Mariam confesses to murdering her husband, and she is sentenced to death. 
Laila and Tariq take the children to Pakistan, and the two are married. Aziza bonds quickly with her real father, knowing that Tariq will never hurt or leave her. Zalmai asks for Rasheed at first, but he soon learns to love Tariq too. Laila and Tariq watch from afar as the Taliban are driven out by allied forces, following the attack on the United States on September 11th, 2001. Laila convinces Tariq to return to Kabul. On their way home, Laila visits Mariam’s hometown to say goodbye to the woman who saved her life. While there, she meets the son of Mullah Faizullah. Laila learns that the tutor is dead, and so is Mariam’s father Jalil. Jalil had written Mariam a letter, asking for her forgiveness, and he had intended to give Mariam the money from his sold land. 
Laila and Tariq use the money to renovate the orphanage, where Laila is now a teacher. Laila is pregnant with a third child. Kabul has been restored, and Laila wishes her parents were alive to see it."
Treasure,"Jim Hawkins is a young boy who lives at his parents’ inn, the Admiral Benbow, near Bristol, England, in the eighteenth century. An old sea captain named Billy Bones dies in the inn after being presented with a black spot, or official pirate verdict of guilt or judgment. Jim is stirred to action by the spot and its mysterious, accurate portent of Billy’s death. Hastily, Jim and his mother unlock Billy’s sea chest, finding a logbook and map inside. Hearing steps outside, they leave with the documents before Billy’s pursuers ransack the inn.
Jim realizes that the contents he has snatched from the sea chest must be valuable, so he takes one of the documents he has found to some local acquaintances, Dr. Livesey and Squire Trelawney. Excited, they recognize it as a map for a huge treasure that the infamous pirate Captain Flint has buried on a distant island. Trelawney immediately starts planning an expedition. Naïve in his negotiations to outfit his ship, the Hispaniola, Trelawney is tricked into hiring one of Flint’s former mates, Long John Silver, and many of Flint’s crew. Only the captain, Smollett, is trustworthy. The ship sets sail for Treasure Island with nothing amiss, until Jim overhears Silver’s plans for mutiny. Jim tells the captain about Silver and the rest of the rebellious crew.
Landing at the island, Captain Smollett devises a plan to get most of the mutineers off the ship, allowing them leisure time on shore. On a whim, Jim sneaks into the pirates’ boat and goes ashore with them. Frightened of the pirates, Jim runs off alone. From a hiding place, he witnesses Silver’s murder of a sailor who refuses to join the mutiny. Jim flees deeper into the heart of the island, where he encounters a half-crazed man named Ben Gunn. Ben had once served in Flint’s crew but was marooned on the island years earlier.
Meanwhile, Smollett and his men have gone ashore and taken shelter in a stockade the pirates have built. Jim returns to the stockade, bringing Ben with him. Silver visits and attempts a negotiation with the captain, but the captain is wary and refuses to speak to him. The pirates attack the stockade the next day, and the captain is wounded. Eager to take action, Jim follows another whim and deserts his mates, sneaking off to hunt for Ben’s handmade boat hidden in the woods.
After finding Ben’s boat, Jim sails out to the anchored ship with the intention of cutting it adrift, thereby depriving the pirates of a means of escape. He cuts the rope, but he realizes his small boat has drifted near the pirates’ camp and fears he will be discovered. By chance, the pirates do not spot Jim, and he floats around the island until he catches sight of the ship drifting wildly. Struggling aboard, he discovers that one of the watchmen, Israel Hands, has killed the other watchman in a drunken fit. Jim takes control of the ship, but Israel turns against him. Jim is wounded but kills Israel.
Jim returns to the stockade but finds it occupied by the pirates. Silver takes Jim hostage, telling the boy that the captain has given the pirates the treasure map, provisions, and the use of the stockade in exchange for their lives. Jim realizes, however, that Silver is having trouble managing his men, who accuse him of treachery. Silver proposes to Jim that they help each other survive by pretending Jim is a hostage. However, the men present Silver with a black spot and inform him that he has been deposed as their commander.
In a desperate attempt to gain control of his crew, Silver shows them the treasure map to appease them. Silver leads Jim and the men to the treasure site, but they are shocked to find it already excavated and the treasure removed. The men are angered and near mutiny again. At that moment Dr. Livesey, Ben Gunn, and the others fire on the pirate band, which scatters throughout the island. Jim and Silver flee, and are guided by the others to Ben’s cave, where Ben has hidden the treasure, which he had discovered months before.
After spending three days carrying the loot to the ship, the men prepare to set sail for home. There is a debate about the fate of the remaining mutineers. Despite the pirates’ submissive pleas, they are left marooned on the island. Silver is allowed to join the voyage, but he sneaks off the ship one night with a portion of the treasure and is never heard from again. The voyage home comes to a close. Eventually, Captain Smollet retires from the sea, and Ben becomes a lodge-keeper. Jim swears off treasure-hunting forever and suffers from nightmares about the sea and gold coins."
Fitted,"Verity opens in contemporary New York City, as protagonist Lowen Ashleigh witnesses a bloody accident where a passerby is hit by a truck. Lowen, a struggling writer, is grieving her mother's recent death and wondering where her foundering career is headed. She writes thrillers, but she’s suffering from intense writer’s block, which her state of uncertainty only seems to worsen. She’s so numbed to reality that she barely registers the accident, even as she’s soaked with the victim’s blood. 
To her surprise, a stranger helps clean her up, and they share a moment of intense romantic chemistry. She soon discovers his name is Jeremy Crawford, and that he’s married to bestselling author Verity Crawford. This author—whom Lowen respects enormously for her meticulous research and well–crafted plots—has been left incapacitated by a car accident. Verity is an internationally renowned writer, who is best known for her tactic of writing novels from the perspective of the villain. In a meeting at Pantem Publishing, Jeremy offers Lowen a significant sum to finish Verity’s final series of novels. Lowen’s agent Corey encourages her to take the deal, but Lowen is extremely nervous about the prospect. However, she can’t refuse the enormous sum the Crawfords propose to pay her. She accepts the offer with some trepidation. The narrative then moves to Vermont, the location of the Crawford family home. At Jeremy’s invitation, Lowen moves in temporarily to sort through Verity’s office and get a feel for her writing.  
However, while trying to research Verity’s work, she discovers an unpublished autobiography of Verity’s that unveils startling secrets about her life. This unpublished manuscript, entitled So Be It, disrupts the kind and loving façade that Verity has been painstakingly keeping up for over a decade. After this point, Lowen’s perspective in the novel is occasionally replaced by Verity’s as chapters of this autobiography appear in full. Rather than the loving mother and wife everyone else apparently knew, it paints Verity as a selfish and manipulative person with little regard for anyone else’s feelings. Because Verity lies comatose upstairs as Lowen reads this, Lowen begins to feel extremely uneasy about her discovery. She decides to keep the autobiography hidden from Jeremy, especially when she discovers that it reveals information that connects Verity to the tragic deaths of the Crawfords' twin daughters, Harper and Chastin. 
Lowen soon settles into life in Vermont and begins to build a relationship with Jeremy and Crew, his only living child. It’s a double life, as she grows emotionally attached to Jeremy while attempting to avoid the judgment of the Crawfords’ neighbors and nurses. She’s also concurrently and secretly following the chilling revelations that unfold constantly as she gets further into So Be It. The more Lowen becomes consumed with Verity’s dual existence, the more intensely she feels a romantic connection to Jeremy. At this point in the novel, Jeremy has only acted respectfully, unselfishly, and chivalrously in every interaction Lowen has seen. Although she knows he’s married, she can’t shake her attraction to him. The two draw closer and closer as their attraction to each other becomes too strong to ignore. Financial circumstances and an apartment offer falling through mean Lowen has to stay in Vermont much longer than planned. This gives her time for two things outside of her work: to get to know Jeremy and to develop a building horror of Verity’s presence and the unnerving coincidences that seem to follow her. Lowen quickly begins to feel that she’s being carefully watched. 
Lowen begins to write Verity’s remaining books in earnest, sending outlines to her agent and trying to make sense of her mass of papers and notes. However, the temptation to covertly read more of Verity’s autobiography is strong whenever Lowen is alone in the office. Every time she succumbs to it, she discovers more unnerving things about Verity’s sociopathic, transactional view of relationships. She discovers that Verity is an obsessive, jealous lover who tried to abort her own twins when she realizes she would have to share Jeremy’s love with them. It also quickly becomes evident that Verity was directly involved in the murder of her daughter, Harper. She believed Harper had deliberately killed Chastin, even though there was no proof, o Verity killed Harper. Lowen is caught in a moral dilemma because this evidence had previously remained totally concealed. She struggles with whether it would be fitting or even ethically correct to expose Verity’s secrets to Jeremy, or if it would be kinder to protect him from the painful truth about his homicidal, mentally unstable wife. 
While all this is happening, the atmosphere in the Crawford home is becoming increasingly tense and mysterious. Lowen feels she is constantly being observed and begins noticing inconsistencies whenever Verity is left alone. Doors are inexplicably locked and unlocked, household objects disappear, and devices mysteriously turn off or are set to mute. Lowen is sensitive to small coincidences and to the privacy that locked doors promise because she has a history of dangerous sleepwalking. She suspects that Verity can move around and isn’t actually comatose at all. This is later reinforced by Crew, who accidentally mentions things his mother has recently said to him. Despite all this, Lowen's feelings for Jeremy deepen, and they begin a romantic, sexual relationship. This all contributes to the novel’s climax, where Lowen reveals the autobiography to Jeremy. Jeremy doesn’t want to believe Lowen when she tells him Verity is not immobilized, but he eventually relents and agrees to read So Be It. After Lowen gives him the autobiography, she waits in agony for him to finish it. She hears him cry out in pain and storm upstairs to confront his wife. 
Verity pretends to have no reaction when Jeremy speaks to her and only responds when he threatens to hand her manuscript over to the police. She drops the mask of being unconscious and reveals she’s been aware of everything that’s happening in the Crawford house. She’s been pretending to be comatose while manipulating the situation to test Jeremy's loyalty to her, and to try and escape with their son Crew and the funds from Lowen’s new books. Jeremy, furious, tries to strangle her for killing Harper. Lowen stops him, telling him that if he kills her that way, Crew will lose his father. She suggests instead that if Jeremy forces her to vomit, they can make the murder look like inhalation pneumonia and avoid a criminal investigation. Jeremy does so, and Verity dies gruesomely, choking on her own vomit. 
At the end of the novel, Jeremy, Crew, and a pregnant Lowen are in the process of moving out of the Vermont house to start a new life in North Carolina. However, Lowen finds a letter addressed to Jeremy hidden under the floorboards in her room. In this letter, Verity makes shocking revelations. She reveals that she’d written the autobiography first as writing practice and then as a therapeutic exercise, casting herself as the “antagonistic narrator” as she did in her novels. The letter says that she had planned to escape with Crew and explains that Harper’s death was actually an accident. She says she still loves Jeremy and regrets what happened but must prioritize Crew’s safety. Lowen panics and destroys the manuscript, deciding never to burden Jeremy with the knowledge of it.  
However, she’s still unsure whether the letter or the autobiography reflects the absolute truth. The novel ends with Lowen questioning the extent to which any of the people involved in the Crawfords’ family tragedies understood the whole of the matter and acknowledging the ingenious manipulations Verity was able to orchestrate."
Standing,"Rashad and Quinn are both students at Springfield Central High School. They have some friends in common but have never interacted with each other. Rashad is Black, and his father has told him throughout his life about the importance of discipline for young Black men. Rashad’s father joined the army and then the police force before retiring and often tells Rashad that the army is the best opportunity for a Black man to succeed in the United States. Because of this, Rashad is part of the Reserve Officer Training Corps, or ROTC. However, Rashad would rather spend his time drawing and hanging out with his friends English, Shannon, and Carlos. 
Quinn is white, and his father died in Afghanistan. Quinn lives with his mother and his younger brother, Willy, and resents that people expect him to live up to the memory of his father. Quinn’s best friends are Dwyer and Guzzo, who lives across the street. Guzzo’s brother, Paul Galluzzo, is a police officer and has acted as a father figure to Quinn ever since Quinn’s father died. Quinn, Dwyer, and Guzzo are on the basketball team together, along with English.
One Friday, Rashad and Quinn are each planning on going to a party with their friends at Guzzo and Paul’s cousin Jill’s house. Quinn has a crush on Jill. On the way to the party, Rashad stops at Jerry’s Corner Mart to pick up some chips and gum. Jerry’s is always monitored by a police officer as a response to shoplifting incidents at the store. While Rashad is picking out chips, he goes to text his brother, Spoony. His phone is in his bag, so he puts it on the floor and kneels down to take the phone out. While he is kneeling, a woman who was standing behind him backs up and trips over him, causing them both to fall over and Rashad’s chips to slide up the aisle. 
The police officer on duty comes over and asks what happened but assumes Rashad was trying to steal before Rashad or the woman can explain. The police officer drags Rashad outside, handcuffs him, throws him to the ground, and begins beating him. Meanwhile, Quinn and his friends have been waiting in the alley next to Jerry’s to ask an adult to buy them beer that they can take to the party. When Quinn goes around to the front of Jerry’s, he sees what the police officer is doing to Rashad. He recognizes the police officer as Paul Galluzzo. He tells his friends to run and, when they are far enough away, explains what happened and tells Guzzo that he saw his brother. The three decide to go to the party and try to forget about it.
Over the weekend, Rashad wakes up in the hospital with a broken nose and ribs and is told he needs to stay there so the doctors can monitor his internal bleeding. Rashad’s father questions whether Rashad was presenting himself in a way that made him seem dangerous, while Spoony is outraged at the situation. The local news obtains footage of Paul beating Rashad and begins covering the story. The Galluzzo family decides to have a cookout on Sunday, which Quinn and Jill both find strange. Quinn and Jill talk at the cookout about what Paul did to Rashad, while Paul and Guzzo try to intimidate Quinn into not saying anything about what he saw.
At school that week, everyone is talking about what happened to Rashad. Quinn feels conflicted as he has only ever seen the good side of Paul and doesn’t know Rashad. On Tuesday, someone has painted graffiti on the sidewalk in front of the school that says, “Rashad is absent again today.” This message creates a division in the school between those who believe Rashad was innocent and those who believe Paul was just doing his job. When Rashad sees a picture of the graffiti, he knows it is Carlos’s work. 
Spoony and his girlfriend, Berry, plan a protest that coming Friday against the police department. Guzzo continues to question Quinn’s loyalty. At first, Quinn wants to believe that Paul was just trying to do his job, but he just can’t forget what he saw outside Jerry’s. On Thursday, Quinn wears a shirt to school that says, “I’m marching. Are you?” The coach of the basketball team tells the players not to go to the protest and tells Quinn he will call his mother to tell her about his shirt. Quinn’s mother confronts him about the protest, and Quinn says he is standing up for what he believes in, just as his father would have done.
The doctor releases Rashad from the hospital on Thursday, and Rashad plans on joining the protest the following day. On Friday morning, Rashad and Quinn both feel nervous about the protest. Quinn sees a tank-like police vehicle headed toward the school and worries about the protesters’ safety. However, after talking with Jill, he understands that Black people live in fear of police violence every day and that they should put themselves at risk for one day to speak out against this reality. Rashad and Quinn, along with an enormous crowd, march from Jerry’s Corner Mart to the police department, where they stage a die-in as Berry reads aloud the names of unarmed Black people killed by police officers. Rashad and Quinn notice each other during the die-in and feel a connection as they both think of the people on the list and how they will keep fighting for them."
Moment,"The protagonist, who is named Tim O’Brien, begins by describing an event that occurred in the middle of his Vietnam experience. “The Things They Carried” catalogs the variety of things his fellow soldiers in the Alpha Company brought on their missions. Several of these things are intangible, including guilt and fear, while others are specific physical objects, including matches, morphine, M-16 rifles, and M&M’s candy.
Throughout the collection, the same characters reappear in various stories. The first member of the Alpha Company to die is Ted Lavender, a “grunt,” or low-ranking soldier, who deals with his anxiety about the war by taking tranquilizers and smoking marijuana. Lavender is shot in the head on his way back from going to the bathroom, and his superior, Lieutenant Jimmy Cross, blames himself for the tragedy. When Lavender is shot, Cross is distracting himself with thoughts of Martha, a college crush. It is revealed in “Love” that Cross’s feelings for Martha, whom he dated once before leaving for Vietnam, were never reciprocated, and that even twenty years after the war, his guilt over Lavender’s death remains.
In “On the Rainy River,” the narrator, O’Brien, explains the series of events that led him to Vietnam in the first place. He receives his draft notice in June of 1968, and his feelings of confusion drive him north to the Canadian border, which he contemplates crossing so that he will not be forced to fight in a war in which he doesn’t believe. Sitting in a rowboat with the proprietor of the Tip Top Lodge, where he stays, O’Brien decides that his guilt about avoiding the war and fear of disappointing his family are more important than his political convictions. He soon leaves, going first back home to Worthington, Minnesota and later to Vietnam.
In addition to Ted Lavender, a few other members of the Alpha Company are killed during their mission overseas, including Curt Lemon, who is killed when he steps on a rigged mortar round. Though O’Brien is not close to Lemon, in “The Dentist,” he tells a story of how Lemon, who faints before a routine checkup with an army-issued dentist, tries to save face by insisting that a perfectly good tooth be pulled. Lee Strunk, another member of the company, dies from injuries he sustains by stepping on a landmine. In “Friends,” O’Brien remembers that before Strunk was fatally hurt, Strunk and Dave Jensen had made a pact that if either man were irreparably harmed, the other man would see that he was quickly killed. However, when Strunk is actually hurt, he begs Jensen to spare him, and Jensen complies. Instead of being upset by the news of his friend’s swift death en route to treatment, Jensen is relieved.
The death that receives the most attention in The Things They Carried is that of Kiowa, a much-loved member of the Alpha Company and one of O’Brien’s closest friends. In “Speaking of Courage,” the story of Kiowa’s death is relayed in retrospect through the memory of Norman Bowker, years after the war. As Bowker drives around a lake in his Iowa hometown, he thinks that he failed to save Kiowa, who was killed when a mortar round hit and caused him to sink headfirst into a marshy field. O’Brien realizes that he has dealt with his guilt over Kiowa’s death differently than Norman Bowker in “Notes.” Just before the end of the war, O’Brien receives a long letter from Bowker that says he hasn’t found a way to make life meaningful after the war. O’Brien resolves to tell Bowker’s story, and the story of Kiowa’s death, in order to negotiate his own feelings of guilt and hollowness.
Like “Love” and “Notes,” several of O’Brien’s stories are told from a perspective twenty years after the Vietnam War, when he is a forty-three-year-old writer living in Massachusetts. Exposure to the guilt of old friends like Jimmy Cross and Norman Bowker prompts him to write stories in order to understand what they were going through. But two stories, “The Man I Killed” and “Ambush,” are written so that O’Brien can confront his own guilt over killing a man with a grenade outside the village of My Khe. In “The Man I Killed,” O’Brien imagines the life of his victim, from his childhood to the way things would have turned out for him had O’Brien not spotted him on a path and thrown a grenade at his feet. In “Ambush,” O’Brien imagines how he might relay the story of the man he killed to his nine-year-old daughter, Kathleen. In this second story, O’Brien provides more details of the actual killing—including the sound of the grenade and his own feelings—and explains that even well after the fact, he hasn’t finished sorting out the experience.
In the last story, “The Lives of the Dead,” O’Brien gives another twist to his contention that stories have the power to save people. In the stories of Curt Lemon and Kiowa, O’Brien explains that his imagination allowed him to grapple successfully with his guilt and confusion over the death of his fourth-grade first love, Linda."
Princes,"The narrator, an airplane pilot, crashes in the Sahara desert. The crash badly damages his airplane and leaves the narrator with very little food or water. As he is worrying over his predicament, he is approached by the little prince, a very serious little blond boy who asks the narrator to draw him a sheep. The narrator obliges, and the two become friends. The pilot learns that the little prince comes from a small planet that the little prince calls Asteroid 325 but that people on Earth call Asteroid B-612. The little prince took great care of this planet, preventing any bad seeds from growing and making sure it was never overrun by baobab trees. One day, a mysterious rose sprouted on the planet and the little prince fell in love with it. But when he caught the rose in a lie one day, he decided that he could not trust her anymore. He grew lonely and decided to leave. Despite a last-minute reconciliation with the rose, the prince set out to explore other planets and cure his loneliness.
While journeying, the narrator tells us, the little prince passes by neighboring asteroids and encounters for the first time the strange, narrow-minded world of grown-ups. On the first six planets the little prince visits, he meets a king, a vain man, a drunkard, a businessman, a lamplighter, and a geographer, all of whom live alone and are overly consumed by their chosen occupations. Such strange behavior both amuses and perturbs the little prince. He does not understand their need to order people around, to be admired, and to own everything. With the exception of the lamplighter, whose dogged faithfulness he admires, the little prince does not think much of the adults he visits, and he does not learn anything useful. However, he learns from the geographer that flowers do not last forever, and he begins to miss the rose he has left behind.
At the geographer’s suggestion, the little prince visits Earth, but he lands in the middle of the desert and cannot find any humans. Instead, he meets a snake who speaks in riddles and hints darkly that its lethal poison can send the little prince back to the heavens if he so wishes. The little prince ignores the offer and continues his explorations, stopping to talk to a three-petaled flower and to climb the tallest mountain he can find, where he confuses the echo of his voice for conversation. Eventually, the little prince finds a rose garden, which surprises and depresses him—his rose had told him that she was the only one of her kind.
The prince befriends a fox, who teaches him that the important things in life are visible only to the heart, that his time away from the rose makes the rose more special to him, and that love makes a person responsible for the beings that one loves. The little prince realizes that, even though there are many roses, his love for his rose makes her unique and that he is therefore responsible for her. Despite this revelation, he still feels very lonely because he is so far away from his rose. The prince ends his story by describing his encounters with two men, a railway switchman and a salesclerk.
It is now the narrator’s eighth day in the desert, and at the prince’s suggestion, they set off to find a well. The water feeds their hearts as much as their bodies, and the two share a moment of bliss as they agree that too many people do not see what is truly important in life. The little prince’s mind, however, is fixed on returning to his rose, and he begins making plans with the snake to head back to his planet. The narrator is able to fix his plane on the day before the one-year anniversary of the prince’s arrival on Earth, and he walks sadly with his friend out to the place the prince landed. The snake bites the prince, who falls noiselessly to the sand.
The narrator takes comfort when he cannot find the prince’s body the next day and is confident that the prince has returned to his asteroid. The narrator is also comforted by the stars, in which he now hears the tinkling of his friend’s laughter. Often, however, he grows sad and wonders if the sheep he drew has eaten the prince’s rose. The narrator concludes by showing his readers a drawing of the desert landscape and by asking us to stop for a while under the stars if we are ever in the area and to let the narrator know immediately if the little prince has returned."
Village,"On the night that a fire rages between the woods of Fanteland and Asanteland, Effia is born. Throughout her childhood, her mother, Baaba, is extremely cruel. As Effia grows, Baaba tells her to keep the fact that she has begun menstruating a secret so that she cannot marry their village’s new chief. Instead, Effia is sent to marry the British governor of Cape Coast Castle, James Collins. While pregnant, Effia returns to her village as her father is dying. There, she learns from her brother Fiifi that Baaba was not her real mother. Her mother was an enslaved girl named Maame who ran away into the fire the night Effia was born. Though Effia doesn’t know this, Maame married a Big Man in an Asante village and gave birth to another girl, Esi. Esi has a privileged childhood but is captured at fifteen and taken to the dungeon of the Cape Coast Castle. There, she is raped and then put on a slave ship to America.
Effia’s son Quey has a lonely childhood at the castle, though he makes friends with a boy named Cudjo. However, after Quey’s father witnesses a tender moment between the two boys, he sends Quey to live in London. Quey later goes to his mother’s village to help his uncle, Fiifi, with his work in the slave trade. Though this is not the life Quey wants, he marries the daughter of an Asante king, Nana Yaa, whom Fiifi kidnapped. Meanwhile, Esi’s daughter Ness is enslaved on a plantation in Alabama. At a previous plantation, she was forced to marry another slave, Sam, and they had a child named Kojo. One day, Ness, Sam, and Kojo attempt to escape with the help of a woman named Aku, but Ness and Sam are caught. Back at the plantation, Ness is whipped and Sam is lynched.
When Quey and Nana Yaa’s son, James, travels with them to Nana Yaa’s father’s funeral, he becomes enamored with a girl named Akosua, who chastises his family’s involvement in the slave trade. Though James is promised to marry another woman, he’s determined to marry Akosua. Eventually, James fakes his own death and finds Akosua. On Esi’s side, Aku and Kojo escape to Maryland, where Kojo, or “Jo,” works as a deckhand. Jo and his wife Anna worry about their family’s safety after the passage of the Fugitive Slave Act. One day, Anna doesn’t return home from work. After a few weeks, Jo learns that Anna was taken by a white man. Once his children are grown, a broken Jo moves to New York.
Quey and Akosua’s daughter, Abena, is unmarried at the age of twenty-five, though she is waiting for her childhood friend Ohene Nyarko to take her as his second wife. Abena and Ohene begin sleeping together, but he cannot promise to marry her until he has a good harvest. For years, the harvest is bad, and the village blames Abena. Eventually, Ohene is able to grow cocoa but promised to marry the daughter of the man who sold the plants to him. Now pregnant, Abena leaves the village for a missionary church.
In America, Jo and Anna’s son H is born on a plantation just after Anna has killed herself. H works as a sharecropper after the Civil War. After being arrested for looking at a white woman, H works in the mines as a convict. When his sentence is up, H moves to Pratt City, where he continues to work in mines but joins a union to fight for better pay and working conditions. Though his wife, Ethe, left him years earlier, he writes to her, and she returns to him.
Abena’s daughter, Akua, grows up in the missionary where her mother Abena lived after leaving the village. Akua leaves the church after the missionary tells her he drowned Abena while attempting to baptize her. Akua marries and has two daughters and a son, though she is plagued by dreams of a woman made of fire. One night, in her sleep, Akua burns her family’s hut. Only Akua, her husband, and her son, Yaw, survive. Meanwhile, H and Ethe’s daughter, Willie, moves to Harlem with her husband, Robert, and their son, Carson. Robert is light-skinned and passes as white in Harlem, which allows him to easily find work. One night, while cleaning a jazz club, Willie runs into Robert in the bathroom, and Robert’s white colleagues force him to assault her. Robert then leaves Willie. A few years later, Willie sees Robert with a white wife and son.
Yaw grows up to be a history teacher, though he has trouble finding a wife due to the scars on his face from the fire his mother set. He eventually falls in love with his house girl, Esther. She encourages Yaw to make peace with Akua, whom he hasn’t seen since he was a baby. Yaw and Esther visit Akua, who explains that she set the fire because she was haunted by the evil in their lineage. Yaw forgives his mother.
Willie’s son Carson, who now goes by the name Sonny, works for the NAACP and is involved in the Civil Rights Movement, though he feels frustrated with the lack of progress. Sonny becomes addicted to heroin after a woman, Amani, introduces him to the drug. One day, Willie explains to Sonny what happened to his father. With this knowledge, Sonny decides to finally get clean.
Yaw and Esther move to Alabama with their daughter, Marjorie. Marjorie feels a deep connection to her grandmother and to Ghana and does not fit in with either the Black or white kids in Alabama. Marjorie develops feelings for her friend Graham, a white boy, though he feels they cannot be together due to their different races. Marjorie later meets Marcus, Sonny and Amani’s son, while they are both graduate students at Stanford. Marcus and Marjorie travel together to Ghana, where Marcus is overwhelmed with emotions on visiting the Cape Coast Castle. They swim together in the water, and Marjorie welcomes Marcus home."
Auspicious,"Two men, Vladimir and Estragon, meet near a tree. They converse on various topics and reveal that they are waiting there for a man named Godot. While they wait, two other men enter. Pozzo is on his way to the market to sell his slave, Lucky. He pauses for a while to converse with Vladimir and Estragon. Lucky entertains them by dancing and thinking, and Pozzo and Lucky leave.
After Pozzo and Lucky leave, a boy enters and tells Vladimir that he is a messenger from Godot. He tells Vladimir that Godot will not be coming tonight, but that he will surely come tomorrow. Vladimir asks him some questions about Godot and the boy departs. After his departure, Vladimir and Estragon decide to leave, but they do not move as the curtain falls.
The next night, Vladimir and Estragon again meet near the tree to wait for Godot. Lucky and Pozzo enter again, but this time Pozzo is blind and Lucky is dumb. Pozzo does not remember meeting the two men the night before. They leave and Vladimir and Estragon continue to wait.
Shortly after, the boy enters and once again tells Vladimir that Godot will not be coming. He insists that he did not speak to Vladimir yesterday. After he leaves, Estragon and Vladimir decide to leave, but again they do not move as the curtain falls, ending the play."
Politics,"In Common Sense, Thomas Paine argues for American independence. His argument begins with more general, theoretical reflections about government and religion, then progresses onto the specifics of the colonial situation.
Paine begins by distinguishing between government and society. Society, according to Paine, is everything constructive and good that people join together to accomplish. Government, on the other hand, is an institution whose sole purpose is to protect us from our own vices. Government has its origins in the evil of man and is therefore a necessary evil at best. Paine says that government's sole purpose is to protect life, liberty and property, and that a government should be judged solely on the basis of the extent to which it accomplishes this goal.
Paine then considers an imagined scenario in which a small group of people has been placed on an island, and cut off from the rest of society. In time, these people develop ties with one another, and lawmaking becomes inevitable. Paine says the people will be much happier if they are responsible for the creation of the laws that rule them. Paine is also implicitly arguing that such a system of representation is also better for the American colonists. Having expressed his disagreement with British reign in America, Paine proceeds to launch a general attack on the British system of government. Paine says the British system is too complex and rife with contradictions, and that the monarchy is granted far too much power. The British system pretends to offer a reasonable system of checks and balances, but in fact, it does not.
From here Paine moves on to discuss, in general, the notions of monarchy and hereditary succession. Man, Pain argues, was born into a state of equality, and the distinction that has arisen between king and subject is an unnatural one. At first, Paine says, the world was without kings, but the ancient Jews decided they wanted a king. This angered God, but he allowed them to have one. Paine presents pages of biblical evidence detailing God's wrath at the idea of the Jews having a king. The conclusion Paine reaches is that the practice of monarchy originates from sin, and is an institution that the Bible and God condemn. Paine calls hereditary succession an abominable practice. He says that even if people were to choose to have a king, that does not legitimize that King's child acting as a future ruler. Furthermore, hereditary succession has brought with it innumerable evils, such as incompetent kings, corruption, and civil war.
Having dispensed with the preliminary theoretical issues, Paine sets in to discuss the details of the American situation. In response to the argument that America has flourished under British rule, and therefore ought to stay under the king, Paine says that such an argument fails to realize that America has evolved and no longer needs Britain's help. Some say that Britain has protected America, and therefore deserves allegiance, but Paine responds that Britain has only watched over America in order to secure its own economic well-being. Paine adds that most recently, instead of watching over the colonies, the British have been attacking them, and are therefore undeserving of American loyalty.
Paine says that the colonies have little to gain from remaining attached to Britain. Commerce can be better conducted with the rest of Europe, but only after America becomes independent. Paine also asserts that if the colonies remain attached to Britain, the same problems that have arisen in the past will arise in the future. Paine argues that it is necessary to seek independence now, as to do otherwise would only briefly cover up problems that will surely reemerge.
Paine even proposes the form of government that the independent colonies should adopt. His recommendation is for a representative democracy that gives roughly equal weight to each of the colonies.
Paine explains why the current time is a good time to break free of Britain. Primarily, Paine focuses on the present size of the colonies, and on their current capabilities. He presents an inventory of the British Navy and gives calculations revealing how America could build a navy of comparable size. Paine recommends this as a way of ensuring America's security and prosperity in trade. Paine also argues that America is sufficiently small as to be united now. If time were to elapse, and the population of the colonies to grow, the same feeling of unity would not be present. Paine adds that if the Americans revolt now, they can use the vast expanses of uncharted land to the West in order to pay down some of the debt they will incur.
Paine says that as a colony of Britain, America lacks respectability on the international scene. They are seen simply as rebels, and cannot form substantial alliances with other nations. In order to prosper in the long term, the colonies need to be independent. Paine says that, by declaring independence, America will be able to ask for the help of other countries in its struggle for freedom. For all of these reasons, Paine says it is imperative and urgent that the colonies declare independence."
Embark,"Into the Wild contains two interconnected plots, one that involves directly represented action and another that involves the careful development of a psychological portrait of Christopher McCandless. The first plot tracks McCandless’s journey into the wild, while the second tracks the development of Krakauer’s, and, implicitly, the reader’s, understanding of McCandless’s character and motivations. Neither plot is presented in linear fashion, and the two often intersect through the presentation of subtle detail, description, and the elaboration of multiple possible lines of cause and effect. Krakauer serves as the narrator throughout the book.
Into the Wild begins with the discovery of Christopher McCandless’s body by a group of Alaskan hunters who visit Denali National Park and Preserve on a yearly excursion. They radio for help. The FBI arrives and removes the body. Krakauer then visits with Wayne Westerberg, who knew Christopher McCandless as “Alex McCandless” and who provides an initial character sketch of the young man, Krakauer in a bar in Carthage, Wisconsin. Westerberg employed McCandless on and off on his grain elevator and remembers him as engaging, intelligent, and determined. Details from McCandless’s comfortable, middle-class Virginia upbringing and his dislike of materialism further Krakauer’s understanding of the young man. These same details take the narrator back to the first leg of McCandless’s journey west in his used yellow Datsun.
Just after graduating from college, McCandless drives to Lake Mead in Nevada, where a flashflood wets the engine of the Datsun. He leaves it and a number of other possessions behind. After two months of tramping, he buys a canoe on impulse and paddles down the Colorado River to Mexico. The journey takes five months. In the meantime, the McCandless family begins investigating their son’s disappearance. After his canoeing excursion, McCandless lives and works in Bullhead City, Arizona. An old man named Charlie takes him in briefly, before McCandless departs and meets Jan Buress and her old boyfriend in California. He engages in the social life of Buress’s drifters’ camp but leaves hastily, intending to embark on his trip to Alaska. Krakauer receives a letter from and then meets Ronald Franz, who describes to Krakauer the father-son relationship he established with McCandless. The narrator uses Franz’s story to initiate a line of investigation into the harm McCandless’s risk-taking behavior caused others.
Krakauer next visits Wayne Westerberg again and reconstructs McCandless’s last month in Carthage, South Dakota by speaking with Westerberg’s girlfriend and his mother. He acquires insight into McCandless’s troubled relationship with his father and relates that in late April, 1992, McCandless sent his friends postcards revealing that he was leaving for the wild, perhaps never to return. Krakauer’s investigation then move through his revelation that many readers of his original Outdoor magazine article about McCandless thought that Christopher McCandless was an incompetent, romantic fool. In response, Krakauer embarks on the telling of the stories of three other twentieth century wilderness fanatics who disappeared or died in the wild. He evaluates each and decides that McCandless has the most in common the young artist Everett Ruess.
Back at the bus in Alaska, state troopers attempt to identify McCandless’s body. Jim Gallien reads about the finding of the corpse and then contacts the police, setting off a string of events that lead to the identification of the body. Krakauer next visits with McCandless’s family, beginning with his father, Walt McCandless, and his mother, Billie McCandless. Billie shows Krakauer photographs of Christopher’s childhood and Walt describes the heartbreak his son has caused the family. Krakauer’s investigation then picks up a new subject: McCandless’s frustration with his family. When McCandless graduated from high school, he went on a trip to California and discovered that his father had been a bigamist. Krakauer theorizes that McCandless’s anger at this long-kept family secret offers some motivation for his desire to leave his life behind.
Krakauer then dedicates two chapters to his own ascent of the Devils Thumb. These parallel the plot of McCandless’s journey. Krakauer attempts the glacier’s north face and is rebuffed, then spends three days trapped at his base camp. After accidentally setting his tent on fire, he makes a desperate attempt at the southeast face and succeeds. Recalling this story allows Krakauer conclude that Christopher McCandless must not have been suicidal when he began his trip.
Jon Krakauer’s own trip to Denali National Park and the abandoned bus where McCandless died closes out the narrative. Along with three experienced Alaskans, Krakauer crosses the same river whose flooding prevented McCandless from leaving the wild. The four hikers encounter the bus in the late evening and examine its contents. Everything seems to have been as McCandless left it. The party eats dinner and reflects on the circumstances that could have led McCandless to head into the wild. In an epilogue, the author visits the bus again with Walt and Billie McCandless, Christopher McCandless’s mother and father."
Parents,"Marjane “Marji” Satrapi is an intelligent, spirited, and very modern girl living with her parents in Iran’s capital of Tehran during the eventful period of Iranian history from the late 1970s into the early 1980s. In Persepolis: The Story of a Childhood, Marji’s remembers her life during those years, mostly from when she was about ten to age fourteen. This account includes how Marji and her family lived through and were affected by turbulent events that included the overthrow of the autocratic Shah of Iran by the Islamic revolution, the oppressive fundamentalist regime that replaced the Shah, and the devasting Iran-Iraq war.
The nation’s wealth has long made it a target of outside invaders, but Islamic revolution of 1979 has pushed out the Western-backed government of the Shah.  The revolution has ushered in a new Islamic regime that is bringing massive societal changes impacting how people are supposed to behave--including Marji and her family. Marji struggles to adjust to the changes at her liberal French bilingual school, which has become increasingly stricter. Girls are required to wear veils and female and male students are now separated. Marji’s wealthy and modern parents—her father, Ebi, and her mother, Taji—take part in the massive protests against the new regime’s strict rules on behavior (just as they had previously protested against the Shah’s regime). Marji’s parents worry when a photo of Marji’s mother a protest appears in newspapers magazines. Later, after a demonstration they are at turns violent, the Satrapis decide that openly protesting is too dangerous to continue to do.
Marji feels conflict between her own deeply spiritual feelings and the stark modernism of her parents. She talks to God at night and has believed she will become a prophet one day since she was six years old, Marji. But the revolution leads to Marji setting aside these ambitions while she studies and imitates protestors and revolutionaries. She mimics protestors in the garden of her house and studies books about famous revolutionaries and philosophers given to her by her parents. She fantasizes about becoming a hero and wants her parents to become heroes too. Marji’s relationship with God becomes strained, as she finds that she and God have less to talk about—although God does still come by to see her from time to time.
Marji thrills when she learns that rebels fill her family history. She learns that her grandfather was a prince and later a communist whom the Shah removed from power and that her uncle Anoosh, also a communist, spent nine years in prison during the Shah’s regime. Marji spends a short time with Anoosh, learning about his life. After the Shah fell from power in 1979, Anoosh was released from prison, but when Islamic fundamentalists consolidate their grip on power, they hunt Anoosh down, imprison him, and later execute him. Her new idol killed, Marji feels crushed. She completely abandons her faith in God and increasingly questions the pro-regime propaganda she hears—especially at school.
Marji deeply loves and identifies with of her parents, even if she does sometimes feel that their actions and behavior (as wealthy and privileged individuals) do not always live up to their pro-democratic and liberal rhetoric. Marji also has a special connection with her grandmother, who remains stoic and inspiring to Marji in spite of the turmoil and numerous tragedies stemming from political actions that impact her and the family. Marji’s uncle Anoosh is not Marji’s only direct experience with the cruel consequences of the government’s actions. Throughout the book, death and devastation occurs among Marji’s extended family and friends as direct results of the brutality and fanaticism of the Iranian regimes and the war with Iraq.
People had rejoiced when the Shah was forced out, but as Islamic fundamentalists retain power, Marji and her family watch as their neighbors’ behavior shifts back and forth to coincide with the current political winds. The neighbors go from wearing short skirts and drinking alcohol to covering themselves and denouncing the use of alcohol. Marji’s parents ask her to tell everyone that she prays every day, a lie they hope will keep Marji safe, but acknowledge that the rules seem foolish. Marji grows more rebellious, as she increasingly views the rules at school and elsewhere as hypocritical and difficult to follow. Armed with more knowledge and personal experience, Marji begins to act out in ways that put her safety at risk. In fact, she even (accidentally) hits her principal during an argument, which results in her expulsion from school. Fearing her rebellious behavior will get her killed, Marji’s mother tries to reason with Marji by telling her that it is not her responsibility to serve justice and that the bad guys eventually pay for their sins in the end.
The war with Iraq had originally inspired Marji to vocal patriotism in protection her country against another invasion, but Marji begins to realize there are greater forces behind the war. She sees how the Islamic regime needs the war to continue survive and keep power. The war promotes a sense of nationalism and pride in the public, and those who die in the war are hailed as “martyrs.” Marji sees thousands of poor boys lured into war without proper training. She becomes increasingly uncomfortable and aware of class differences within society. Poor young boys are lured into the army with gold-painted keys to the “kingdom of heaven” to help them enter paradise after dying on the battlefield, while children in her wealthy neighborhood are left alone.
More and more people try to escape Iran as the borders tighten and Iraqi forces bomb Tehran and other Iranian cities. Realizing that Marji’s chances of escaping Iran are narrowing, her parents make the difficult decision to send her abroad alone to finish school in Vienna, explaining that only a good education will free her of Iran. Marji feels heartbroken. She spends one last night with her grandmother, who gives her warm advice and inspires her to be compassionate and understanding while in Vienna. Marji gives away all of her prized contraband to her friends, including a Kim Wilde poster. At the airport, as Marji turns to say goodbye to her parents one last time to see that her mother, devasted by her only child’s departure, has fainted."
Useful,"In the midst of a raging war, a plane evacuating a group of schoolboys from Britain is shot down over a deserted tropical island. Two of the boys, Ralph and Piggy, discover a conch shell on the beach, and Piggy realizes it could be used as a horn to summon the other boys. Once assembled, the boys set about electing a leader and devising a way to be rescued. They choose Ralph as their leader, and Ralph appoints another boy, Jack, to be in charge of the boys who will hunt food for the entire group.
Ralph, Jack, and another boy, Simon, set off on an expedition to explore the island. When they return, Ralph declares that they must light a signal fire to attract the attention of passing ships. The boys succeed in igniting some dead wood by focusing sunlight through the lenses of Piggy’s eyeglasses. However, the boys pay more attention to playing than to monitoring the fire, and the flames quickly engulf the forest. A large swath of dead wood burns out of control, and one of the youngest boys in the group disappears, presumably having burned to death.
At first, the boys enjoy their life without grown-ups and spend much of their time splashing in the water and playing games. Ralph, however, complains that they should be maintaining the signal fire and building huts for shelter. The hunters fail in their attempt to catch a wild pig, but their leader, Jack, becomes increasingly preoccupied with the act of hunting.
When a ship passes by on the horizon one day, Ralph and Piggy notice, to their horror, that the signal fire—which had been the hunters’ responsibility to maintain—has burned out. Furious, Ralph accosts Jack, but the hunter has just returned with his first kill, and all the hunters seem gripped with a strange frenzy, reenacting the chase in a kind of wild dance. Piggy criticizes Jack, who hits Piggy across the face. Ralph blows the conch shell and reprimands the boys in a speech intended to restore order. At the meeting, it quickly becomes clear that some of the boys have started to become afraid. The littlest boys, known as “littluns,” have been troubled by nightmares from the beginning, and more and more boys now believe that there is some sort of beast or monster lurking on the island. The older boys try to convince the others at the meeting to think rationally, asking where such a monster could possibly hide during the daytime. One of the littluns suggests that it hides in the sea—a proposition that terrifies the entire group.
Not long after the meeting, some military planes engage in a battle high above the island. The boys, asleep below, do not notice the flashing lights and explosions in the clouds. A parachutist drifts to earth on the signal-fire mountain, dead. Sam and Eric, the twins responsible for watching the fire at night, are asleep and do not see the parachutist land. When the twins wake up, they see the enormous silhouette of his parachute and hear the strange flapping noises it makes. Thinking the island beast is at hand, they rush back to the camp in terror and report that the beast has attacked them.
The boys organize a hunting expedition to search for the monster. Jack and Ralph, who are increasingly at odds, travel up the mountain. They see the silhouette of the parachute from a distance and think that it looks like a huge, deformed ape. The group holds a meeting at which Jack and Ralph tell the others of the sighting. Jack says that Ralph is a coward and that he should be removed from office, but the other boys refuse to vote Ralph out of power. Jack angrily runs away down the beach, calling all the hunters to join him. Ralph rallies the remaining boys to build a new signal fire, this time on the beach rather than on the mountain. They obey, but before they have finished the task, most of them have slipped away to join Jack.
Jack declares himself the leader of the new tribe of hunters and organizes a hunt and a violent, ritual slaughter of a sow to solemnize the occasion. The hunters then decapitate the sow and place its head on a sharpened stake in the jungle as an offering to the beast. Later, encountering the bloody, fly-covered head, Simon has a terrible vision, during which it seems to him that the head is speaking. The voice, which he imagines as belonging to the Lord of the Flies, says that Simon will never escape him, for he exists within all men. Simon faints. When he wakes up, he goes to the mountain, where he sees the dead parachutist. Understanding then that the beast does not exist externally but rather within each individual boy, Simon travels to the beach to tell the others what he has seen. But the others are in the midst of a chaotic revelry—even Ralph and Piggy have joined Jack’s feast—and when they see Simon’s shadowy figure emerge from the jungle, they fall upon him and kill him with their bare hands and teeth.
The following morning, Ralph and Piggy discuss what they have done. Jack’s hunters attack them and their few followers and steal Piggy’s glasses in the process. Ralph’s group travels to Jack’s stronghold in an attempt to make Jack see reason, but Jack orders Sam and Eric tied up and fights with Ralph. In the ensuing battle, one boy, Roger, rolls a boulder down the mountain, killing Piggy and shattering the conch shell. Ralph barely manages to escape a torrent of spears.
Ralph hides for the rest of the night and the following day, while the others hunt him like an animal. Jack has the other boys ignite the forest in order to smoke Ralph out of his hiding place. Ralph stays in the forest, where he discovers and destroys the sow’s head, but eventually, he is forced out onto the beach, where he knows the other boys will soon arrive to kill him. Ralph collapses in exhaustion, but when he looks up, he sees a British naval officer standing over him. The officer’s ship noticed the fire raging in the jungle. The other boys reach the beach and stop in their tracks at the sight of the officer. Amazed at the spectacle of this group of bloodthirsty, savage children, the officer asks Ralph to explain. Ralph is overwhelmed by the knowledge that he is safe but, thinking about what has happened on the island, he begins to weep. The other boys begin to sob as well. The officer turns his back so that the boys may regain their composure."
Hasty,"Band of Brothers: E Company, 506th Regiment, 101st Airborne from Normandy to Hitler's Eagle's Nest is a focused analysis of one of the most prolific war units the United States of America has ever produced, the legendary Easy Company of the 101st Airborne Parachute Infantry Regiment (PIR). Taken from the detailed accounts of campaigns assembled by U.S. Armed Forces historians and first-person accounts, the nonfiction book retells the journey of Easy Company through the eyes of the men who served. From their early days training stateside through to their ultimate victory over the German fighting forces, the book traces the influence Easy Company of the 506th Airborne Division had in shaping the outcome of World War II.
The story starts with the selection of the men for Easy Company. At the time, the PIR is a new type of fighting unit, paratroopers. It is all volunteer because of the extreme training required for the danger the men would be facing. The soldiers who survive the try-out process are profiled as a group of street-savvy pragmatists who figure their best chance to survive the war would be in the company of the best-trained men. The role of leadership in shaping them into efficient soldiers falls to officers with various strengths and weaknesses, both of which contribute to the men’s development. Basic training turns these soldiers into fit infantrymen, and jump school challenges the men to overcome their instincts for safety and learn to love jumping out of airplanes.
After rigorous training, Easy Company leaves the States for England, where the men participate in simulations for D-Day. There they learn that the reality of combat includes the unexpected and the unknown, and their training in flexible response to combat conditions comes to the fore on their first jump on D-Day. Normandy presents on-the-job training in “kill-or-be-killed,” and Lt. Dick Winters begins his career in Easy Company as a brilliant strategist. The bloody battles of Carentan follow as Easy Company learns to capture and hold a town. The men experience failures of nerve and must force themselves into bravery. Their bravado has had a reality check in France, and they must rely on their past training to mentally push through their fears and self-doubts.
Easy Company next deploys to Holland on an ill-conceived operation to secure “hell’s highway,” a road needed for strategic Allied troop movements into Germany. They are met with overwhelming force in the form of fifty-tank German Panzer units and infantry. Although they were at first welcomed by the Dutch civilians as liberators, the Allied soldiers must later watch the people withdraw into silent despair as they fail to hold the towns from German occupation. Easy Company and other Allied soldiers receive orders to travel to “the island,” a five-kilometer-wide area between the Rhine River on the north and the Waal River to the south, captured three weeks earlier. Easy Company’s task is to defend the position from counterattacks, support the British artillery by turning back any German infantry assaults, and serve as forward artillery observers. They push back a 100-man German SS unit, but they lose fifty men to artillery fire before they are relieved by a Canadian division.
In Mourmelon, France, Easy Company’s rest and recovery come to an abrupt end when U.S. Commander Eisenhower sends them to meet Hitler’s surprise offensive in the Ardennes area in Belgium. This event goes down in history as the Battle of the Bulge. In the hasty deployment, the Allied soldiers go to Bastogne to face subzero temperatures and snowy conditions without adequate winter clothing or ammunition. They scrounge bullets from the traumatized retreating American troops they are replacing. The Germans surround Bastogne and pound their position with artillery that inflicts horrible casualties. The siege cuts off Allied soldiers from food and ammunition resupply until General Patton’s tank division breaks the blockade. Easy Company captures Bastogne, Noville, and Rachamps, cutting off the German advance. The bloody campaign brings on combat fatigue, and many soldiers reach their psychological breaking point. The American troops lose half their men.
The Germans launch an operation in Alsace, 160 miles southeast of Bastogne, to draw American troops from the Ardennes area. Easy Company deploys to hold the line in the town of Haguenau on the Moder River and serve as forward artillery observers. They conduct a covert patrol and capture two Germans to use as informants on the enemy’s plan, position, and resources.
Easy Company returns to Mourmelon to rest and resupply and finds that many of their personal items stored there during the campaign in Bastogne have been stolen by other soldiers. Recruits from the States replace their comrades who had fallen in battle, and the veterans train with the enthusiastic replacements to bring them to battle readiness. The division prepares for Operation Eclipse, a drop on and around Berlin, planned for after the Allied armies have crossed the Rhine. To support their advance, the British-American Operation Varsity drops three airborne divisions into the Ruhr area of Germany, where they encounter stiff German resistance. As support, Commander Eisenhower sends the 101st Airborne by truck to Remagen to eliminate this resistance. Easy Company, for the first time, operates in Germany and gets to know the citizens. As the war winds down, they see thousands of survivors living amid hundreds of skeletal corpses left where they fell at the Dachau forced labor camp.
When the Germans formally surrender to Commander Eisenhower, Easy Company is busy securing the Nazi high command’s homes in Berchtesgaden. After learning about their victory, the men celebrate with German fighter pilot Hermann Goering’s champagne. The men next go to Austria to supervise the surrender and processing of German troops before finally making their way home to the United States. The book ends with the stories of their lives after their return."
Unquestionable,"Old Major, a prize-winning boar, gathers the animals of the Manor Farm for a meeting in the big barn. He tells them of a dream he has had in which all animals live together with no human beings to oppress or control them. He tells the animals that they must work toward such a paradise and teaches them a song called “Beasts of England,” in which his dream vision is lyrically described. The animals greet Major’s vision with great enthusiasm. When he dies only three nights after the meeting, three younger pigs—Snowball, Napoleon, and Squealer—formulate his main principles into a philosophy called Animalism. Late one night, the animals manage to defeat the farmer Mr. Jones in a battle, running him off the land. They rename the property Animal Farm and dedicate themselves to achieving Major’s dream. The cart-horse Boxer devotes himself to the cause with particular zeal, committing his great strength to the prosperity of the farm and adopting as a personal maxim the affirmation “I will work harder.”
At first, Animal Farm prospers. Snowball works at teaching the animals to read, and Napoleon takes a group of young puppies to educate them in the principles of Animalism. When Mr. Jones reappears to take back his farm, the animals defeat him again, in what comes to be known as the Battle of the Cowshed, and take the farmer’s abandoned gun as a token of their victory. As time passes, however, Napoleon and Snowball increasingly quibble over the future of the farm, and they begin to struggle with each other for power and influence among the other animals. Snowball concocts a scheme to build an electricity-generating windmill, but Napoleon solidly opposes the plan. At the meeting to vote on whether to take up the project, Snowball gives a passionate speech. Although Napoleon gives only a brief retort, he then makes a strange noise, and nine attack dogs—the puppies that Napoleon had confiscated in order to “educate”—burst into the barn and chase Snowball from the farm. Napoleon assumes leadership of Animal Farm and declares that there will be no more meetings. From that point on, he asserts, the pigs alone will make all of the decisions—for the good of every animal.
Napoleon now quickly changes his mind about the windmill, and the animals, especially Boxer, devote their efforts to completing it. One day, after a storm, the animals find the windmill toppled. The human farmers in the area declare smugly that the animals made the walls too thin, but Napoleon claims that Snowball returned to the farm to sabotage the windmill. He stages a great purge, during which various animals who have allegedly participated in Snowball’s great conspiracy—meaning any animal who opposes Napoleon’s uncontested leadership—meet instant death at the teeth of the attack dogs. With his leadership unquestioned (Boxer has taken up a second maxim, “Napoleon is always right”), Napoleon begins expanding his powers, rewriting history to make Snowball a villain. Napoleon also begins to act more and more like a human being—sleeping in a bed, drinking whisky, and engaging in trade with neighboring farmers. The original Animalist principles strictly forbade such activities, but Squealer, Napoleon’s propagandist, justifies every action to the other animals, convincing them that Napoleon is a great leader and is making things better for everyone—despite the fact that the common animals are cold, hungry, and overworked.
Mr. Frederick, a neighboring farmer, cheats Napoleon in the purchase of some timber and then attacks the farm and dynamites the windmill, which had been rebuilt at great expense. After the demolition of the windmill, a pitched battle ensues, during which Boxer receives major wounds. The animals rout the farmers, but Boxer’s injuries weaken him. When he later falls while working on the windmill, he senses that his time has nearly come. One day, Boxer is nowhere to be found. According to Squealer, Boxer has died in peace after having been taken to the hospital, praising the Rebellion with his last breath. In actuality, Napoleon has sold his most loyal and long-suffering worker to a glue maker in order to get money for whisky.
Years pass on Animal Farm, and the pigs become more and more like human beings—walking upright, carrying whips, and wearing clothes. Eventually, the seven principles of Animalism, known as the Seven Commandments and inscribed on the side of the barn, become reduced to a single principle reading “all animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.” Napoleon entertains a human farmer named Mr. Pilkington at a dinner and declares his intent to ally himself with the human farmers against the laboring classes of both the human and animal communities. He also changes the name of Animal Farm back to the Manor Farm, claiming that this title is the “correct” one. Looking in at the party of elites through the farmhouse window, the common animals can no longer tell which are the pigs and which are the human beings."
Youthful,"A Raisin in the Sun portrays a few weeks in the life of the Youngers, a Black family living on the South Side of Chicago in the 1950s. When the play opens, the Youngers are about to receive an insurance check for $10,000. This money comes from the deceased Mr. Younger’s life insurance policy. Each of the adult members of the family has an idea as to what he or she would like to do with this money. The matriarch of the family, Mama, wants to buy a house to fulfill a dream she shared with her husband. Mama’s son, Walter Lee, would rather use the money to invest in a liquor store with his friends. He believes that the investment will solve the family’s financial problems forever. Walter’s wife, Ruth, agrees with Mama, however, and hopes that she and Walter can provide more space and opportunity for their son, Travis. Finally, Beneatha, Walter’s sister and Mama’s daughter, wants to use the money for her medical school tuition. She also wishes that her family members were not so interested in assimilating into the white world. Beneatha instead tries to find her identity by looking back to the past and to Africa.
As the play progresses, the Youngers clash over their competing dreams. Ruth discovers that she is pregnant but fears that if she has the child, she will put more financial pressure on her family members. When Walter says nothing to Ruth’s admission that she is considering abortion, Mama puts a down payment on a house for the whole family. She believes that a bigger, brighter dwelling will help them all. This house is in Clybourne Park, an entirely white neighborhood. When the Youngers’ future neighbors find out that the Youngers are moving in, they send Mr. Lindner, from the Clybourne Park Improvement Association, to offer the Youngers money in return for staying away. The Youngers refuse the deal, even after Walter loses the rest of the money ($6,500) to his friend Willy Harris, who persuades Walter to invest in the liquor store and then runs off with his cash.
In the meantime, Beneatha rejects her suitor, George Murchison, whom she believes to be shallow and blind to the problems of race. Subsequently, she receives a marriage proposal from her Nigerian boyfriend, Joseph Asagai, who wants Beneatha to get a medical degree and move to Africa with him (Beneatha does not make her choice before the end of the play). The Youngers eventually move out of the apartment, fulfilling the family’s long-held dream. Their future seems uncertain and slightly dangerous, but they are optimistic and determined to live a better life. They believe that they can succeed if they stick together as a family and resolve to defer their dreams no longer."
Winds,"It is the spring of 1861. Scarlett O’Hara, a pretty Southern belle, lives on Tara, a large plantation in Georgia. She concerns herself only with her numerous suitors and her desire to marry Ashley Wilkes. One day she hears that Ashley is engaged to Melanie Hamilton, his frail, plain cousin from Atlanta. At a barbecue at the Wilkes plantation the next day, Scarlett confesses her feelings to Ashley. He tells her that he does love her but that he is marrying Melanie because she is similar to him, whereas he and Scarlett are very different. Scarlett slaps Ashley and he leaves the room. Suddenly Scarlett realizes that she is not alone. Rhett Butler, a scandalous but dashing adventurer, has been watching the whole scene, and he compliments Scarlett on being unladylike. 
The Civil War begins. Charles Hamilton, Melanie’s timid, dull brother, proposes to Scarlett. She spitefully agrees to marry him, hoping to hurt Ashley. Over the course of two months, Scarlett and Charles marry, Charles joins the army and dies of the measles, and Scarlett learns that she is pregnant. After Scarlett gives birth to a son, Wade, she becomes bored and unhappy. She makes a long trip to Atlanta to stay with Melanie and Melanie’s aunt, Pittypat. The busy city agrees with Scarlett’s temperament, and she begins to see a great deal of Rhett. Rhett infuriates Scarlett with his bluntness and mockery, but he also encourages her to flout the severely restrictive social requirements for mourning Southern widows. As the war progresses, food and clothing run scarce in Atlanta. Scarlett and Melanie fear for Ashley’s safety. After the bloody battle of Gettysburg, Ashley is captured and sent to prison, and the Yankee army begins bearing down on Atlanta. Scarlett desperately wants to return home to Tara, but she has promised Ashley she will stay with the pregnant Melanie, who could give birth at any time.
	On the night the Yankees capture Atlanta and set it afire, Melanie gives birth to her son, Beau. Rhett helps Scarlett and Melanie escape the Yankees, escorting them through the burning streets of the city, but he abandons them outside Atlanta so he can join the Confederate Army. Scarlett drives the cart all night and day through a dangerous forest full of deserters and soldiers, at last reaching Tara. She arrives to find that her mother, Ellen, is dead; her father, Gerald, has lost his mind; and the Yankee army has looted the plantation, leaving no food or cotton. Scavenging for subsistence, a furious Scarlett vows never to go hungry again.
	Scarlett takes charge of rebuilding Tara. She murders a Yankee thief and puts out a fire set by a spiteful Yankee soldier. At last the war ends, word comes that Ashley is free and on his way home, and a stream of returning soldiers begins pouring through Tara. One such soldier, a one-legged homeless Confederate named Will Benteen, stays on and helps Scarlett with the plantation. One day, Will brings terrible news: Jonas Wilkerson, a former employee at Tara and current government official, has raised the taxes on Tara, hoping to drive the O’Haras out so that he might buy the plantation. Distraught, Scarlett hurries to Atlanta to seduce Rhett Butler so that he will give her the three hundred dollars she needs for taxes. Rhett has emerged from the war a fabulously wealthy man, dripping with earnings from his blockade-running operation and from food speculation. However, Rhett is in a Yankee jail and cannot help Scarlett. Scarlett sees her sister’s beau, Frank Kennedy, who now owns a general store, and forges a plan. Determined to save Tara, she betrays her sister and marries Frank, pays the taxes on Tara, and devotes herself to making Frank’s business more profitable.
	After Rhett blackmails his way out of prison, he lends Scarlett enough money to buy a sawmill. To the displeasure of Atlanta society, Scarlett becomes a shrewd businesswoman. Gerald dies, and Scarlett returns to Tara for the funeral. There, she persuades Ashley and Melanie to move to Atlanta and accept a share in her lumber business. Shortly thereafter, Scarlett gives birth to Frank’s child, Ella Lorena.
	A free black man and his white male companion attack Scarlett on her way home from the sawmill one day. That night, the Ku Klux Klan avenges the attack on Scarlett, and Frank ends up dead. Rhett proposes to Scarlett and she quickly accepts. After a long, luxurious honeymoon in New Orleans, Scarlett and Rhett return to Atlanta, where Scarlett builds a garish mansion and socializes with wealthy Yankees. Scarlett becomes pregnant again and has another child, Bonnie Blue Butler. Rhett dotes on the girl and begins a successful campaign to win back the good graces of the prominent Atlanta citizens in order to keep Bonnie from being an outcast like Scarlett.
	Scarlett and Rhett’s marriage begins happily, but Rhett becomes increasingly bitter and indifferent toward her. Scarlett’s feelings for Ashley have diminished into a warm, sympathetic friendship, but Ashley’s jealous sister, India, finds them in a friendly embrace and spreads the rumor that they are having an affair. To Scarlett’s surprise, Melanie takes Scarlett’s side and refuses to believe the rumors.
	After Bonnie is killed in a horse-riding accident, Rhett nearly loses his mind, and his marriage with Scarlett worsens. Not long after the funeral, Melanie has a miscarriage and falls very ill. Distraught, Scarlett hurries to see her. Melanie makes Scarlett promise to look after Ashley and Beau. Scarlett realizes that she loves and depends on Melanie and that Ashley has been only a fantasy for her. She concludes that she truly loves Rhett. After Melanie dies, Scarlett hurries to tell Rhett of her revelation. Rhett, however, says that he has lost his love for Scarlett, and he leaves her. Grief-stricken and alone, Scarlett makes up her mind to go back to Tara to recover her strength in the comforting arms of her childhood nurse and slave, Mammy, and to think of a way to win Rhett back."
Putting,"The Tragedy of Pudd'nhead Wilson juggles three plot lines, which all come together in a murder trial at the novel's end. Pudd'nhead Wilson is a Northerner who comes to the small Missouri town of Dawson's Landing to build a career as a lawyer. Immediately upon his arrival he alienates the townspeople, who don't understand his wit. They give him the nickname ""Pudd'nhead"" and refuse to give him their legal work. He scrapes by on odd work and spends most of his time dabbling in scientific hobbies, most notably, fingerprinting.
Roxana, or Roxy, is a beautiful slave who can pass for white, though she is one-sixteenth Black. To save her infant son from ever being sold away from her, she switches him with the child of her white master, who looks just like her son and was born on the same day. Her son Chambers, now called ""Tom,"" grows up as a white man and heir to an estate. Her master's child, Tom, now called ""Chambers"", grows up a slave. ""Tom"" grows into a cruel, cowardly man. His gambling debts lead him, under Roxy's guidance, to rob houses, sell the now-freed Roxy as a slave, and finally to murder his uncle, Judge Driscoll, in a botched robbery attempt.
Luigi and Angelo are former sideshow performers. Good-looking and charming, they claim to be Italian twins, heirs of a deposed nobleman. They arrive in Dawson's Landing to rent a room in Widow Cooper's house, claiming they are tired of the bustle of the world. Luigi confesses to Pudd'nhead Wilson, who has read his palm, that he once killed a man who tried to steal a fabulous Indian knife from the brothers. This knife is stolen by ""Tom"" and used to kill Judge Driscoll. Luigi gets into an argument with ""Tom,"" who has him arrested. The judge is mortified that ""Tom"" has compromised the family honor by doing that, and he instead challenges Luigi to a duel. No one is killed, but ""Tom,"" to save his own reputation, tells his uncle that Luigi is a confessed assassin and therefore not an honorable man to duel. The twins, initially popular in the town, lose their reputation through the judge's claims against them, and lose in an election for city offices in which Pudd'nhead Wilson is elected mayor. Shortly after the election, ""Tom,"" badly in debt and needing money to pay off the man to whom he has fraudulently sold Roxy, murders the judge with the twins' knife while he is robbing him.
""Tom"" escapes disguised as a woman after killing his uncle. The twins, out for a walk, hear the judge's cries and rush to help. They are found standing over the body and their bloody knife is on the floor. They are brought to trial for the murder. Pudd'nhead Wilson, who is their attorney, through his fingerprint collection and a few lucky accidents, discovers that ""Tom"" is the murderer and that he is not the real Tom but Chambers. The twins are redeemed and freed, but soon leave for Europe. ""Tom"" is thrown in jail and then, since it is now known he is a slave, sold ""down the river"" to pay debts from the estate of the real Tom's father. ""Chambers,"" revealed to be Tom, is given back his place as a white man and heir, but, raised as a Black man and marked by his Black speech patterns, he now fits into society nowhere. Pudd'nhead is mayor of Dawson's Landing and finally a success as a lawyer, but none of his old friends are around anymore to enjoy his success with him."
Burns,"Guy Montag is a fireman who burns books in a futuristic American city. In Montag’s world, firemen start fires rather than putting them out. The people in this society do not read books, enjoy nature, spend time by themselves, think independently, or have meaningful conversations. Instead, they drive very fast, watch excessive amounts of television on wall-size sets, and listen to the radio on “Seashell Radio” sets attached to their ears.
Montag encounters a gentle seventeen-year-old girl named Clarisse McClellan, who opens his eyes to the emptiness of his life with her innocently penetrating questions and her unusual love of people and nature. Over the next few days, Montag experiences a series of disturbing events. First, his wife, Mildred, attempts suicide by swallowing a bottle of sleeping pills. Then, when he responds to an alarm that an old woman has a stash of hidden literature, the woman shocks him by choosing to be burned alive along with her books. A few days later, he hears that Clarisse has been killed by a speeding car. Montag’s dissatisfaction with his life increases, and he begins to search for a solution in a stash of books that he has stolen from his own fires and hidden inside an air-conditioning vent.
When Montag fails to show up for work, his fire chief, Beatty, pays a visit to his house. Beatty explains that it’s normal for a fireman to go through a phase of wondering what books have to offer, and he delivers a dizzying monologue explaining how books came to be banned in the first place. According to Beatty, special-interest groups and other “minorities” objected to books that offended them. Soon, books all began to look the same, as writers tried to avoid offending anybody. This was not enough, however, and society as a whole decided to simply burn books rather than permit conflicting opinions. Beatty tells Montag to take twenty-four hours or so to see if his stolen books contain anything worthwhile and then turn them in for incineration. Montag begins a long and frenzied night of reading.
Overwhelmed by the task of reading, Montag looks to his wife for help and support, but she prefers television to her husband’s company and cannot understand why he would want to take the terrible risk of reading books. He remembers that he once met a retired English professor named Faber sitting in a park, and he decides that this man might be able to help him understand what he reads. He visits Faber, who tells him that the value of books lies in the detailed awareness of life that they contain. Faber says that Montag needs not only books but also the leisure to read them and the freedom to act upon their ideas.
Faber agrees to help Montag with his reading, and they concoct a risky scheme to overthrow the status quo. Faber will contact a printer and begin reproducing books, and Montag will plant books in the homes of firemen to discredit the profession and to destroy the machinery of censorship. Faber gives him a two-way radio earpiece (the “green bullet”) so that he can hear what Montag hears and talk to him secretly.
Montag goes home, and soon two of his wife’s friends arrive to watch television. The women discuss their families and the war that is about to be declared in an extremely frivolous manner. Their superficiality angers him, and he takes out a book of poetry and reads “Dover Beach” by Matthew Arnold. Faber buzzes in his ear for him to be quiet, and Mildred tries to explain that the poetry reading is a standard way for firemen to demonstrate the uselessness of literature. The women are extremely disturbed by the poem and leave to file a complaint against Montag.
Montag goes to the fire station and hands over one of his books to Beatty. Beatty confuses Montag by barraging him with contradictory quotations from great books. Beatty exploits these contradictions to show that literature is morbid and dangerously complex, and that it deserves incineration. Suddenly, the alarm sounds, and they rush off to answer the call, only to find that the alarm is at Montag’s own house. Mildred gets into a cab with her suitcase, and Montag realizes that his own wife has betrayed him.
Beatty forces Montag to burn the house himself; when he is done, Beatty places him under arrest. When Beatty continues to berate Montag, Montag turns the flamethrower on his superior and proceeds to burn him to ashes. Montag knocks the other firemen unconscious and runs. The Mechanical Hound, a monstrous machine that Beatty has set to attack Montag, pounces and injects Montag’s leg with a large dose of anesthetic. Montag manages to destroy it with his flamethrower; then he walks off the numbness in his leg and escapes with some books that were hidden in his backyard. He hides these in another fireman’s house and calls in an alarm from a pay phone.
Montag goes to Faber’s house, where he learns that a new Hound has been put on his trail, along with several helicopters and a television crew. Faber tells Montag that he is leaving for St. Louis to see a retired printer who may be able to help them. Montag gives Faber some money and tells him how to remove Montag’s scent from his house so the Hound will not enter it. Montag then takes some of Faber’s old clothes and runs off toward the river. The whole city watches as the chase unfolds on TV, but Montag manages to escape in the river and change into Faber’s clothes to disguise his scent. He drifts downstream into the country and follows a set of abandoned railroad tracks until he finds a group of renegade intellectuals (“the Book People”), led by a man named Granger, who welcome him. They are a part of a nationwide network of book lovers who have memorized many great works of literature and philosophy. They hope that they may be of some help to mankind in the aftermath of the war that has just been declared. Montag’s role is to memorize the Book of Ecclesiastes. Enemy jets appear in the sky and completely obliterate the city with bombs. Montag and his new friends move on to search for survivors and rebuild civilization."
Express,"Hercule Poirot, private detective and retired Belgian police officer, boards the Taurus Express train to Stamboul (Istanbul). On the train there are two other passengers, Mary Debenham and Colonel Arbuthnot. The two act as if they are strangers, but Poirot observes behavior that suggests that they are not. Poirot is suspicious of the couple. The train arrives in Stamboul and Poirot checks in at the Tokatlian Hotel. As soon as Poirot arrives he receives a telegram summoning him back to London. While waiting at the hotel for the next train, Poirot bumps into an old friend, M. Bouc, head of the Wagon Lit. M. Bouc arranges a space for Poirot on the Orient Express. In the dining room of the Tokatlian Hotel, Poirot first spots Ratchett and Hector McQueen eating dinner. Poirot know that Ratchett is an evil man and he describes him to M. Bouc as an animal.
Poirot board the Orient Express. He is forced to ride in a second-class cabin because the train is unusually full. Ratchett and Hector McQueen are also aboard the train. Ratchett approaches Poirot and asks if he will work for him, Ratchett tells Poirot he has been receiving threatening letters and that someone is trying to kill him. Poirot refuses the case. M. Bouc has taken the last first class cabin, but arranges to be moved to a separate coach and gives Poirot his space in first class. The first night Poirot sleeps in first class, he observes some strange occurrences. Early in the morning, Poirot is wakened by a cry from Ratchett's compartment next to him. The wagon lit conductor responds knocks on Ratchett's door and a voice from inside responds, ""Ce n'est rien. Je me suis trompe"" (It is nothing. I am mistaken). Poirot has difficulty sleeping because there is a peculiar silence on the train. Mrs. Hubbard rings her bell and tells the conductor a man is in her room. Poirot rings his bell for water and is informed by the conductor that the train is stuck in a snow bank. Poirot hears a loud thump next door.
The next morning, the train still stopped, M. Bouc informs Poirot that Ratchett has been murdered and the murderer is still aboard the train. Poirot tells M. Bouc he will investigate the case. Poirot first examines Ratchett's body and compartment. Ratchett has twelve stab wounds. The window is left open in Ratchett's compartment, presumably to make the investigators think the murderer escaped out the window, but there are no footprints outside the window in the snow. A handkerchief with the initial ""H"" is found in the compartment, a pipe cleaner, a round match different from the matches Ratchett used and a charred piece of paper with the name ""Armstrong"" on it.
The piece of paper with the word Armstrong on it helps Poirot figure out who Ratchett really is and why someone would want to murder him. A few years back, a man named Cassetti kidnapped a three-year old girl, Daisy Armstrong. Cassetti collected a ransom from the wealthy Armstrong family, but killed the child anyways. Poirot concludes that Ratchett is Cassetti.
The interviews start with the Wagon Lit conductor, then Hector McQueen. Poirot knows that McQueen is involved with the case because he knows about the Armstrong note found in Ratchett's compartment, Hector is surprised that Poirot found the note because he thought it had been completely destroyed. He interviews Masterman and then Mrs. Hubbard. Mrs. Hubbard claims that the murderer was in her cabin. All of the passengers give Poirot suitable alibis during their interviews, although a few suspicious elements are brought to light: many passengers observed a woman in a red kimono walking down the hallway the night of the murder, but no one admits they have a red kimono. Mrs. Hubbard tells Poirot she had Greta Ohlsson lock the communicating door between she and Ratchett. Hildegarde Schmidt bumped into a stranger wearing a Wagon Lit jacket.
Poirot checks every passenger's luggage. During the check he notices a few interesting things: the label on Countess Andrenyi's luggage is wet, a Wagon Lit uniform is found in Hildegarde Schmidt's bag and, lastly, the red kimono is found in Poirot's own luggage.
After the luggage check, Poirot, Dr. Constantine and M. Bouc review the facts of the case and develop a list of questions. With the evidence and questions in mind, Poirot sits and thinks about the case. When he surfaces from a somewhat trance-like state, Poirot has discovered the solution to the case. Before he reveals this solution in full, he calls in several people and reveals their true identities. Poirot discovers Countess Andrenyi is Helena Goldenberg, aunt of Daisy Armstrong. She wet her luggage label and obscured her name, in an effort to conceal her identity. Also, Mary Debenham was Daisy's governess, Antonio Foscanelli was the Armstrong's chaffer, Masterman the valet, and Greta Ohlsson was Daisy Armstrong's nurse. Princess Dragomiroff claims her handkerchief from Poirot, the same found in Ratchett's compartment.
Poirot gathers all of the passengers into the dining car and propounds two possible solutions. The fist solution is that a stranger entered the train at Vincovci and killed Ratchett. The second solution is that all of the passengers aboard the Orient Express were involved with the murder. He argues that twelve of the thirteen passengers, all close to the Armstrong case, killed Ratchett to avenge the murder of Daisy Armstrong. Mrs. Hubbard, revealed as Linda Arden, admits that the second solution is correct. Poirot suggests that M. Bouc and Dr. Constantine tell the police that the first solution is correct to protect the family. M. Bouc and Dr. Constantine accept Poirot's suggestion."
Almighty,"Max, who narrates this story in the first person, tells the reader that before he met Freak, he didn’t have a brain. This, he says, is “the unvanquished truth.”
Max first meets Freak, or Kevin, at daycare, the year that Max moves in with Grim and Gram, his mother’s parents. Freak uses crutches and calls himself “Robot Man.” One day, Freak leaves daycare and doesn’t return.
Max resumes the story in the summer before eighth grade. Grim, Max’s grandfather, worries that Max is beginning to look like Him, Max’s father. Max tells us he is L.D., learning disabled, and he doesn’t think he has much going on in his brain. One day, Max is in the backyard. He recognizes a woman moving items into a house down the block as Freak’s mom, and then sees Freak himself. Max is curious and he approaches the house. Freak asks the “earthling” (Max) to identify himself. Max runs back to his basement. He emerges later to find Freak trying to retrieve an object stuck high in a tree. Max helps him and they spend the afternoon together. Freak’s mom, who Max knows as “Fair Gwen of Air”, invites Max to dinner. Max learns that Gwen and his mom were friends years ago. 
Max and Freak go the Fourth of July fireworks show by the millpond together. Max hoists Freak onto his shoulders so that Freak can see. When the show ends, Tony D. (known as Blade) and his gang corner Max and Freak. With Freak steering Max by kicking him right or left, they run straight into the millpond, where Max becomes stuck in the mud. Blade and his followers throw rocks at them from the shore. The police arrive and rescue Max and Freak. One of the cops seems to recognize Max as the son of someone he calls “Killer Kane,” and asks if his dad is still in prison. Freak interrupts him and says, “We’re Freak the Mighty, that’s who we are.” 
Freak the Mighty spend the summer going on quests. On these quests, Freak uses words Max doesn’t understand and insists that Max look them up in the dictionary Freak always carries. Max pretends to understand.
One day, Max and Freak walk to the “Medical Research” facility where Freak says they have an Experimental Bionics Unit. Freak tells Max that he visits there every few months to be fitted for a bionic transplant. Max thinks such a procedure will be painful and dangerous, but Freak says that pain is a state of mind and life itself is dangerous.
The two boys embark on a nighttime quest to retrieve a purse that Blade and his gang tossed down a storm drain. The purse is empty except for an ID card with the address of a Loretta Lee on it. The next day, Max and Freak walk to an area of rundown apartment buildings called the Testaments. Loretta and a man named Iggy live at the address, and they both know Max’s father, Kenny Kane. Iggy says that Max is a “ringer” for his dad, Killer Kane. Loretta remembers that Freak is Gwen’s son. Iggy kicks the boys out and they run home.
The school year begins, and Max finds himself in the same class as Freak. Classmates yell slurs at him. Suddenly, Freak climbs onto Max’s shoulders and directs Max to walk around the room. “Freak the Mighty, Freak the Mighty!” he shouts. Soon the whole class is chanting. Freak the Mighty end up in the principal’s office. 
Friday the thirteenth in October comes and it’s a bad one. First, Max’s dad wants Max to write a letter to the parole board on his behalf. Max has a panic attack. Second, a medical emergency sends Freak to the hospital. His insides are growing but his outside isn’t.
As Christmas approaches, Grim tells Max that his dad is out on parole. Freak and Fair Gwen, Max, Grim and Gram spend Christmas Eve together. Freak gives Max a dictionary that he has written, filled with his favorite words. The best gift ever, Max thinks.
After the Christmas Eve festivities, Max’s father sneaks into the basement. He kidnaps Max, and they end up at Loretta and Iggy’s place. Kenny ties up Max in a vacant apartment and swears on a Bible that he did not murder Max’s mother. 
Iggy reports that Freak has sent the cops to look for them. Kenny escapes with Max to an abandoned building where he gags and ties Max up. When Kenny leaves, Loretta appears and works to free Max. No sooner is Max untied, than Kenny returns, and grabs Loretta to choke her. Max tries to stop him, yelling that he saw Kenny kill his mother. Kane lets go of Loretta and grabs Max’s neck. Seconds later, Freak appears with a squirt gun supposedly filled with sulfuric acid, which he sprays at Kenny’s eyes. Max and Freak escape, the cops arrest Kenny and save Loretta. Freak laughs because the squirt gun – filled in fact with soap, vinegar, and curry powder – worked. As Gwen arrives and carries Freak away, he yells, “Freak the Mighty strikes again!” 
The school year continues. Gwen warns Kevin that he has to be “extra careful.” He’s been having trouble breathing. Max awaits his father’s trial and is relieved when Killer Kane pleads guilty because he won’t have to testify. 
Freak, Fair Gwen, Grim, Gram, and Max celebrate Freak’s thirteenth birthday. Suddenly, Freak has a seizure and is rushed to the hospital. 
The doctors make an exception and allow Max to visit when Freak asks for him. Freak tells Max that he won’t be coming home looking the way he looks now, and that he’s having a special operation. He gives Max a gift of a blank book and tells Max to write in it, to tell the story of Freak the Mighty.
When Max arrives back at the hospital the next day, Freak has passed away. The doctor explains that his heart just got too big for his body. 
For a long time, Max does not come out of the basement. When he eventually does, he runs into Loretta Lee, who asks what he’s been doing. When he says, “Nothing,” Loretta tells him, “Nothing is a drag, kid. Think about it.” That night, Max takes out the blank book and starts writing “the unvanquished truth.” He finishes the story and feels good about having written a book. Max thinks maybe he’ll even read a book now."
Conceiving,"Michelle Obama grows up in a two-story bungalow on Chicago’s South Side. Her parents, Fraser and Marian Robinson, rent an upstairs apartment from Marian’s aunt and uncle, who live downstairs. Michelle’s father has multiple sclerosis, but he does not let his disability limit him. He works at a water filtration plant and is also a local precinct captain for the Democratic party. Michelle is a smart, determined girl with little tolerance for disorder. She is less sociable than her older brother, Craig, a gifted basketball player who has many friends. Over time, however, Michelle learns to be more outgoing.
Michelle’s parents believe in education. Her mother does volunteer work on behalf of their neighborhood school, which struggles to maintain quality as the neighborhood declines. Fraser and Marian send Craig to a predominantly white Catholic school with a strong basketball program and a rigorous curriculum. When Michelle is ready for high school, she gains admission to Whitney Young, a new magnet school for gifted students. At Whitney Young, her friendship with a daughter of civil rights leader the Reverend Jesse Jackson gives Michelle a chance to observe what life is like for people active in politics.
Michelle follows her brother to Princeton, where she does well. One of her closest friends at Princeton is a Jamaican student named Suzanne; that friendship helps Michelle see that not everyone has to be as organized and driven as she is. Michelle graduates, studies law at Harvard, and goes to work at a high-end law firm in Chicago. By then, however, she realizes that she hates being a lawyer. Her life takes a turn when she is asked to help mentor a male summer associate named Barack Obama. The son of a Black Kenyan father and a white American mother, he is older than Michelle but started law school later, after some years doing other things, including community organizing in Chicago. Barack’s brilliance is quickly apparent to everyone at the firm, and he and Michelle are immediately attracted to each other.
As Michelle and Barack get acquainted, she sees that he has a higher tolerance for turmoil and uncertainty than she does. She also sees his dedication to making the world a better place. However, Michelle faces crushing loss: her friend Suzanne dies of cancer, and her father dies from MS after decades of fighting to live a normal life. Realizing that life is short, Michelle looks for opportunities to transition out of her legal career. Some personal connections lead to a job at city hall, working for Valerie Jarrett, who will become a lifelong friend and ally. Barack, meanwhile, works in the Chicago area for a national get-out-the vote organization. By now, he and Michelle are engaged. They marry in 1992.
Barack is working for a public interest law firm when the opportunity arises for him to run for a seat in the Illinois state senate. By now, Michelle has run a nonprofit organization and is serving as a university dean. Michelle does not like politics and predicts that Barack will not like it, either; but after he wins his race, he turns out to have the right kind of temperament and skills to be a politician. Then Barack loses his mother to cancer, and Michelle suffers a miscarriage. After failed attempts to conceive again, the Obamas turn to in vitro fertilization (IVF) and their first daughter, Malia, is born Michelle becomes director of community outreach at a hospital. 
After a failed campaign for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, daughter Sasha is born. Their burgeoning family and careers but strains on Michelle and Barack, but couples therapy helps them make some useful adjustments. Barack runs for the U.S. Senate and unexpectedly builds a commanding lead even before his speech at the Democratic National Convention boosts his national profile. He wins the Senate race easily.
When Barack moves to Washington, Michelle and the girls stay in Chicago. To her consternation, Barack and a team of advisers are already discussing a 2008 presidential run. She agrees to be part of the campaign but privately thinks that as a Black man, Barack cannot win. During the campaign, there are absurd rumors, circulated by his opponents, about Barack having Muslim ties. Michelle is an asset on the campaign trail, although she is discouraged when a video of one of her speeches is edited down to suggests that she carries a grudge against America. After the August convention, where Michelle gives a well-received speech, Barack and his running mate, Joe Biden, achieve a decisive win. Michelle believes that Barack is the right person to lead the country out of the ongoing economic recession.
The transition between the Bush and Obama administrations is smooth and welcoming. The White House staff is kind and efficient. Michelle and Barack learn to get used to being accompanied by Secret Service agents whenever they go out, but they do their best to keep the girls’ lives as normal as possible. Michelle’s mother, whom Barack and Michelle persuaded to move in with them, declines Secret Service protection altogether.
As First Lady, Michelle must be engaged and productive without overstepping her bounds. Her early work focuses on childhood obesity, through the Let’s Move! initiative to promote exercise and healthy eating. Michelle plants a vegetable garden on the South Lawn. She also promotes post-high school education through her Reach Higher initiative, and education for girls around the world through the Let Girls Learn initiative. Finally, she teams up with the Second Lady, Jill Biden, to improve support for military families through the Joining Forces initiative. 
During Barack’s successful reelection campaign in 2012, Michelle discovers the power of social media. Like the rest of the country, the Obamas are shocked by mass shootings at Sandy Hook School in Newtown, Connecticut and at a Black church in Charleston. The death of a Chicago girl in a drive-by shooting has personal meaning for Michelle: the girl lived not far from Michelle’s old neighborhood and had recently participated in the second inaugural celebration. 
During the 2016 presidential contest, Michelle is appalled by Donald Trump’s past and present behavior and is shocked when he achieves a come-from-behind win over Hillary Clinton. She takes comfort in all the things she and Barack have accomplished over the last eight years and reminds herself that there is much to be optimistic about."
Famed,"Euripedes' Medea opens in a state of conflict. Jason has abandoned his wife, Medea, along with their two children. He hopes to advance his station by remarrying with Glauce, the daughter of Creon, king of Corinth, the Greek city where the play is set. All the events of play proceed out of this initial dilemma, and the involved parties become its central characters.
Outside the royal palace, a nurse laments the events that have lead to the present crisis. After a long series of trials and adventures, which ultimately forced Jason and Medea to seek exile in Corinth, the pair had settled down and established their family, achieving a degree of fame and respectability. Jason's recent abandonment of that family has crushed Medea emotionally, to the degree that she curses her own existence, as well as that of her two children.
Fearing a possible plot of revenge, Creon banishes Medea and her children from the city. After pleading for mercy, Medea is granted one day before she must leave, during which she plans to complete her quest for ""justice""--at this stage in her thinking, the murder of Creon, Glauce, and Jason. Jason accuses Medea of overreacting. By voicing her grievances so publicly, she has endangered her life and that of their children. He claims that his decision to remarry was in everyone's best interest. Medea finds him spineless, and she refuses to accept his token offers of help.
Appearing by chance in Corinth, Aegeus, King of Athens, offers Medea sanctuary in his home city in exchange for her knowledge of certain drugs that can cure his sterility. Now guaranteed an eventual haven in Athens, Medea has cleared all obstacles to completing her revenge, a plan which grows to include the murder of her own children; the pain their loss will cause her does not outweigh the satisfaction she will feel in making Jason suffer.
For the balance of the play, Medea engages in a ruse; she pretends to sympathize with Jason (bringing him into her confidence) and offers his wife ""gifts,"" a coronet and dress. Ostensibly, the gifts are meant to convince Glauce to ask her father to allow the children to stay in Corinth. The coronet and dress are actually poisoned, however, and their delivery causes Glauce's death. Seeing his daughter ravaged by the poison, Creon chooses to die by her side by dramatically embracing her and absorbing the poison himself.
A messenger recounts the gruesome details of these deaths, which Medea absorbs with cool attentiveness. Her earlier state of anxiety, which intensified as she struggled with the decision to commit infanticide, has now given way to an assured determination to fulfill her plans. Against the protests of the chorus, Medea murders her children and flees the scene in a dragon-pulled chariot provided by her grandfather, the Sun-God. Jason is left cursing his lot; his hope of advancing his station by abandoning Medea and marrying Glauce, the conflict which opened the play, has been annihilated, and everything he values has been lost through the deaths that conclude the tragedy."
Cost,"At the age of nineteen, Edmond Dantès seems to have the perfect life. He is about to become the captain of a ship, he is engaged to a beautiful and kind young woman, Mercédès, and he is well liked by almost everyone who knows him. This perfect life, however, stirs up dangerous jealousy among some of Dantès’s so-called friends. Danglars, the treasurer of Dantès’s ship, envies Dantès’s early career success; Fernand Mondego is in love with Dantès’s fiancée and so covets his amorous success; his neighbor Caderousse is simply envious that Dantès is so much luckier in life than he is.
Together, these three men draft a letter accusing Dantès of treason. There is some truth to their accusations: as a favor to his recently deceased captain, Dantès is carrying a letter from Napoleon to a group of Bonapartist sympathizers in Paris. Though Dantès himself has no political leanings, the undertaking is enough to implicate him for treason. On the day of his wedding, Dantès is arrested for his alleged crimes.
The deputy public prosecutor, Villefort, sees through the plot to frame Dantès and is prepared to set him free. At the last moment, though, Dantès jeopardizes his freedom by revealing the name of the man to whom he is supposed to deliver Napoleon’s letter. The man, Noirtier, is Villefort’s father. Terrified that any public knowledge of his father’s treasonous activities will thwart his own ambitions, Villefort decides to send Dantès to prison for life. Despite the entreaties of Monsieur Morrel, Dantès’s kind and honest boss, Dantès is sent to the infamous Château d’If, where the most dangerous political prisoners are kept.
While in prison, Dantès meets Abbé Faria, an Italian priest and intellectual, who has been jailed for his political views. Faria teaches Dantès history, science, philosophy, and languages, turning him into a well-educated man. Faria also bequeaths to Dantès a large treasure hidden on the island of Monte Cristo, and he tells him how to find it should he ever escape. When Faria dies, Dantès hides himself in the abbé’s shroud, thinking that he will be buried and then dig his way out. Instead, Dantès is thrown into the sea, and is able to cut himself loose and swim to freedom.
Dantès travels to Monte Cristo and finds Faria’s enormous treasure. He considers his fortune a gift from God, given to him for the sole purpose of rewarding those who have tried to help him and, more important, punishing those who have hurt him. Disguising himself as an Italian priest who answers to the name of Abbé Busoni, he travels back to Marseilles and visits Caderousse, who is now struggling to make a living as an innkeeper. From Caderousse he learns the details of the plot to frame him. In addition, Dantès learns that his father has died of grief in his absence and that Mercédès has married Fernand Mondego. Most frustrating, he learns that both Danglars and Mondego have become rich and powerful and are living happily in Paris. As a reward for this information, and for Caderousse’s apparent regret over the part he played in Dantès’s downfall, Dantès gives Caderousse a valuable diamond. Before leaving Marseilles, Dantès anonymously saves Morrel from financial ruin.
Ten years later, Dantès emerges in Rome, calling himself the Count of Monte Cristo. He seems to be all knowing and unstoppable. In Rome Dantès ingratiates himself to Albert de Morcerf, son of Fernand Mondego and Mercédès, by saving him from bandits. In return for the favor, Albert introduces Dantès to Parisian society. None of his old cohorts recognize the mysterious count as Edmond Dantès, though Mercédès does. Dantès is thus able to insinuate himself effortlessly into the lives of Danglars, Mondego, and Villefort. Armed with damning knowledge about each of them that he has gathered over the past decade, Dantès sets an elaborate scheme of revenge into motion.
Mondego, now known as the Count de Morcerf, is the first to be punished. Dantès exposes Morcerf’s darkest secret: Morcerf made his fortune by betraying his former patron, the Greek vizier Ali Pacha, and he then sold Ali Pacha’s wife and daughter into slavery. Ali Pacha’s daughter, Haydée, who has lived with Dantès ever since he bought her freedom seven years earlier, testifies against Morcerf in front of the senate, irreversibly ruining his good name. Ashamed by Morcerf’s treachery, Albert and Mercédès flee, leaving their tainted fortune behind. Morcerf commits suicide.
Villefort’s punishment comes slowly and in several stages. Dantès first takes advantage of Madame de Villefort’s murderous intent, subtly tutoring her in the uses of poison. As Madame de Villefort wreaks her havoc, killing off each member of the household in turn, Dantès plants the seeds for yet another public exposé. In court, it is revealed that Villefort is guilty of attempted infanticide, as he tried to bury his illegitimate baby while it was still alive. Believing that everyone he loves is dead and knowing that he will soon have to answer severe criminal charges, Villefort goes insane.
For his revenge on Danglars, Dantès simply plays upon his enemy’s greed. He opens various false credit accounts with Danglars that cost him vast amounts of money. He also manipulates Danglars’s unfaithful and dishonest wife, costing Danglars more money, and helps Danglars’s daughter, Eugénie, run away with her female companion. Finally, when Danglars is nearly broke and about to flee without paying any of his creditors, Dantès has the Italian bandit Luigi Vampa kidnap him and relieve him of his remaining money. Dantès spares Danglars’s life, but leaves him penniless.
Meanwhile, as these acts of vengeance play out, Dantès also tries to complete one more act of goodness. Dantès wishes to help the brave and honorable Maximilian Morrel, the son of the kind shipowner, so he hatches an elaborate plot to save Maximilian’s fiancée, Valentine Villefort, from her murderous stepmother, to ensure that the couple will be truly happy forever. Dantès gives Valentine a pill that makes her appear dead and then carries her off to the island of Monte Cristo. For a month Dantès allows Maximilian to believe that Valentine is dead, which causes Maximilian to long for death himself. Dantès then reveals that Valentine is alive. Having known the depths of despair, Maximilian is now able to experience the heights of ecstasy. Dantès too ultimately finds happiness, when he allows himself to fall in love with the adoring and beautiful Haydée."
Qualified,"In 1998, Barbara Ehrenreich, a journalist and activist then in her late 50s, sets out to document the daily struggles of America’s working poor. Having trained as a biologist, she decides to do fieldwork: in three different U.S. cities, she takes minimum-wage jobs and looks for affordable places to live. She leaves her Ph.D. and most of her skills off of her applications, to ensure that she is given the lowest-level positions available to a white, native-English speaking woman. However, she will use outside cash, if necessary, to ensure that she will never be without a car, she will not have to skip meals to save money, and she will never be homeless.
Ehrenreich’s first experiences are in Key West, Florida. Her most affordable living option, cheaper than a trailer in town, is a shabby efficiency apartment thirty miles away. Although she expects to earn $7 per hour, the first job she lands, as a diner waitress, pays much less, because she will also earn tips. The job requires not only serving tables but also additional work, like cleaning and restocking. Although Ehrenreich gets along well with her coworkers, she struggles as a waitress, because of her lack of experience. Realizing that she will not be able to stay in her apartment on what she is earning, she tries takes a second waitressing job, at another diner. She quickly realizes she will be physically unable to work both jobs, quits the first job, and takes a hotel housekeeping job next door to the second diner, instead. However, when her supervisor at the second diner yells at her, Ehrenreich has had enough and walks out.
Ehrenreich’s next location is Portland, Maine. There, after much searching, she finds a small apartment she will be able to afford. She takes two jobs. The first is with a maid service that cleans the homes of affluent clients where she works on a cleaning team with several other women. The work is back-breaking, and Ehrenreich develops a skin rash of unknown origin. She sees the other women continue to work even when they are injured or feeling sick. She notices that the cleaning techniques the team is taught to use are more about making homes look cleaner than about actually cleaning them. She learns that her employer charges customers $25 per person-hour, while she will earn $6.65 an hour. Ehrenreich’s other job is at a nursing home, where she helps serve food to residents with Alzheimer’s. The interactions with the residents are pleasant, but the cleanup work after meals is overwhelming, partly because one of the automatic dishwashers is broken.
In Minneapolis, Minnesota, finally, Ehrenreich has a very hard time finding safe, sanitary housing she can afford. A charity worker suggests that she check into a shelter while saving up first month’s rent. She has two job applications accepted, but backs out of one job, at a hardware store, when her very first shift is scheduled to last eleven hours without overtime pay. The other job is in women’s clothing at Wal-Mart. The day-long orientation for new employees includes criticism of labor unions, while the pay is less than typical for the area. The store layout is constantly changing, and customers make extra work for her by leaving unbought merchandise in other departments. The job makes Ehrenreich, by her own account, callous and spiteful. Meanwhile, she has been unable to secure a long-term rental situation. Fed up, at one of the employee meetings she starts talking about the need for a union. By now, she has already decided to quit.
Reviewing her experiences in light of the data from many different studies, Ehrenreich comes to several conclusions. She finds that workers cannot support themselves on minimum wage in America unless they work multiple jobs, and only so long as there are no unexpected expenses, such as for medical care. Ehrenreich also finds that employers try to keep information about the wages they pay from becoming general knowledge among workers. Additionally, she finds that the ways in which workers are supervised, including random urine tests for drug use, encourage the workers to accept being dehumanized. Ehrenreich adds that the attitudes found in managers of low-wage employees are based on class or racial prejudice. Finally, she states that medical benefits and child care are too expensive even for middle-class workers, let alone ones on minimum wage. She notes that perhaps someday the working poor will refuse to stop accepting their situation and will demand that things change—and concludes that the country will be a better place when they do."
Division,"The Old Testament is a collection of thirty-nine books about the history and religion of the people of Israel. The authors of these books are unknown, and each book possesses a unique tone, style, and message. Individually, they include stories, laws, and sayings that are intended to function as models of religious and ethical conduct. Together—through hundreds of characters and detailed events—they represent a unified narrative about God and his attempt to relate to humankind by relating to a specific group of people.
The Old Testament contains four main sections: the Pentateuch, the Former Prophets (or Historical Books), the Writings, and the Latter Prophets. This study guide covers books from the first three sections.
The Pentateuch
The Pentateuch comprises the first five books of the Old Testament. It depicts a series of beginnings—the beginning of the world, of humankind, and of God’s promise to the Israelites.
Genesis, the first book, opens with God’s creation of the world. The perfect world falls into evil when humans disobey God, and the human population divides into separate nations and languages. After many generations, God speaks to a man named Abraham. God makes a promise, or covenant, with Abraham to make his descendants into a great nation and to give them a great land. Abraham shows strong faith in God, and God seals his promise with a number of signs and tests. This special covenant with God passes on to Abraham’s son, Isaac, and to his grandson, Jacob. Together, they represent the patriarchs, or fathers, of the Israelite people. Jacob’s twelve sons move to Egypt after the youngest brother, Joseph, miraculously becomes a high official in Egypt.
In the Book of Exodus, the descendants of Jacob’s children have become a vast people, but the Pharaoh of Egypt holds them in slavery. God chooses one man, Moses, to rescue the Israelites. God sends ten plagues to Egypt, and, with miraculous signs and wonders, Moses leads the people out of Egypt and across the Red Sea. They go to Mount Sinai, where God appears in a cloud of thunder over the mountain and affirms to the Israelites the promise he made to Abraham. God commands them to worship only himself, and he gives them various ethical and religious laws.
The books of Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy continue the explanation of God’s religious laws and his promises to the people. The people must keep these laws to enter and enjoy the promised land, toward which they are heading. Despite God’s presence, the Israelites complain and disobey incessantly, inciting God’s wrath. They wander the wilderness for forty years in search of the promised land. These books continue the period of Moses’s legendary leadership and miracles, until his death at the end of Deuteronomy.
The Former Prophets
The Former Prophets, or the Historical Books, cover the history of the Israelites from Moses’s death to the fall of the nation in 587 b.c. In the books of Joshua and Judges, the Israelites successfully conquer the land promised to them by God, but they disobey God by worshipping the deities of the surrounding peoples. Neighboring nations invade and oppress the Israelites. God saves the people of Israel by designating judges, or rulers, to lead the people in warding off their enemies.
The two books of Samuel (First Samuel and Second Samuel) cover the rise of the united kingdom of Israel. Israel’s religious leader, Samuel, appoints a king named Saul. Saul disobeys God, however, and God chooses another man, David, to be Israel’s king. King Saul attempts to kill the young David, but fails. Saul’s death closes the first book. In the second book, David establishes the great kingdom of Israel. He conquers Israel’s surrounding enemies and establishes Jerusalem as the religious and political center of Israel.
The books of Kings (called 1 Kings and 2 Kings) trace the decline of Israel’s success. God blesses David’s son, Solomon, with immense wisdom. As king, Solomon expands Israel into an empire and builds a great temple in Jerusalem. Solomon disobeys God by worshipping other deities, and, at his death, the kingdom splits into a northern kingdom, Israel, and a southern kingdom, Judah. A host of evil kings leads the two kingdoms away from worshipping God. Despite the attempts of the prophets Elijah and Elisha to halt Israel’s wrongdoing, the two kingdoms fall to the Assyrian and Babylonian Empires. Jerusalem is destroyed, and the people are sent into exile.
The Writings
The Writings are placed after the historical books in the Christian Bible. Some of these are narratives covering the time of Israel’s exile in other nations and its eventual return to the homeland. The Book of Esther, for example, tells the story of an unassuming Jewish girl who becomes the queen of Persia and boldly saves the Jewish people from genocide.
Many of the Writings are books of poetry and wisdom, among the most important literature in the Old Testament. The Book of Job is a lengthy dialogue investigating God’s justice and the problem of human suffering. The Psalms are lyrical poems and hymns—many attributed to King David—that express humankind’s longing for God. The books of Proverbs and Ecclesiastes—similarly attributed to the wise King Solomon—offer sayings and instructions about the meaning of life and ethical behavior. Lastly, the Song of Solomon (also attributed to Solomon) is a romantic, lyric dialogue between a young woman and her lover."
Guns,"Joe Bonham lies injured in a hospital bed. While conscious, Joe thinks back over scenes from his past: the night of his father's death and the night before he left his girlfriend Kareen to go to World War I. Before his family moved to Los Angeles, Joe grew up in Shale City, a small town in Colorado. He remembers small-town memories and images, such as the food his mother would prepare, the first time an airplane came to Shale City, and the night he lost his girlfriend, Diane, to his best friend, Bill Harper.
The narrative shifts from the past to the present as Joe thinks regretfully about his decision to join a war that was not any of his business. Slowly, Joe begins to realize that he has been severely injured and treated in a hospital, which is where he currently lies. Joe gradually feels that his arms and legs have been amputated. Furthermore, he realizes that he cannot speak, see, hear, or smell because he no longer has a face—only a mask covering where his face used to be. Joe wonders bitterly abut the doctors' motivation for saving him at all.
Joe continues to live inside his head, reliving memories and terrorized by nightmares. He wonders how he can even tell whether he is awake or asleep. Joe thinks about his father kept beautiful gardens in a vacant city lot and fed his children well, although he was never officially a success because he never made any money. Joe continues to think bitterly about the foolishness of fighting and dying in a war that had nothing to do with him, and about the deceitfulness of abstract words like ""liberty,"" ""democracy,"" ""freedom,"" and ""decency.""
Time passes, and Joe tries to occupy his mind with stories, facts, and figures. One day, he realizes that he should use the skin he has left—the skin of his neck that is not covered by blankets—to try to sense the outside world. Joe develops a plan to wait for the feeling of sunrise so that he can tally the nurses' visits and count the passing of the days. A year later, Joe has accomplished his goal and counted up 365 days. He celebrates the New Year in his mind, just as he has celebrated each Sunday of his year with an imagined walk in the woods.
In Joe's fourth year, he is amazed to feel that the hospital staff is prepared him to be shown to visitors. When he feels the visitors lay something on his chest, he realizes he is being given a medal. Joe becomes angry and shudders in his bed, trying to remove his mask to show the visitors how much damage men like him sustained in the war while generals emerged unscathed. Joe feels the vibrations of the men leaving the room. An idea comes upon him that if he can sense the outside world through vibrations, perhaps he might also communicate to the outside world with vibrations. Joe begins tapping SOS in Morse code with his head, but his regular nurse assumes that he is having seizures and sedates him.
Joe awakens from his sedation to realize that he has a new day nurse. The new day nurse tries to communicate with Joe by spelling out ""MERRY CHRISTMAS"" on his chest. Joe signals with his head that he understands, and he begins trying to tap Morse code to her. After trying to appease his tapping by making him more comfortable in various ways, the nurse eventually realizes he is trying to communicate in words.
The nurse goes to get a man who understands Morse code. This man taps onto Joe's forehead the words ""WHAT DO YOU WANT?"" Joe spends some time thinking about the inappropriateness of the question and then tries to think about what in fact it is that he wants. Joe asks in Morse code to be taken around the outside world as an educational exhibit on the realities of war. The man listens to his response and returns a while later to tap into his head, ""WHAT YOU ASK IS AGAINST REGULATIONS.""
The man continues tapping other messages, but Joe is no longer paying attention. He is still trying to process this betrayal on the part of the people for whom he fought a war when he feels the hospital staff sedating him again. Joe taps the question ""why? why? why?""—wondering why they will not let him talk or acknowledge that there is still a person inside his mangled body. Joe suddenly realizes that they are afraid to let him out, to let other men see him as the ""new messiah of the battlefields."" If other men see Joe, they would no longer agree to fight in wars—especially wars ordered by the upper classes, but fought only by the lower classes of peaceful, working men."
Mall,"The full title of Moll Flanders gives an apt summary of the plot: ""The Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Famous Moll Flanders, Etc. Who was born in Newgate, and during a life of continu'd Variety for Threescore Years, besides her Childhood, was Twelve Year a Whore, five times a Wife (whereof once to her own brother), Twelve Year a Thief, Eight Year a Transported Felon in Virginia, at last grew Rich, liv'd Honest and died a Penitent. Written from her own Memorandums.""
Moll Flanders is born to a mother who has been convicted of a felony and who is transported to America soon after her birth. As an infant, Moll lives on public charity, under the care of a kind widow who teaches her manners and needlework. She grows into a beautiful teenager and is seduced at an early age. Abandoned by her first lover, she is compelled to marry his younger brother. He dies after a few years, and she marries a draper who soon flees the country as a fugitive from the law. She marries yet again and moves to America, only to find out that her husband is actually her half-brother. She leaves him in disgust and returns to England, where she becomes the mistress of a man whose wife has gone insane. He renounces his affair with Moll after a religious experience.
Moll's next marriage offer is from a banker whose wife has been cheating on him. Moll agrees to marry him if he can obtain a divorce, and meanwhile she travels to the country and marries a rich gentleman in Lancashire. This man turns out to be a fraud--he is as poor as she is--and they part ways to seek their fortunes separately. Moll returns to marry the banker, who by this time has succeeded in divorcing his wife. He dies soon after, however, and Moll is thrown back upon her own resources once again. She lives in poverty for several years and then begins stealing. She is quite talented at this new ""trade"" and soon becomes an expert thief and a local legend. Eventually she is caught, imprisoned, and sentenced to death. In prison at Newgate, she reunites with her Lancashire husband, who has also been arrested. They both manage to have their sentences reduced, and they are transported to the colonies, where they begin a new life as plantation owners. In America, Moll rediscovers her brother and her son and claims the inheritance her mother has left her. Prosperous and repentant, she returns with her husband to England at the age of seventy."
Fellowship,"The Fellowship of the Ring is the first of three volumes in The Lord of the Rings, an epic set in the fictional world of Middle-earth. The Lord of the Rings is an entity named Sauron, the Dark Lord, who long ago lost the One Ring that contains much of his power. His overriding desire is to reclaim the Ring and use it to enslave all of Middle-earth. 
The story of The Lord of the Rings begins with several events that take place in The Hobbit. While wandering lost in a deep cave, Bilbo Baggins, a Hobbit—one of a small, kindly race about half the size of Men—stumbles upon a ring and takes it back with him to the Shire, the part of Middle-earth that is the Hobbits’ home. All Bilbo knows of his ring is that wearing it causes him to become invisible. He is unaware that it is the One Ring, and is therefore oblivious to its significance and to the fact that Sauron has been searching for it.

The Fellowship of the Ring opens with a party for Bilbo’s 111th birthday. Bilbo gives his ring to his heir, his cousin Frodo Baggins. When the time comes to part with the ring, however, Bilbo becomes strangely reluctant to do so. He gives up the ring only at the determined urging of his friend, Gandalf the Grey, a great Wizard. Gandalf suspects that the ring is indeed the One Ring of legend. After confirming his suspicions, he tells Frodo that the Ring must be taken away from the Shire, as Sauron’s power is growing once again.
Frodo sets out from the Shire with three of his Hobbit friends—Sam, Merry, and Pippin. Along the way, they are pursued by the nine Ringwraiths, servants of Sauron who take the form of terrifying Black Riders. The hobbits spend a night in the company of wandering Elves, who promise to send word ahead to friends who will protect the hobbits. Barely out of the Shire, the hobbits get lost in the Old Forest, where they have to be rescued from a malevolent willow tree, which swallows up Merry and Pippin, and then from an evil tomb ghost. The hobbits’ rescuer is Tom Bombadil, a strange, jovial entity with great powers who is the oldest creature in Middle-earth.
The hobbits make it to the town of Bree, where they meet Aragorn, a Ranger who roams the wilderness and who is the heir of the Kings of the ancient Men of Westernesse. Those who do not know Aragorn’s true name call him Strider. Frodo tries to keep a low profile at the inn in Bree, but he ends up causing a scene when while taking part in a rollicking rendition of a song he falls, accidentally slips the Ring onto his finger, and vanishes.
That night, Aragorn advises the hobbits not to sleep in their rooms at the inn. In doing so, he saves their lives—for the first of many times. A letter Gandalf left at the inn months before advises the group to head for Rivendell, a realm of the Elves. Aragorn sets out with the hobbits the next day, and with his help they avoid the Black Riders for some time. However, at the top of the hill Weathertop, the Company is forced to defend itself against the attacking Riders. Frodo is wounded during the skirmish.
Frodo’s wound, made by a weapon of a servant of Sauron, plagues the hobbit as the Company makes its way eastward. Aragorn is greatly concerned about the power the wound might exert over Frodo. Near Rivendell they meet the Elf-lord Glorfindel, who has been out looking for them. At the last ford before Rivendell, Frodo, riding Glorfindel’s horse, outruns the ambushing Black Riders, who are swept away in a flood created by Elrond, the master of Rivendell.
Elrond heals Frodo and then holds a meeting to discuss what to do about the Ring. During this Council, Frodo learns the full history of the Ring. Frodo accepts the burden of taking the Ring to the only place it can be destroyed—the place where it was forged. It promises to be a long, nearly impossible journey, as the Ring was forged in the Cracks of Doom, part of the fiery mountain Orodruin in the very heart of Sauron’s realm of Mordor.
At the end of the meeting, the Council creates a group to help Frodo in his quest. In addition to Frodo, the Fellowship of the Ring includes Sam, Merry, Pippin, Aragorn, Gandalf, an Elf named Legolas, a Dwarf named Gimli, and a Man from the south named Boromir.
The Fellowship heads south and attempts to pass over the Misty Mountains via the pass of Caradhras. Their way is blocked by snow and rock slides, and they are forced to divert their path through the Mines of Moria—the ancient, underground realm of the Dwarves. During the journey through Moria, Gandalf falls into the chasm of Khazad-dûm while protecting the Company from a Balrog, a terrible demon.
The rest of the party continues on to Lórien, the forest of the Galadrim Elves, where the Lady Galadriel tests their hearts and gives them gifts to help them on the quest. Frodo, spellbound by Galadriel’s power and wisdom, offers her the Ring. She refuses, however, saying that, despite her intentions, the Ring would corrupt her; ultimately, she would only replace Sauron.
Leaving Lórien, the Fellowship travels by boat down the Great River, Anduin. At night, they spot Gollum—a deformed creature that had once owned the Ring but then lost it to Bilbo Baggins in The Hobbit—following them. When they reach the Falls of Rauros, the Fellowship must decide whether to head toward Mordor on the east or toward the safety of the city of Minas Tirith to the west.
Boromir, overcome by the Ring’s power and desiring the Ring for himself, confronts Frodo. Frodo fends off Boromir and decides that he must go on to Mordor rather than to the safety of Minas Tirith. However, Frodo cannot bear the thought of imperiling his friends on the dangerous journey or allowing the Ring to corrupt them, so he attempts to leave secretly and continue the quest alone. Frodo does not, however, manage to elude Sam, so the two of them set out together for Mordor."
Information,"In Outliers: The Story of Success, Malcolm Gladwell considers the circumstances that lead to success. The first half of the book looks closely at how opportunities matter more in the lives of successful people than hard work or raw talent. The second half of the book focuses on cultural legacies: behavioral tendencies rooted in their ancestral past.
Part One examines the role of opportunity in the lives of extremely successful people. Gladwell’s first example is the Canadian Hockey League, the world’s most competitive youth hockey league. Since the cutoff date for the Canadian leagues that serve the youngest players is January 1, those born in the first part of the calendar year are much larger and more coordinated than their peers. The larger and more coordinated kids are given more playing time and better coaching, and thus become better players by the time they reach the top league. An overwhelming majority of Canadian professional hockey players have birthdays in January, February or March.
Gladwell proposes that 10,000 hours of practice is needed to master a skill, even for prodigies like Mozart. Bill Joy, Bill Gates, and the Beatles all worked hard to achieve success but benefited from opportunities they did not create. Joy, one of the founders of Sun Microsystems, happened to attend one of the first colleges in the world with a time-sharing terminal. In graduate school, he had a terminal in his room, where he spent all of his free time programming. Gates happened to attend a private high school with a time-sharing terminal connected to a mainframe in Seattle. He also was able to spend all of his free time programming. Early on, the Beatles were hired to play long shows day after day in Hamburg, Germany. 
Birth year or era is another form of opportunity. Gates and Joy (as well as other early programmers) all reached the end of their teen years just as personal computers became available to the public. In another example, fourteen of the top seventy-five richest people in the history of the world happened to be alive at the same time, in the same country: the United States in the mid-1800s.
Opportunity matters more than an individual’s IQ. Using a study conducted by Lewis Terman, the creator of the Stanford-Binet IQ test, Gladwell shows that “practical intelligence” is as important as “analytical intelligence.” He also contrasts Chris Langan, one of the world’s smartest living people, with Robert Oppenheimer. While both had difficulties in college, only Oppenheimer had a successful life, due to his practical intelligence.
The last portion of Part One looks at Joe Flom, a successful lawyer from New York City. While he was born into a poor family to Jewish immigrants (in a time when Jewish immigrants were not treated well), many of the disadvantages in his life were actually benefits and directly contributed to his success.
Part Two investigates cultural legacies. Using flight recorder transcripts from several plane crashes from the last few decades, Gladwell shows that cultural expectations and habits can be a severe hindrance to pilots. Copilots from countries that have a high “Power Distance Index” (those that show the most deference to authority) will often avoid telling pilots that they are making mistakes, even when the mistakes are potentially fatal. After recognizing the dangers of such cultural expectations, commercial aviation has instituted programs to change the way flight crews talk with one another. 
Gladwell next analyzes the disparity in public school math test scores between Eastern and Western countries. He suggests that the cultures in which rice paddy farming is historically important have a stronger work ethic. Using various examples, Gladwell shows that hard work has a greater impact on success in learning mathematics than intelligence. 
The final example is an examination of the KIPP school in the South Bronx and the “achievement gap” between socioeconomic groups. American students from middle-class and affluent households retain more information over summer vacation and are more likely to make additional gains than students from low-income households. The KIPP school uses longer school days and summer programming to eliminate the achievement gap for low-income children. While the work schedule is very rigorous, the school’s students go on to great academic success.
Gladwell demonstrates that if more opportunities were available, there would be far more successful people and the world would be richer for it."
Intangible,"The protagonist, who is named Tim O’Brien, begins by describing an event that occurred in the middle of his Vietnam experience. “The Things They Carried” catalogs the variety of things his fellow soldiers in the Alpha Company brought on their missions. Several of these things are intangible, including guilt and fear, while others are specific physical objects, including matches, morphine, M-16 rifles, and M&M’s candy.
Throughout the collection, the same characters reappear in various stories. The first member of the Alpha Company to die is Ted Lavender, a “grunt,” or low-ranking soldier, who deals with his anxiety about the war by taking tranquilizers and smoking marijuana. Lavender is shot in the head on his way back from going to the bathroom, and his superior, Lieutenant Jimmy Cross, blames himself for the tragedy. When Lavender is shot, Cross is distracting himself with thoughts of Martha, a college crush. It is revealed in “Love” that Cross’s feelings for Martha, whom he dated once before leaving for Vietnam, were never reciprocated, and that even twenty years after the war, his guilt over Lavender’s death remains.
In “On the Rainy River,” the narrator, O’Brien, explains the series of events that led him to Vietnam in the first place. He receives his draft notice in June of 1968, and his feelings of confusion drive him north to the Canadian border, which he contemplates crossing so that he will not be forced to fight in a war in which he doesn’t believe. Sitting in a rowboat with the proprietor of the Tip Top Lodge, where he stays, O’Brien decides that his guilt about avoiding the war and fear of disappointing his family are more important than his political convictions. He soon leaves, going first back home to Worthington, Minnesota and later to Vietnam.
In addition to Ted Lavender, a few other members of the Alpha Company are killed during their mission overseas, including Curt Lemon, who is killed when he steps on a rigged mortar round. Though O’Brien is not close to Lemon, in “The Dentist,” he tells a story of how Lemon, who faints before a routine checkup with an army-issued dentist, tries to save face by insisting that a perfectly good tooth be pulled. Lee Strunk, another member of the company, dies from injuries he sustains by stepping on a landmine. In “Friends,” O’Brien remembers that before Strunk was fatally hurt, Strunk and Dave Jensen had made a pact that if either man were irreparably harmed, the other man would see that he was quickly killed. However, when Strunk is actually hurt, he begs Jensen to spare him, and Jensen complies. Instead of being upset by the news of his friend’s swift death en route to treatment, Jensen is relieved.
The death that receives the most attention in The Things They Carried is that of Kiowa, a much-loved member of the Alpha Company and one of O’Brien’s closest friends. In “Speaking of Courage,” the story of Kiowa’s death is relayed in retrospect through the memory of Norman Bowker, years after the war. As Bowker drives around a lake in his Iowa hometown, he thinks that he failed to save Kiowa, who was killed when a mortar round hit and caused him to sink headfirst into a marshy field. O’Brien realizes that he has dealt with his guilt over Kiowa’s death differently than Norman Bowker in “Notes.” Just before the end of the war, O’Brien receives a long letter from Bowker that says he hasn’t found a way to make life meaningful after the war. O’Brien resolves to tell Bowker’s story, and the story of Kiowa’s death, in order to negotiate his own feelings of guilt and hollowness.
Like “Love” and “Notes,” several of O’Brien’s stories are told from a perspective twenty years after the Vietnam War, when he is a forty-three-year-old writer living in Massachusetts. Exposure to the guilt of old friends like Jimmy Cross and Norman Bowker prompts him to write stories in order to understand what they were going through. But two stories, “The Man I Killed” and “Ambush,” are written so that O’Brien can confront his own guilt over killing a man with a grenade outside the village of My Khe. In “The Man I Killed,” O’Brien imagines the life of his victim, from his childhood to the way things would have turned out for him had O’Brien not spotted him on a path and thrown a grenade at his feet. In “Ambush,” O’Brien imagines how he might relay the story of the man he killed to his nine-year-old daughter, Kathleen. In this second story, O’Brien provides more details of the actual killing—including the sound of the grenade and his own feelings—and explains that even well after the fact, he hasn’t finished sorting out the experience.
In the last story, “The Lives of the Dead,” O’Brien gives another twist to his contention that stories have the power to save people. In the stories of Curt Lemon and Kiowa, O’Brien explains that his imagination allowed him to grapple successfully with his guilt and confusion over the death of his fourth-grade first love, Linda."
Pass,"Irene Redfield is a light-skinned Black woman who, in public places, occasionally passes for white, when she finds it convenient. Irene is a practical, determined person. She was born and raised in Chicago but now lives in Harlem with her husband, Brian, and their two boys. Brian is a successful doctor but dislikes his work. He would have preferred to move the entire family to another, less racist country long ago, but Irene has always insisted that the family belongs in New York.
One day, while back in Chicago for a visit, Irene has a chance meeting with a childhood friend, Clare. Clare is very different from Irene—self-centered, melodramatic, and reckless. Clare is even lighter-skinned than Irene, and in fact she has married a white man, John Bellew, without telling him that she is Black. They have a daughter. The Bellews live mostly in Europe but often spend time in the Unites States, depending on where John Bellew’s work in international banking takes him. Irene finds Clare strangely fascinating but does not like her company. She only reluctantly agrees to visit Clare at the Bellews’ hotel suite. Clare has invited a mutual light-skinned friend of theirs to join them. When John Bellew arrives, Irene is shocked to learn that he is a vehement racist. He openly declares that he hates Black people, not knowing that he is speaking to three of them.
Two years later, the Bellews have relocated to New York. Clare resumes contact with Irene, and Irene is not firm enough to insist that Clare leave her alone, if only to keep Clare’s secret safe. When Clare learns that Irene is planning a charity event at which upper-class Black people and white people will mingle, Clare insists on attending. Soon, she is at the Redfields’ home regularly and has become part of their social circle. In time, Irene suspects that Clare and Brian are having an affair. The Bellews are due to move back to Europe soon, but a chance downtown encounter between John Bellew and Irene, while Irene is with a darker-skinned friend, creates a crisis. If Bellew deduces that Clare, like Irene, is Black, he may divorce Clare and leave her free to pursue Brian.
The threat that Clare poses for Irene’s marriage and family life is unexpectedly removed when Bellew tracks Clare down at an all-Black party hosted by friends of the Redfields in their apartment atop a high residential building. Bellew angrily confronts Clare, but Clare smiles and acts unconcerned. When Irene angrily moves toward Clare and puts her hand on Clare’s arm, Clare tumbles out a nearby open window, to her death. The cause of her fall is unclear—whether she fainted and fell by accident, or fell deliberately. It is also possible that Irene pushed Clare, but no one accuses her."
Modern,"In a series of letters, Robert Walton, the captain of a ship bound for the North Pole, recounts to his sister back in England the progress of his dangerous mission. Successful early on, the mission is soon interrupted by seas full of impassable ice. Trapped, Walton encounters Victor Frankenstein, who has been traveling by dog-drawn sledge across the ice and is weakened by the cold. Walton takes him aboard ship, helps nurse him back to health, and hears the fantastic tale of the monster that Frankenstein created.
Victor first describes his early life in Geneva. At the end of a blissful childhood spent in the company of Elizabeth Lavenza (his cousin in the 1818 edition, his adopted sister in the 1831 edition) and friend Henry Clerval, Victor enters the university of Ingolstadt to study natural philosophy and chemistry. There, he is consumed by the desire to discover the secret of life and, after several years of research, becomes convinced that he has found it.
Armed with the knowledge he has long been seeking, Victor spends months feverishly fashioning a creature out of old body parts. One climactic night, in the secrecy of his apartment, he brings his creation to life. When he looks at the monstrosity that he has created, however, the sight horrifies him. After a fitful night of sleep, interrupted by the specter of the monster looming over him, he runs into the streets, eventually wandering in remorse. Victor runs into Henry, who has come to study at the university, and he takes his friend back to his apartment. Though the monster is gone, Victor falls into a feverish illness.
Sickened by his horrific deed, Victor prepares to return to Geneva, to his family, and to health. Just before departing Ingolstadt, however, he receives a letter from his father informing him that his youngest brother, William, has been murdered. Grief-stricken, Victor hurries home. While passing through the woods where William was strangled, he catches sight of the monster and becomes convinced that the monster is his brother’s murderer. Arriving in Geneva, Victor finds that Justine Moritz, a kind, gentle girl who had been adopted by the Frankenstein household, has been accused. She is tried, condemned, and executed, despite her assertions of innocence. Victor grows despondent, guilty with the knowledge that the monster he has created bears responsibility for the death of two innocent loved ones.
Hoping to ease his grief, Victor takes a vacation to the mountains. While he is alone one day, crossing an enormous glacier, the monster approaches him. The monster admits to the murder of William but begs for understanding. Lonely, shunned, and forlorn, he says that he struck out at William in a desperate attempt to injure Victor, his cruel creator. The monster begs Victor to create a mate for him, a monster equally grotesque to serve as his sole companion.
Victor refuses at first, horrified by the prospect of creating a second monster. The monster is eloquent and persuasive, however, and he eventually convinces Victor. After returning to Geneva, Victor heads for England, accompanied by Henry, to gather information for the creation of a female monster. Leaving Henry in Scotland, he secludes himself on a desolate island in the Orkneys and works reluctantly at repeating his first success. One night, struck by doubts about the morality of his actions, Victor glances out the window to see the monster glaring in at him with a frightening grin. Horrified by the possible consequences of his work, Victor destroys his new creation. The monster, enraged, vows revenge, swearing that he will be with Victor on Victor’s wedding night.
Later that night, Victor takes a boat out onto a lake and dumps the remains of the second creature in the water. The wind picks up and prevents him from returning to the island. In the morning, he finds himself ashore near an unknown town. Upon landing, he is arrested and informed that he will be tried for a murder discovered the previous night. Victor denies any knowledge of the murder, but when shown the body, he is shocked to behold his friend Henry Clerval, with the mark of the monster’s fingers on his neck. Victor falls ill, raving and feverish, and is kept in prison until his recovery, after which he is acquitted of the crime.
Shortly after returning to Geneva with his father, Victor marries Elizabeth. He fears the monster’s warning and suspects that he will be murdered on his wedding night. To be cautious, he sends Elizabeth away to wait for him. While he awaits the monster, he hears Elizabeth scream and realizes that the monster had been hinting at killing his new bride, not himself. Victor returns home to his father, who dies of grief a short time later. Victor vows to devote the rest of his life to finding the monster and exacting his revenge, and he soon departs to begin his quest.
Victor tracks the monster ever northward into the ice. In a dogsled chase, Victor almost catches up with the monster, but the sea beneath them swells and the ice breaks, leaving an unbridgeable gap between them. At this point, Walton encounters Victor, and the narrative catches up to the time of Walton’s fourth letter to his sister.
Walton tells the remainder of the story in another series of letters to his sister. Victor, already ill when the two men meet, worsens and dies shortly thereafter. When Walton returns, several days later, to the room in which the body lies, he is startled to see the monster weeping over Victor. The monster tells Walton of his immense solitude, suffering, hatred, and remorse. He asserts that now that his creator has died, he too can end his suffering. The monster then departs for the northernmost ice to die."
Prince,"The narrator, an airplane pilot, crashes in the Sahara desert. The crash badly damages his airplane and leaves the narrator with very little food or water. As he is worrying over his predicament, he is approached by the little prince, a very serious little blond boy who asks the narrator to draw him a sheep. The narrator obliges, and the two become friends. The pilot learns that the little prince comes from a small planet that the little prince calls Asteroid 325 but that people on Earth call Asteroid B-612. The little prince took great care of this planet, preventing any bad seeds from growing and making sure it was never overrun by baobab trees. One day, a mysterious rose sprouted on the planet and the little prince fell in love with it. But when he caught the rose in a lie one day, he decided that he could not trust her anymore. He grew lonely and decided to leave. Despite a last-minute reconciliation with the rose, the prince set out to explore other planets and cure his loneliness.
While journeying, the narrator tells us, the little prince passes by neighboring asteroids and encounters for the first time the strange, narrow-minded world of grown-ups. On the first six planets the little prince visits, he meets a king, a vain man, a drunkard, a businessman, a lamplighter, and a geographer, all of whom live alone and are overly consumed by their chosen occupations. Such strange behavior both amuses and perturbs the little prince. He does not understand their need to order people around, to be admired, and to own everything. With the exception of the lamplighter, whose dogged faithfulness he admires, the little prince does not think much of the adults he visits, and he does not learn anything useful. However, he learns from the geographer that flowers do not last forever, and he begins to miss the rose he has left behind.
At the geographer’s suggestion, the little prince visits Earth, but he lands in the middle of the desert and cannot find any humans. Instead, he meets a snake who speaks in riddles and hints darkly that its lethal poison can send the little prince back to the heavens if he so wishes. The little prince ignores the offer and continues his explorations, stopping to talk to a three-petaled flower and to climb the tallest mountain he can find, where he confuses the echo of his voice for conversation. Eventually, the little prince finds a rose garden, which surprises and depresses him—his rose had told him that she was the only one of her kind.
The prince befriends a fox, who teaches him that the important things in life are visible only to the heart, that his time away from the rose makes the rose more special to him, and that love makes a person responsible for the beings that one loves. The little prince realizes that, even though there are many roses, his love for his rose makes her unique and that he is therefore responsible for her. Despite this revelation, he still feels very lonely because he is so far away from his rose. The prince ends his story by describing his encounters with two men, a railway switchman and a salesclerk.
It is now the narrator’s eighth day in the desert, and at the prince’s suggestion, they set off to find a well. The water feeds their hearts as much as their bodies, and the two share a moment of bliss as they agree that too many people do not see what is truly important in life. The little prince’s mind, however, is fixed on returning to his rose, and he begins making plans with the snake to head back to his planet. The narrator is able to fix his plane on the day before the one-year anniversary of the prince’s arrival on Earth, and he walks sadly with his friend out to the place the prince landed. The snake bites the prince, who falls noiselessly to the sand.
The narrator takes comfort when he cannot find the prince’s body the next day and is confident that the prince has returned to his asteroid. The narrator is also comforted by the stars, in which he now hears the tinkling of his friend’s laughter. Often, however, he grows sad and wonders if the sheep he drew has eaten the prince’s rose. The narrator concludes by showing his readers a drawing of the desert landscape and by asking us to stop for a while under the stars if we are ever in the area and to let the narrator know immediately if the little prince has returned."
Cases,"Lawyer Bryan Stevenson gives a first-person account of his decades helping marginalized Americans who have been unfairly and harshly punished by the U.S. criminal justice system, which disproportionately targets people of color and poor people. At the heart of Just Mercy is the story of Walter McMillian, a Black man who was framed for the murder of a girl named Ronda Morrison, convicted, and sent to death row. 
Stevenson alternates chapters about Walter with his personal reflections on our country’s history with racial disparity and issues around incarceration. Stevenson highlights other groups of vulnerable people who have been victimized by the criminal justice system and shares the stories of the prisoners he has helped over the years. The book also follows the growth of Stevenson’s nonprofit law project, the Alabama-based Equal Justice Initiative (EJI), through its expansion from focusing on death row prisoners to helping people sentenced to life without parole. Stevenson chronicles how EJI becomes a significant force in criminal justice reform.
In 1983 as a law student, Stevenson discovers his life’s passion when he interns with the Georgia-based Southern Prisoners Defense Committee and meets his first death row prisoner. After graduation Stevenson accepts a job with the organization to represent poor prisoners, including those in Alabama who lack any public defender. He meets Walter McMillian on Alabama’s death row. Walter owns a successful business but also transgresses racial boundaries when he has an affair with a white woman. Soon after the affair becomes public, the woman’s friend, Ralph Myers, accuses Walter of committing the unsolved murder of Ronda Morrison, which has outraged the community. Law enforcement, including a racist sheriff and the district attorney, eagerly pounces on this accusation, overlooking Walter’s alibi and a lack of evidence. Instead, they actively force Ralph to stick with his story even when he tries to recant. They coerce other false witness testimonies, and—as revealed years later—actively suppress evidence.
After Stevenson and the team at EJI unsuccessfully appeal Walter’s conviction, they launch their own investigation of the crime and uncover new evidence. They find witnesses who can prove the witnesses against Walter lied as well as financial records that indicate that one of these witnesses was paid to give false testimony. Stevenson and his team also petition for and receive all records from Walter’s trial. However, their big break comes when they receive a phone call from Ralph, who now wants to make amends. Ralph admits to lying about Walter and says he was threatened by law enforcement. Stevenson wins a hearing for Walter where he can present his new evidence: Ralph’s testimony, which is confirmed by health care workers and other inmates, as well as recordings of the law enforcement team threatening Ralph if he doesn’t frame Walter. 
While the judge refuses to grant Walter relief, Stevenson continues the appeal process through the Alabama courts. The district attorney asks outside agents to investigate the murder for which Walter was convicted, and the investigators determine that Walter had nothing to do with the crime. Six weeks later, the court invalidates Walter’s conviction. Stevenson and the State file a joint motion to dismiss the charges, and Walter is set free.
Throughout the process, Stevenson and Walter become close friends, and Stevenson helps Walter upon his release, including filing a civil suit on his behalf and offering him a place to stay. Walter works with Stevenson to share his story, giving interviews and speaking at legal conferences, and Walter is even featured in a documentary. Unfortunately, Walter is diagnosed with advancing dementia and is forced to rely on family and eventually a nursing facility for his care. He dies in 2013. Stevenson gives a eulogy at his funeral and shares all he learned from Walter, particularly that we must extend mercy to everyone, even those who have not earned it.
Interspersed with chapters chronicling Walter’s narrative are stories of Stevenson’s other clients and work. His closeness with these prisoners and their horrifying circumstances makes Stevenson more determined to help and causes him to reflect on abstract issues that nevertheless imbue the criminal justice system, like humanity and mercy. Stevenson focuses on several categories of vulnerable people who become trapped in the system, including mentally ill prisoners, disabled prisoners, and poor women who give birth to stillborn babies. 
Stevenson and his team at EJI also become increasingly focused on juvenile offenders who are sometimes tried as adults despite their young age. These offenders may be given de facto death sentences by being sentenced to life without parole and face perilous circumstances when they are housed in adult prisons. Stevenson illustrates how these prisoners retain their own humanity while being forced to live under inhumane conditions. He also discusses some of the qualities common among these types of prisoners: They are generally poor and disproportionately people of color, and most of them lack adequate legal counsel. The juveniles have horrific backgrounds of abuse and neglect.
Stevenson and his team at EJI also work to change the legal system to offer more protection to marginalized people. Several of his cases end up before the U.S. Supreme Court, and he succeeds in winning rulings that ban as unconstitutional the conviction of children to life without parole and the execution of people deemed incompetent from dementia or neurological disease. EJI works to raise public awareness of issues surrounding unfair incarceration, produces groundbreaking reports on racial issues, and sets up programs to help formerly incarcerated people adjust to life on the outside.
Stevenson also reflects on the issues that surround the criminal justice system. His time spent with prisoners awaiting their execution makes him realize how inhumane it is to prepare another human to die. After decades of work, when Stevenson fails to prevent the execution of a man who suffers from an intellectual disability, he momentarily feels unable to continue his work. However, he realizes that he cannot help but be broken by his experiences and comes to understand that it is his own brokenness that allows him to more fully understand the need for mercy and to bring compassion to others. The book ends with Stevenson’s renewed commitment to helping others."
Divine,"The story takes place from spring 1942 until spring 1946. The five chapters are told from different family members’ points of view: first the woman/mother, next the girl/daughter, then the boy/son, next the combined points of view of the two children, and, finally, the man/father. The story begins in Berkeley, California, at the home of a Japanese-American family who has been in the United States for decades. Four months earlier, the father had been arrested by the FBI, and the mother, their son, and their daughter receive letters from him from a camp in Texas. 
When the mother sees signs in the neighborhood instructing her to ready her children and a few essentials for travel, she goes home to pack. The day before they are to leave, the mother interacts with a store owner and buys a few things. She packs valuables in the basement and then kills a chicken for dinner. She gives the cat to the neighbors and kills the family dog with a shovel. When the children return from school, the mother prepares a chicken dinner and lets her daughter’s pet macaw fly out the window while she imagines her husband in the house with them. She has no idea what the future holds for any of them.
The mother, son, and daughter take a train to Utah after spending four months at the Tanforan horse track in San Francisco. The rocking of the train makes them nauseous, and they must lower their window shades at night and when they pass through cities. The daughter describes the other passengers as she strolls through the train and sees wild mustangs out her window. She recalls a family trip to Yosemite and throws a deck of cards out the window. She reads some of the postcards from her father. She wakes to the sound of broken glass as a brick flies through a train window. The train crosses into Utah at night, and they disembark in the town of Delta. They board a bus and arrive at Topaz, a desolate arrangement of tar-paper barracks. It is extremely dusty, hot, and blindingly bright. There are no trees or shade.
The son then describes the tedious details of their life in the internment camp: their small, shared room; the armed guards; the radio they brought from home; and the other residents whom they can easily hear day and night through the thin walls. They have no running water, they must line up for their meager meals, and the toilets are far away and shared. Here in the desert, the son dreams of water and his father, who still writes to them weekly. The son gets notes and gifts from a neighbor girl from home. 
The children go to school. The son is haunted by memories of his father being taken away and his mother purging the house of everything Japanese. He has a pet tortoise that dies, and he plants a tulip bulb in a can that blooms in March. Winter brings frigid cold and snow, and the camp residents are issued oversized wool army surplus coats. The mother sinks into depression, seldom leaves her room, and refuses to eat. The boy’s sister becomes more distant and confused. A man is shot and killed by the guards. The father stops writing, and they have no idea why. When summer’s horrible heat returns, time seems to stand still, and the son tries to find new ways to spend his day. He fantasizes about his father’s return, always picturing him healthy, strong, and unchanged.
After three years and five months away, the mother, son, and daughter return. Their house in Berkeley has been ransacked, emptied, trashed, and defiled, and their mother’s rosebush is gone, but they welcome the smell of the ocean, the shade of their trees, and the water that runs from the faucet. With the $25 she is issued, the mother buys shoes, underwear, and a new mattress. They sleep downstairs, in the same configuration as they did in their tiny room in Utah, until someone throws a bottle through the window one night. 
At school and in their neighborhood, they are shunned and made to feel ashamed for being Japanese. When money runs out, the mother goes to work cleaning houses and taking in laundry. Slowly, she repairs the house and buys new furnishings, including beds for each of them. In December, they receive a telegram that their father will return. They meet him at the train station, but he is nearly unrecognizable: thin, silent, aged, injured, and demoralized. He never returns to work and spends his days at home, sleeping poorly, puttering around, and reading while his wife continues to work hard outside the home. He is a broken man. In the spring, the children unsuccessfully search the neighborhood for their mother’s rosebush.
As the story concludes, the father offers a rambling confession—none of which is true—in which he lists outlandish crimes and assumes the persona of every Japanese person in their community. He begs for punishment and apologizes. He pleads for freedom and mercy."
Lightening,"The Lightning Thief follows the story of young Percy Jackson, a troubled 12-year-old boy with a secret unknown even to himself. Diagnosed with dyslexia and ADHD, while being raised primarily by his mother, his life so far has not always been easy. Percy is repeatedly kicked out of school due to unexplainable events that aren’t really his fault. While on a sixth-grade field trip to a museum, Percy faces his strangest event yet. After an argument with a school bully, his math teacher, Mrs. Dodds, draws Percy aside to punish him. Mrs. Dodds suddenly transforms into a monster and attacks him. His favorite teacher, Mr. Brunner, rescues Percy by throwing him a ballpoint pen that changes into a sword. 
Although Percy defeats Mrs. Dodds, when he reunites with his other classmates, no one remembers her. In response, Percy acts out and is expelled from school. Percy overhears a conversation between Mr. Brunner and his friend Grover regarding Percy’s impending future, so he seeks answers from Grover on the bus ride home. After the bus breaks down, Percy and Grover notice three old women across the street knitting. One of the women cuts a string, which Percy and Grover discuss as signifying death. 
At home, Percy escapes his dreadful stepfather, whom he calls Smelly Gabe, by joining his mother, Sally, on a trip to their favorite beach where she originally met his birth father. Forceful winds and an unexpected visit from Grover lead Percy to reveal to his mother the incident that happened with Mrs. Dodds. After Percy finishes his story, Sally instructs Grover and Percy to get into the car where Percy notices Grover has hooves for feet and learns his friend is a satyr. Sally insists that Percy must go to a special camp for his safety. A monster chases after their car as they head in that direction, attacking Percy’s mother, which causes her to disappear into a golden light. Enraged, and fearing his mother’s death, Percy defeats the monster and obtains one of its horns as a souvenir. 
Percy arrives at Camp Half-Blood and meets Mr. D, the god of wine, and Chiron, a centaur, formerly known as Mr. Brunner, Percy’s Latin teacher. Chiron and Grover explain to Percy that he is a half-blood, or a demi-god, meaning that he is half mortal and half god. Since his godly parent is unknown, Percy is assigned the cabin dedicated to Hermes. At camp, Percy meets Annabeth, the daughter of Athena; his cabin counselor Luke, the son of Hermes; and Clarisse, the daughter of Ares. An altercation with Clarisse allows Percy to discover his father is Poseidon, one of the “Big Three” gods. This revelation is cut short when a hellhound attacks Percy from the Fields of Punishment. Chiron protects everyone at the camp by sending Percy off on a special quest to save the world.  
Percy’s Oracle reveals that Zeus has accused Poseidon of stealing his lightning bolt and requires Poseidon’s son to return it before the summer solstice. Chiron believes Hades actually stole the bolt to start a war between the gods. Percy chooses Grover and Annabeth to accompany him on his quest and together they head west to the entrance of the Underworld to confront Hades on the missing bolt. Along the way, the three will face several monsters before making it to Hades’ house. 
On one part of their journey, Percy and his friends fight the Furies, which causes the bus they are on to explode. After escaping into nearby woods, they come across a shop filled with many life-size statues. They meet Aunty Em, who Annabeth later identifies as Medusa. Percy defeats Medusa and sends her head to Olympus to show that he’s not a pawn in the gods’ game. Annabeth, Percy, and Grover take a train to Denver but stop at an Arch during a layover where Percy encounters the monsters Echidna and Chimera. He jumps off the Arch into the river to avoid dying and is met by a spirit who tells him to go to Santa Monica before going to the Underworld. 
In Denver, Percy, Annabeth, and Grover meet Ares, the god of war, who requests their help in retrieving his shield in exchange for information on Percy’s mother. Despite facing a trap placed by Hephaestus, Aphrodite’s husband, the three successfully grab the shield and return it to Ares who tells Percy that his mother is still alive. Ares gives the trio a backpack of supplies and safe transportation to Nevada.  
Percy and his friends continue west but lose track of time in a magical casino in Las Vegas, which leaves them only one more day to find and return the master bolt. Percy, Annabeth, and Grover arrive in Santa Monica where Percy receives three pearls from the same spirit who visited him in the river. The three search for directions to the Underworld and encounter a monster named Crusty. Percy defeats this monster and finds the address to an entrance to the Underworld. 
In the Underworld, Percy barters with Charon, a security officer, to let them in and tries to distract Cerberus, a three-headed security Rottweiler, but Annabeth is able to successfully command him. While on their way to Hades’ house, Grover’s flying shoes, on loan from Luke, pull him toward a pit Percy has dreamed uneasily about. Luckily, the shoes fall off before Grover reaches the pit. Finally, at the house, Hades accuses Percy of stealing his Helm of Darkness as well as the master bolt that surprisingly appears in the backpack Percy received from Ares. Hades reveals Percy’s mother to him in a golden light and says she will be returned once his helm is retrieved. Percy denies the allegations but after Hades threatens to kill his mother and unleash the dead back into the world, he agrees to find and return the helm. 
Percy, Grover, and Annabeth escape the Underworld and arrive in Santa Monica with the help of the magical pearls. They realize they have been manipulated by Ares and Percy confronts him about stealing the bolt and the helm. The two engage in battle. Percy defeats Ares after stabbing him in the heel. Rather than continue fighting, Ares accepts defeat but points out that Percy has made a new enemy. The Furies appear and return the Helm of Darkness to Hades while Percy, Annabeth, and Grover head to Olympus to return the bolt to Zeus.
 
Percy returns the bolt to Zeus on Mount Olympus and meets his father, Poseidon. Percy informs them of his quest and shares his concerns about the mysterious pit, but Zeus dismisses the conversation. He rewards Percy by sparing his life. Before returning home, Percy has a brief conversation with Poseidon about his mother who is safely back home. Percy learns that he has a decision to make regarding a package Poseidon has sent back to him. At home, Percy shares the details of his quest with his mother and discovers that the package with Medusa’s head has been returned to him. Before leaving for camp, he encourages his mother to use it on Smelly Gabe. 
Percy returns to Camp Half-Blood for the rest of the summer. While there, he learns his mother used Medusa to turn Smelly Gabe into a statue as she no longer needs to put up with him to keep Percy safe. She sells the statue and uses some of the money to enroll Percy in a new private school for the fall. Before the end of the summer, Percy learns that Luke was really the one responsible for stealing the master bolt and the Helm of Darkness in order to serve Kronos, a Titan and the father of Zeus. After Chiron tells Percy justice will be restored when the time is right, Percy makes plans to confront Luke the following summer."
Sunlight,"The Sun Also Rises opens with the narrator, Jake Barnes, delivering a brief biographical sketch of his friend, Robert Cohn. Jake is a veteran of World War I who now works as a journalist in Paris. Cohn is also an American expatriate, although not a war veteran. He is a rich Jewish writer who lives in Paris with his forceful and controlling girlfriend, Frances Clyne. Cohn has become restless of late, and he comes to Jake’s office one afternoon to try to convince Jake to go with him to South America. Jake refuses, and he takes pains to get rid of Cohn. That night at a dance club, Jake runs into Lady Brett Ashley, a divorced socialite and the love of Jake’s life. Brett is a free-spirited and independent woman, but she can be very selfish at times. She and Jake met in England during World War I, when Brett treated Jake for a war wound. During Jake and Brett’s conversation, it is subtly implied that Jake’s injury rendered him impotent. Although Brett loves Jake, she hints that she is unwilling to give up sex, and that for this reason she will not commit to a relationship with him.
The next morning, Jake and Cohn have lunch. Cohn is quite taken with Brett, and he gets angry when Jake tells him that Brett plans to marry Mike Campbell, a heavy-drinking Scottish war veteran. That afternoon, Brett stands Jake up. That night, however, she arrives unexpectedly at his apartment with Count Mippipopolous, a rich Greek expatriate. After sending the count out for champagne, Brett tells Jake that she is leaving for San Sebastian, in Spain, saying it will be easier on both of them to be apart.
Several weeks later, while Brett and Cohn are both traveling outside of Paris, one of Jake’s friends, a fellow American war veteran named Bill Gorton, arrives in Paris. Bill and Jake make plans to leave for Spain to do some fishing and later attend the fiesta at Pamplona. Jake makes plans to meet Cohn on the way to Pamplona. Jake runs into Brett, who has returned from San Sebastian; with her is Mike, her fiancé. They ask if they may join Jake in Spain, and he politely responds that they may. When Mike leaves for a moment, Brett reveals to Jake that she and Cohn were in San Sebastian together.
Bill and Jake take a train from Paris to Bayonne, in the south of France, where they meet Cohn. The three men travel together into Spain, to Pamplona. They plan on meeting Brett and Mike that night, but the couple does not show up. Bill and Jake decide to leave for a small town called Burguete to fish, but Cohn chooses to stay and wait for Brett. Bill and Jake travel to the Spanish countryside and check into a small, rural inn. They spend five pleasant days fishing, drinking, and playing cards. Eventually, Jake receives a letter from Mike. He writes that he and Brett will be arriving in Pamplona shortly. Jake and Bill leave on a bus that afternoon to meet the couple. After arriving in Pamplona, Jake and Bill check into a hotel owned by Montoya, a Spanish bullfighting expert who likes Jake for his earnest interest in the sport. Jake and Bill meet up with Brett, Mike, and Cohn, and the whole group goes to watch the bulls being unloaded in preparation for the bullfights during the fiesta. Mike mocks Cohn harshly for following Brett around when he is not wanted.
After a few more days of preparation, the fiesta begins. The city is consumed with dancing, drinking, and general debauchery. The highlight of the first day is the first bullfight, at which Pedro Romero, a nineteen-year-old prodigy, distinguishes himself above all the other bullfighters. Despite its violence, Brett cannot take her eyes off the bullfight, or Romero. A few days later, Jake and his friends are at the hotel dining room, and Brett notices Romero at a nearby table. She persuades Jake to introduce her to him. Mike again verbally abuses Cohn, and they almost come to blows before Jake defuses the situation. Later that night, Brett asks Jake to help her find Romero, with whom she says she has fallen in love. Jake agrees to help, and Brett and Romero spend the night together.
Jake then meets up with Mike and Bill, who are both extremely drunk. Cohn soon arrives, demanding to know where Brett is. After an exchange of insults, Cohn attacks Mike and Jake, knocking them both out. When Jake returns to the hotel, he finds Cohn lying face down on his bed and crying. Cohn begs Jake’s forgiveness, and Jake reluctantly grants it. The next day, Jake learns from Bill and Mike that the night before Cohn also beat up Romero when he discovered the bullfighter with Brett; Cohn later begged Romero to shake hands with him, but Romero refused.
At the bullfight that afternoon, Romero fights brilliantly, dazzling the crowd by killing a bull that had gored a man to death in the streets. Afterward, he cuts the bull’s ear off and gives it to Brett. After this final bullfight, Romero and Brett leave for Madrid together. Cohn has left that morning, so only Bill, Mike, and Jake remain as the fiesta draws to a close.
The next day, the three remaining men rent a car and drive out of Spain to Bayonne and then go their separate ways. Jake heads back into Spain to San Sebastian, where he plans to spend several quiet days relaxing. He receives a telegram from Brett, however, asking him to come meet her in Madrid. He complies, and boards an overnight train that same day. Jake finds Brett alone in a Madrid hotel room. She has broken with Romero, fearing that she would ruin him and his career. She announces that she now wants to return to Mike. Jake books tickets for them to leave Madrid. As they ride in a taxi through the Spanish capital, Brett laments that she and Jake could have had a wonderful time together. Jake responds, “Yes, isn’t it pretty to think so?”"
Prelude,"The epic’s prelude offers a general introduction to Gilgamesh, king of Uruk, who was two-thirds god and one-third man. He built magnificent ziggurats, or temple towers, surrounded his city with high walls, and laid out its orchards and fields. He was physically beautiful, immensely strong, and very wise. Although Gilgamesh was godlike in body and mind, he began his kingship as a cruel despot. He lorded over his subjects, raping any woman who struck his fancy, whether she was the wife of one of his warriors or the daughter of a nobleman. He accomplished his building projects with forced labor, and his exhausted subjects groaned under his oppression. The gods heard his subjects’ pleas and decided to keep Gilgamesh in check by creating a wild man named Enkidu, who was as magnificent as Gilgamesh. Enkidu became Gilgamesh’s great friend, and Gilgamesh’s heart was shattered when Enkidu died of an illness inflicted by the gods. Gilgamesh then traveled to the edge of the world and learned about the days before the deluge and other secrets of the gods, and he recorded them on stone tablets.
The epic begins with Enkidu. He lives with the animals, suckling at their breasts, grazing in the meadows, and drinking at their watering places. A hunter discovers him and sends a temple prostitute into the wilderness to tame him. In that time, people considered women and sex calming forces that could domesticate wild men like Enkidu and bring them into the civilized world. When Enkidu sleeps with the woman, the animals reject him since he is no longer one of them. Now, he is part of the human world. Then the harlot teaches him everything he needs to know to be a man. Enkidu is outraged by what he hears about Gilgamesh’s excesses, so he travels to Uruk to challenge him. When he arrives, Gilgamesh is about to force his way into a bride’s wedding chamber. Enkidu steps into the doorway and blocks his passage. The two men wrestle fiercely for a long time, and Gilgamesh finally prevails. After that, they become friends and set about looking for an adventure to share. 
Gilgamesh and Enkidu decide to steal trees from a distant cedar forest forbidden to mortals. A terrifying demon named Humbaba, the devoted servant of Enlil, the god of earth, wind, and air, guards it. The two heroes make the perilous journey to the forest, and, standing side by side, fight with the monster. With assistance from Shamash the sun god, they kill him. Then they cut down the forbidden trees, fashion the tallest into an enormous gate, make the rest into a raft, and float on it back to Uruk. Upon their return, Ishtar, the goddess of love, is overcome with lust for Gilgamesh. Gilgamesh spurns her. Enraged, the goddess asks her father, Anu, the god of the sky, to send the Bull of Heaven to punish him. The bull comes down from the sky, bringing with him seven years of famine. Gilgamesh and Enkidu wrestle with the bull and kill it. The gods meet in council and agree that one of the two friends must be punished for their transgression, and they decide Enkidu is going to die. He takes ill, suffers immensely, and shares his visions of the underworld with Gilgamesh. When he finally dies, Gilgamesh is heartbroken.
Gilgamesh can’t stop grieving for Enkidu, and he can’t stop brooding about the prospect of his own death. Exchanging his kingly garments for animal skins as a way of mourning Enkidu, he sets off into the wilderness, determined to find Utnapishtim, the Mesopotamian Noah. After the flood, the gods had granted Utnapishtim eternal life, and Gilgamesh hopes that Utnapishtim can tell him how he might avoid death too. Gilgamesh’s journey takes him to the twin-peaked mountain called Mashu, where the sun sets into one side of the mountain at night and rises out of the other side in the morning. Utnapishtim lives beyond the mountain, but the two scorpion monsters that guard its entrance refuse to allow Gilgamesh into the tunnel that passes through it. Gilgamesh pleads with them, and they relent. 
After a harrowing passage through total darkness, Gilgamesh emerges into a beautiful garden by the sea. There he meets Siduri, a veiled tavern keeper, and tells her about his quest. She warns him that seeking immortality is futile and that he should be satisfied with the pleasures of this world. However, when she can’t turn him away from his purpose, she directs him to Urshanabi, the ferryman. Urshanabi takes Gilgamesh on the boat journey across the sea and through the Waters of Death to Utnapishtim. Utnapishtim tells Gilgamesh the story of the flood—how the gods met in council and decided to destroy humankind. Ea, the god of wisdom, warned Utnapishtim about the gods’ plans and told him how to fashion a gigantic boat in which his family and the seed of every living creature might escape. When the waters finally receded, the gods regretted what they’d done and agreed that they would never try to destroy humankind again. Utnapishtim was rewarded with eternal life. Men would die, but humankind would continue. 
When Gilgamesh insists that he be allowed to live forever, Utnapishtim gives him a test. If you think you can stay alive for eternity, he says, surely you can stay awake for a week. Gilgamesh tries and immediately fails. So Utnapishtim orders him to clean himself up, put on his royal garments again, and return to Uruk where he belongs. Just as Gilgamesh is departing, however, Utnapishtim’s wife convinces him to tell Gilgamesh about a miraculous plant that restores youth. Gilgamesh finds the plant and takes it with him, planning to share it with the elders of Uruk. But a snake steals the plant one night while they are camping. As the serpent slithers away, it sheds its skin and becomes young again. 
When Gilgamesh returns to Uruk, he is empty-handed but reconciled at last to his mortality. He knows that he can’t live forever but that humankind will. Now he sees that the city he had repudiated in his grief and terror is a magnificent, enduring achievement—the closest thing to immortality to which a mortal can aspire."
Above,"Matilda Cook is a fourteen-year-old girl living in Philadelphia in 1793. Matilda’s mother, Lucille, manages the coffeehouse, and they live above the shop with Grandfather, Matilda’s deceased father’s father, who fought in the war. Matilda dreams of one day owning her own shops and traveling to Paris, but for now she helps Mother in the coffeehouse, where she is often berated for being too slow or too lazy. The coffeehouse’s cook, Eliza, is a formerly enslaved Black woman whose husband died before she could buy him his freedom. Matilda and her family also have a serving girl, Polly, who was Matilda’s childhood friend. One day, Polly fails show up at the coffeehouse. Mother goes to see where Polly is and comes back with news that Polly died from a sudden fever. Matilda feels very sad and asks to see Polly’s family or go to her funeral, but Mother doesn’t want Matilda going anywhere near a house that could contain sick people.
As Matilda serves the customers in the coffeehouse, she hears them talking about a new disease spreading around the city, and some believe it is yellow fever. More and more people continue to catch the disease and die. Mother considers sending Matilda to the Ludington family’s farm, where she will be farther away from the disease, but Matilda doesn’t want to leave. However, not long after, Mother becomes ill with the fever and insists that Matilda leave her so that she will not get sick as well. Matilda and Grandfather leave Philadelphia with a farmer and his wife to go to the Ludington farm. Grandfather begins coughing on the journey and blames it on the heat. But when the wagon is stopped by several men who are monitoring who goes in and out of the local town, the men hear Grandfather’s coughing and refuse to let him pass. The farmer leaves Grandfather and Matilda behind on the road several miles outside Philadelphia.
Matilda and Grandfather rest in the shade of a tree while Matilda thinks about what to do next. She gathers water for them to drink at a stream and collects berries for them to eat. Grandfather seems weak and at times disoriented but does not show any signs of yellow fever. After trying to find food from local farmers, Matilda returns to Grandfather and collapses. She wakes up several days later in a hospital and learns that she has yellow fever, but Grandfather does not. He explains that his recent cough was caused by heart problems. While Matilda recovers, a clerk tells her that she should go live at the orphan house since she cannot find Mother, but Grandfather protests, insisting that he’ll take care of Matilda.
Once Matilda is fully recovered, she and Grandfather return to Philadelphia. They find that the city has changed very much since they departed. Many businesses have closed. Empty houses are boarded up to prevent thieves from breaking in. When Grandfather and Matilda return to their coffeehouse, they see that it has been broken into and all of their food and several possessions have been stolen. Matilda finds some food in the withered garden and cares for Grandfather. One night, two men break into the house while Matilda is sleeping on the first floor. Matilda hides, but the men soon realize she’s there. They trap her and try to make her tell them where she’s hidden her money. Woken by the noise, Grandfather comes downstairs with his rifle and shoots. One of the men attacks Grandfather, but Matilda stabs the man in the shoulder with Grandfather’s sword, which the men had planned to steal. The men leave when Matilda threatens to kill them. Grandfather, who was knocked back by the shot of the rifle and who has already been having heart troubles, dies. Matilda brings his body outside to be buried in a mass grave the next day.
On her way home from overseeing Grandfather’s burial, Matilda sees a young girl crying. She learns that the girl’s name is Nell and that Nell’s mother is dead. While trying to find someone to take in Nell, Matilda sees Eliza in the distance and follows her until she catches up. Eliza allows Matilda and Nell to stay with her and her brother Joseph’s family. Matilda becomes attached to Nell but knows she’s not ready to take care of a child, so Matilda brings Nell to the orphan house. However, after the woman at the orphan house says they can’t take in any more children, Matilda brings Nell back to Eliza’s brother’s house, secretly relieved.
Matilda begins helping Eliza with her volunteer work for the Free African Society, caring for patients with yellow fever. One day, Matilda and Eliza return home to find that Joseph’s sons and Nell have the fever. Knowing the children need to get out of the heat to survive, Matilda and Eliza bring the children to the coffeehouse, where it is cooler. The first frost soon arrives, an event that people believe will bring an end to the epidemic. The children eventually recover.
After the epidemic ends, Matilda reopens the coffeehouse with Eliza as her partner and begins spending more time with a local painter’s apprentice, Nathaniel Benson. One day, Nathaniel comes in the coffeehouse to announce that President Washington has returned to Philadelphia. Everyone rushes outside to catch a glimpse of the president. On their way back to the coffeehouse, a carriage arrives and Matilda’s mother steps out. Mother left for the Ludington farm shortly after Matilda and Grandfather did and tried to track them down when she realized they were not there, which only made her weaker. She recovered at the Ludingtons’ and returned to Philadelphia as soon as she could. With Mother needing more rest than before, Matilda continues running the coffeehouse and caring for Nell as the city moves on from the epidemic."
Sensitive,"When Mr. Henry Dashwood dies, leaving all his money to his first wife's son John Dashwood, his second wife and her three daughters are left with no permanent home and very little income. Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters (Elinor, Marianne, and Margaret) are invited to stay with their distant relations, the Middletons, at Barton Park. Elinor is sad to leave their home at Norland because she has become closely attached to Edward Ferrars, the brother-in-law of her half-brother John. However, once at Barton Park, Elinor and Marianne discover many new acquaintances, including the retired officer and bachelor Colonel Brandon, and the gallant and impetuous John Willoughby, who rescues Marianne after she twists her ankle running down the hills of Barton in the rain. Willoughby openly and unabashedly courts Marianne, and together the two flaunt their attachment to one another, until Willoughby suddenly announces that he must depart for London on business, leaving Marianne lovesick and miserable. Meanwhile, Anne and Lucy Steele, two recently discovered relations of Lady Middleton's mother, Mrs. Jennings, arrive at Barton Park as guests of the Middletons. Lucy ingratiates herself to Elinor and informs her that she (Lucy) has been secretly engaged to Mr. Ferrars for a whole year. Elinor initially assumes that Lucy is referring to Edward's younger brother, Robert, but is shocked and pained to learn that Lucy is actually referring to her own beloved Edward.
In Volume II of the novel, Elinor and Marianne travel to London with Mrs. Jennings. Colonel Brandon informs Elinor that everyone in London is talking of an engagement between Willoughby and Marianne, though Marianne has not told her family of any such attachment. Marianne is anxious to be reunited with her beloved Willoughby, but when she sees him at a party in town, he cruelly rebuffs her and then sends her a letter denying that he ever had feelings for her. Colonel Brandon tells Elinor of Willoughby's history of callousness and debauchery, and Mrs. Jennings confirms that Willoughby, having squandered his fortune, has become engaged to the wealthy heiress Miss Grey.
In Volume III, Lucy's older sister inadvertently reveals the news of Lucy's secret engagement to Edward Ferrars. Edward's mother is outraged at the information and disinherits him, promising his fortune to Robert instead. Meanwhile, the Dashwood sisters visit family friends at Cleveland on their way home from London. At Cleveland, Marianne develops a severe cold while taking long walks in the rain, and she falls deathly ill. Upon hearing of her illness, Willoughby comes to visit, attempting to explain his misconduct and seek forgiveness. Elinor pities him and ultimately shares his story with Marianne, who finally realizes that she behaved imprudently with Willoughby and could never have been happy with him anyway. Mrs. Dashwood and Colonel Brandon arrive at Cleveland and are relieved to learn that Marianne has begun to recover.
When the Dashwoods return to Barton, they learn from their manservant that Lucy Steele and Mr. Ferrars are engaged. They assume that he means Edward Ferrars, and are thus unsurprised, but Edward himself soon arrives and corrects their misconception: it was Robert, not himself, whom the money-grubbing Lucy ultimately decided to marry. Thus,x Edward is finally free to propose to his beloved Elinor, and not long after, Marianne and Colonel Brandon become engaged as well. The couples live together at Delaford and remain in close touch with their mother and younger sister at Barton Cottage."
Find,"All the Light We Cannot See traces the stories of three characters whose lives intersect during the bombing of the German-occupied French town of Saint-Malo in August 1944. Marie-Laure Leblanc grows up in Paris, where her father, Daniel Leblanc, works as a locksmith at the Museum of Natural History. As a young girl, Marie-Laure goes blind, but her father teaches her to navigate their neighborhood independently by building her a scale model of the neighborhood to learn from. In June 1940, when she is 12 years old, the threat of a German occupation of Paris grows too great to ignore. Marie-Laure and Daniel flee from Paris to Saint-Malo, where they move in with her great-uncle, Etienne, and his housekeeper, Madame Manec.
        
Unbeknownst to Marie-Laure, Daniel carries a potentially significant item with him when he leaves Paris. The Museum of Natural History owns a legendary diamond called the Sea of Flames. Under the threat of occupation, the museum directors make three copies. Three of the four stones are sent off with various staff members, including Daniel, while the final one remains at the Museum. No one knows if the stone they possess is real or a copy. Once in Saint-Malo, Daniel works to build a scale model of the town so that Marie-Laure can learn to navigate it, and he also hides the diamond in the replica he makes of Etienne’s house. In December 1940, Daniel is summoned back to Paris, and on the journey there, he is arrested. He is taken to a prison camp in Germany, where he eventually dies.
Madame Manec has organized many of the French townspeople into engaging in acts of resistance against their German occupiers. Although Etienne is initially hesitant, he and Marie-Laure eventually begin to take part. Etienne has a special contribution to make: hidden in a secret attic floor of his house is a powerful radio transmitter. Before the war, Etienne used it to broadcast recordings of his deceased brother presenting science programming for children as a way of keeping his memory alive. Now, he uses the radio transmitter to broadcast codes and messages as a way of thwarting the German war effort. This action allows him and Marie-Laure to remain hopeful, even after Madame Manec dies in 1942.
Meanwhile, a boy named Werner Pfennig grows up in an orphanage in Germany with his sister, Jutta. Werner is extremely gifted with mathematical, technological, and scientific knowledge. After he and Jutta find an abandoned radio by accident, Werner teaches himself to repair and rebuild electronics. He is also able to listen to a mysterious French program where a man explains scientific concepts in simple language.  As the Nazi party comes to power in Germany, Werner’s talents attract local attention, and when he is fourteen, he is accepted into a specialized training school. He hopes this opportunity will give him a brighter future, but Jutta fears that her brother will be corrupted by Nazi ideology. Indeed, once Werner is at school, he witnesses a lot of cruelty and brutality, including his close friend being beaten until he suffers severe brain damage.
When Werner is sixteen, his age is falsified so that he can serve on the German front lines. He spends the next two years travelling around, tracking down any civilians who use illegal radios in occupied German territory. Werner works alongside a fellow German soldier named Volkheimer. Although Werner tries to ignore the moral conflict he experiences, he is particularly horrified when one of his fellow soldiers kills a woman and young child. By spring 1944, he and his colleagues are sent to Saint-Malo, where he is astonished to discover that a man with the same voice as the one from the program he listened to as a child is broadcasting secret codes. Unsure what to do, Werner keeps this information secret but also spies on the house from which the signal is broadcasted and catches sight of Marie-Laure.
During this same time period, a Nazi official named von Rumpel has been ordered to seize and catalogue jewels from occupied German territories. He becomes obsessed with finding the legendary Sea of Flames, especially because he is suffering from cancer and believes that the diamond will grant him immortality. Between 1940 and 1944, he gradually tracks down three out of four stones, but the genuine one continues to elude him. He finally traces the stone to Daniel Leblanc’s last known residence: Saint-Malo. In August 1944, Allied forces begin bombing Saint-Malo. All three characters are affected by the bombing: Werner becomes trapped in a cellar when a building collapses on him, Marie-Laure is alone in her house, unsure what to do, and von Rumpel seizes the opportunity to go to the house to search for the diamond. When she hears a stranger enter the house, Marie-Laure hides in the attic with Etienne’s radio transmitter, taking the diamond with her. Over the course of four days, she stays hidden, broadcasting messages that Werner receives while trapped in the cellar.
Werner eventually escapes from the cellar and rushes to the house. Von Rumpel believes that Werner is also looking for the diamond, and when he threatens the young soldier, Werner shoots and kills him. Marie-Laure is then finally able to come out of hiding and Werner helps her to get to safety. As they flee the town, Marie-Laure leaves the diamond in a hidden grotto and gives the key to the grotto to Werner. They part ways, and Marie-Laure reunites with Etienne and goes to live with him in Paris. Werner is imprisoned and falls ill. A few months later, while he is delirious, he accidentally steps on a landmine and dies. Years later, in 1974, some of Werner’s possessions are sent to Volkheimer, and Volkheimer takes them to Jutta. Jutta follows these clues to eventually meet Marie-Laure, who has gone on to become a scientist and have a child. Although Marie-Laure wonders if Werner might have gone back to pick up the diamond, it seems most likely that the gemstone was left in the grotto to be washed into the sea."
Inadequate,"In 1998, Barbara Ehrenreich, a journalist and activist then in her late 50s, sets out to document the daily struggles of America’s working poor. Having trained as a biologist, she decides to do fieldwork: in three different U.S. cities, she takes minimum-wage jobs and looks for affordable places to live. She leaves her Ph.D. and most of her skills off of her applications, to ensure that she is given the lowest-level positions available to a white, native-English speaking woman. However, she will use outside cash, if necessary, to ensure that she will never be without a car, she will not have to skip meals to save money, and she will never be homeless.
Ehrenreich’s first experiences are in Key West, Florida. Her most affordable living option, cheaper than a trailer in town, is a shabby efficiency apartment thirty miles away. Although she expects to earn $7 per hour, the first job she lands, as a diner waitress, pays much less, because she will also earn tips. The job requires not only serving tables but also additional work, like cleaning and restocking. Although Ehrenreich gets along well with her coworkers, she struggles as a waitress, because of her lack of experience. Realizing that she will not be able to stay in her apartment on what she is earning, she tries takes a second waitressing job, at another diner. She quickly realizes she will be physically unable to work both jobs, quits the first job, and takes a hotel housekeeping job next door to the second diner, instead. However, when her supervisor at the second diner yells at her, Ehrenreich has had enough and walks out.
Ehrenreich’s next location is Portland, Maine. There, after much searching, she finds a small apartment she will be able to afford. She takes two jobs. The first is with a maid service that cleans the homes of affluent clients where she works on a cleaning team with several other women. The work is back-breaking, and Ehrenreich develops a skin rash of unknown origin. She sees the other women continue to work even when they are injured or feeling sick. She notices that the cleaning techniques the team is taught to use are more about making homes look cleaner than about actually cleaning them. She learns that her employer charges customers $25 per person-hour, while she will earn $6.65 an hour. Ehrenreich’s other job is at a nursing home, where she helps serve food to residents with Alzheimer’s. The interactions with the residents are pleasant, but the cleanup work after meals is overwhelming, partly because one of the automatic dishwashers is broken.
In Minneapolis, Minnesota, finally, Ehrenreich has a very hard time finding safe, sanitary housing she can afford. A charity worker suggests that she check into a shelter while saving up first month’s rent. She has two job applications accepted, but backs out of one job, at a hardware store, when her very first shift is scheduled to last eleven hours without overtime pay. The other job is in women’s clothing at Wal-Mart. The day-long orientation for new employees includes criticism of labor unions, while the pay is less than typical for the area. The store layout is constantly changing, and customers make extra work for her by leaving unbought merchandise in other departments. The job makes Ehrenreich, by her own account, callous and spiteful. Meanwhile, she has been unable to secure a long-term rental situation. Fed up, at one of the employee meetings she starts talking about the need for a union. By now, she has already decided to quit.
Reviewing her experiences in light of the data from many different studies, Ehrenreich comes to several conclusions. She finds that workers cannot support themselves on minimum wage in America unless they work multiple jobs, and only so long as there are no unexpected expenses, such as for medical care. Ehrenreich also finds that employers try to keep information about the wages they pay from becoming general knowledge among workers. Additionally, she finds that the ways in which workers are supervised, including random urine tests for drug use, encourage the workers to accept being dehumanized. Ehrenreich adds that the attitudes found in managers of low-wage employees are based on class or racial prejudice. Finally, she states that medical benefits and child care are too expensive even for middle-class workers, let alone ones on minimum wage. She notes that perhaps someday the working poor will refuse to stop accepting their situation and will demand that things change—and concludes that the country will be a better place when they do."
Clarified,"In the Puritan New England town of Salem, Massachusetts, a group of girls goes dancing in the forest with a black slave named Tituba. While dancing, they are caught by the local minister, Reverend Parris. One of the girls, Parris’s daughter Betty, falls into a coma-like state. A crowd gathers in the Parris home while rumors of witchcraft fill the town. Having sent for Reverend Hale, an expert on witchcraft, Parris questions Abigail Williams, the girls’ ringleader, about the events that took place in the forest. Abigail, who is Parris’s niece and ward, admits to doing nothing beyond “dancing.”
While Parris tries to calm the crowd that has gathered in his home, Abigail talks to some of the other girls, telling them not to admit to anything. John Proctor, a local farmer, then enters and talks to Abigail alone. Unbeknownst to anyone else in the town, while working in Proctor’s home the previous year she engaged in an affair with him, which led to her being fired by his wife, Elizabeth. Abigail still desires Proctor, but he fends her off and tells her to end her foolishness with the girls.
Betty wakes up and begins screaming. Much of the crowd rushes upstairs and gathers in her bedroom, arguing over whether she is bewitched. A separate argument between Proctor, Parris, the argumentative Giles Corey, and the wealthy Thomas Putnam soon ensues. This dispute centers on money and land deeds, and it suggests that deep fault lines run through the Salem community. As the men argue, Reverend Hale arrives and examines Betty, while Proctor departs. Hale quizzes Abigail about the girls’ activities in the forest, grows suspicious of her behavior, and demands to speak to Tituba. After Parris and Hale interrogate her for a brief time, Tituba confesses to communing with the devil, and she hysterically accuses various townsfolk of consorting with the devil. Suddenly, Abigail joins her, confessing to having seen the devil conspiring and cavorting with other townspeople. Betty joins them in naming witches, and the crowd is thrown into an uproar.
A week later, alone in their farmhouse outside of town, John and Elizabeth Proctor discuss the ongoing trials and the escalating number of townsfolk who have been accused of being witches. Elizabeth urges her husband to denounce Abigail as a fraud; he refuses, and she becomes jealous, accusing him of still harboring feelings for her. Mary Warren, their servant and one of Abigail’s circle, returns from Salem with news that Elizabeth has been accused of witchcraft but the court did not pursue the accusation. Mary is sent up to bed, and John and Elizabeth continue their argument, only to be interrupted by a visit from Reverend Hale. While they discuss matters, Giles Corey and Francis Nurse come to the Proctor home with news that their wives have been arrested. Officers of the court suddenly arrive and arrest Elizabeth. After they have taken her, Proctor browbeats Mary, insisting that she must go to Salem and expose Abigail and the other girls as frauds.
The next day, Proctor brings Mary to court and tells Judge Danforth that she will testify that the girls are lying. Danforth is suspicious of Proctor’s motives and tells Proctor, truthfully, that Elizabeth is pregnant and will be spared for a time. Proctor persists in his charge, convincing Danforth to allow Mary to testify. Mary tells the court that the girls are lying. When the girls are brought in, they turn the tables by accusing Mary of bewitching them. Furious, Proctor confesses his affair with Abigail and accuses her of being motivated by jealousy of his wife. To test Proctor’s claim, Danforth summons Elizabeth and asks her if Proctor has been unfaithful to her. Despite her natural honesty, she lies to protect Proctor’s honor, and Danforth denounces Proctor as a liar. Meanwhile, Abigail and the girls again pretend that Mary is bewitching them, and Mary breaks down and accuses Proctor of being a witch. Proctor rages against her and against the court. He is arrested, and Hale quits the proceedings.
The summer passes and autumn arrives. The witch trials have caused unrest in neighboring towns, and Danforth grows nervous. Abigail has run away, taking all of Parris’s money with her. Hale, who has lost faith in the court, begs the accused witches to confess falsely in order to save their lives, but they refuse. Danforth, however, has an idea: he asks Elizabeth to talk John into confessing, and she agrees. Conflicted, but desiring to live, John agrees to confess, and the officers of the court rejoice. But he refuses to incriminate anyone else, and when the court insists that the confession must be made public, Proctor grows angry, tears it up, and retracts his admission of guilt. Despite Hale’s desperate pleas, Proctor goes to the gallows with the others, and the witch trials reach their awful conclusion."
Advocate,"Lawyer Bryan Stevenson gives a first-person account of his decades helping marginalized Americans who have been unfairly and harshly punished by the U.S. criminal justice system, which disproportionately targets people of color and poor people. At the heart of Just Mercy is the story of Walter McMillian, a Black man who was framed for the murder of a girl named Ronda Morrison, convicted, and sent to death row. 
Stevenson alternates chapters about Walter with his personal reflections on our country’s history with racial disparity and issues around incarceration. Stevenson highlights other groups of vulnerable people who have been victimized by the criminal justice system and shares the stories of the prisoners he has helped over the years. The book also follows the growth of Stevenson’s nonprofit law project, the Alabama-based Equal Justice Initiative (EJI), through its expansion from focusing on death row prisoners to helping people sentenced to life without parole. Stevenson chronicles how EJI becomes a significant force in criminal justice reform.
In 1983 as a law student, Stevenson discovers his life’s passion when he interns with the Georgia-based Southern Prisoners Defense Committee and meets his first death row prisoner. After graduation Stevenson accepts a job with the organization to represent poor prisoners, including those in Alabama who lack any public defender. He meets Walter McMillian on Alabama’s death row. Walter owns a successful business but also transgresses racial boundaries when he has an affair with a white woman. Soon after the affair becomes public, the woman’s friend, Ralph Myers, accuses Walter of committing the unsolved murder of Ronda Morrison, which has outraged the community. Law enforcement, including a racist sheriff and the district attorney, eagerly pounces on this accusation, overlooking Walter’s alibi and a lack of evidence. Instead, they actively force Ralph to stick with his story even when he tries to recant. They coerce other false witness testimonies, and—as revealed years later—actively suppress evidence.
After Stevenson and the team at EJI unsuccessfully appeal Walter’s conviction, they launch their own investigation of the crime and uncover new evidence. They find witnesses who can prove the witnesses against Walter lied as well as financial records that indicate that one of these witnesses was paid to give false testimony. Stevenson and his team also petition for and receive all records from Walter’s trial. However, their big break comes when they receive a phone call from Ralph, who now wants to make amends. Ralph admits to lying about Walter and says he was threatened by law enforcement. Stevenson wins a hearing for Walter where he can present his new evidence: Ralph’s testimony, which is confirmed by health care workers and other inmates, as well as recordings of the law enforcement team threatening Ralph if he doesn’t frame Walter. 
While the judge refuses to grant Walter relief, Stevenson continues the appeal process through the Alabama courts. The district attorney asks outside agents to investigate the murder for which Walter was convicted, and the investigators determine that Walter had nothing to do with the crime. Six weeks later, the court invalidates Walter’s conviction. Stevenson and the State file a joint motion to dismiss the charges, and Walter is set free.
Throughout the process, Stevenson and Walter become close friends, and Stevenson helps Walter upon his release, including filing a civil suit on his behalf and offering him a place to stay. Walter works with Stevenson to share his story, giving interviews and speaking at legal conferences, and Walter is even featured in a documentary. Unfortunately, Walter is diagnosed with advancing dementia and is forced to rely on family and eventually a nursing facility for his care. He dies in 2013. Stevenson gives a eulogy at his funeral and shares all he learned from Walter, particularly that we must extend mercy to everyone, even those who have not earned it.
Interspersed with chapters chronicling Walter’s narrative are stories of Stevenson’s other clients and work. His closeness with these prisoners and their horrifying circumstances makes Stevenson more determined to help and causes him to reflect on abstract issues that nevertheless imbue the criminal justice system, like humanity and mercy. Stevenson focuses on several categories of vulnerable people who become trapped in the system, including mentally ill prisoners, disabled prisoners, and poor women who give birth to stillborn babies. 
Stevenson and his team at EJI also become increasingly focused on juvenile offenders who are sometimes tried as adults despite their young age. These offenders may be given de facto death sentences by being sentenced to life without parole and face perilous circumstances when they are housed in adult prisons. Stevenson illustrates how these prisoners retain their own humanity while being forced to live under inhumane conditions. He also discusses some of the qualities common among these types of prisoners: They are generally poor and disproportionately people of color, and most of them lack adequate legal counsel. The juveniles have horrific backgrounds of abuse and neglect.
Stevenson and his team at EJI also work to change the legal system to offer more protection to marginalized people. Several of his cases end up before the U.S. Supreme Court, and he succeeds in winning rulings that ban as unconstitutional the conviction of children to life without parole and the execution of people deemed incompetent from dementia or neurological disease. EJI works to raise public awareness of issues surrounding unfair incarceration, produces groundbreaking reports on racial issues, and sets up programs to help formerly incarcerated people adjust to life on the outside.
Stevenson also reflects on the issues that surround the criminal justice system. His time spent with prisoners awaiting their execution makes him realize how inhumane it is to prepare another human to die. After decades of work, when Stevenson fails to prevent the execution of a man who suffers from an intellectual disability, he momentarily feels unable to continue his work. However, he realizes that he cannot help but be broken by his experiences and comes to understand that it is his own brokenness that allows him to more fully understand the need for mercy and to bring compassion to others. The book ends with Stevenson’s renewed commitment to helping others."
Residue,"An unnamed fifteen-year-old diarist, whom the novel's title refers to as Alice, starts a diary. With a sensitive, observant style, she records her adolescent woes: she worries about what her crush Roger thinks of her; she loathes her weight gain; she fears her budding sexuality; she is uncomfortable at school; she has difficulty relating to her parents. Alice's father, a college professor, accepts a teaching position at a different college and the family will move at the start of the new year, which cheers Alice up.
The move is difficult. While the rest of her family adjusts to the new town, Alice feels like an outcast at school. Soon she meets Beth, a Jewish neighbor, and the two become fast friends. Beth leaves for summer camp and Alice goes to live with her grandparents. She is bored, but reunites with an old friend, Jill, who invites Alice to a party. At the party, Alice unwittingly drops LSD and experiences a fantastic drug trip. Though curious, she vows not to do drugs again.
Alice happily experiments with more drugs and loses her virginity while on acid. Roger and his parents show up unexpectedly to visit her grandfather, who has had a small heart attack. Alice is enthralled with Roger but feels guilty about her drug use and loss of virginity. She doesn't know to whom she can talk about drugs. She is worried that she may be pregnant. Alice goes home and her family accepts her warmly. Unable to sleep, she receives powerful tranquilizers from her doctor. Beth returns from camp, but Alice finds that Beth has changed. In a boutique, Alice meets Chris, a hip girl. Alice's parents worry about Alice's ""hippie"" appearance.
Alice and Chris are both dissatisfied with the establishment and their own families. Alice gets a job working with Chris, and the two become best friends. At school, they use drugs and are popular. Chris's friend Richie, a college boy, turns Alice on to marijuana. To make more money for drugs, she and Chris sell drugs and do whatever they can to help Richie and Ted (Chris's boyfriend and Richie's roommate). Alice and Chris discover Richie and Ted having sex with each other and flee to San Francisco. Alice turns Richie in to the police and vows to stay clean with Chris. They move into a cramped apartment. Chris secures a job in a boutique with a glamorous older woman, Sheila, and Alice gets one with a custom jeweler. Sheila invites the girls to a party at her house.
At Sheila's swanky party, the girls use drugs again. They continue to party with Sheila until one night, when trying heroin, Alice realizes that Sheila and her boyfriend have been raping and brutalizing them. The girls kick their drug lifestyle. They find a new apartment in Berkeley and open a jewelry shop there, which turns into a hangout for the neighborhood kids. Alice misses her family. She returns home for Christmas, and the holiday spirit and family camaraderie revive her. She begins school and resists drug advances from old friends, though some are aggressive. Chris smokes marijuana with her, and Alice goes back on drugs. The police raid Chris's house while she and Alice use drugs. The girls are put on probation, and Alice will be sent to a psychiatrist.
Alice continues to do drugs without her family's knowledge. She hitchhikes to Denver (recording her diary entries on scraps of paper without dates). She travels to Oregon with other drug users but soon loses them. A janitor directs her to a mission similar to the Salvation Army. Alice is cleaned up and meets a young sufferer of lifelong sexual abuse, Doris, who lets her stay at her apartment. They get sick from malnourishment and hitchhike to Southern California, where Alice takes more drugs, even prostituting herself for them. Alice talks with a priest about teen runaways, and he calls her parents. They want her to come home. In the city, Alice meets several other runaways and talks to them about why they left home. She imagines she may go into child guidance or psychology some day to help out others, and she vows to quit drugs.
Alice comes home and is excited to renew her life with her family. Alice loses consciousness and drifts off into a reverie that she thinks is either a flashback (caused by LSD residue in the spinal cavity) or a schizophrenic episode. Otherwise, Alice is happy with her family and with herself, except for her social isolation: she can't hang out with drug users, and ""straight"" kids don't want her around. Alice's grandfather dies in a coma from a stroke. She agonizes over the thought of worms and maggots eating his dead body underground. Her relationship with her father matures. Someone plants a joint in Alice's purse, and she leaves school to go to his office. He consoles her, and gets her permission to study at the university library.
Alice meets a freshman at the university library, Joel; his father is dead, his mother is a factory worker, and he works as a janitor to pay for school. He and Alice get to know each other better, as does her family. She fantasizes about marrying him. Pressure to use drugs at school intensifies, as the kids harass Alice and her family. Alice's grandmother dies. After the funeral, Joel has a long talk with her about death that makes her feel better, and they kiss. She opens up to Joel about some of her past, and he is kind and supportive.
Alice writes in her undated diary from a hospital. She is unsure how she has ended up here and can only think of the worms she thinks are eating her alive. She has chewed her fingers to the bone, and clawed up her face and body. Her father says that someone dosed with LSD the chocolate-covered peanuts Alice was eating while she was baby-sitting. Alice finds out she is being sent to an insane asylum. Her father tells her that when her case was brought before a juvenile court and that Jan and another girl testified that Alice had still been on drugs and was selling them. Alice registers at the State Mental Hospital. She is frightened by the ugly building and by the inmates. She meets a little thirteen-year-old girl, Babbie, a former prostitute and drug user with a history of sexual abuse.
Life in the asylum drains Alice. A visit from her parents brings a warm letter from Joel. Her father reports that Jan has retracted her statement, and they're trying to get the other girl to do the same to free Alice. Alice returns home and is happy to be with her family. The family takes a vacation together, and when they return, Alice is invited swimming by Fawn, a ""straight"" kid. She has a fun time with Fawn's friends and hopes that they haven't heard stories about her. Joel makes a surprise visit and gives her a friendship ring, which she vows to wear her whole life. She is worried about starting school again but feels stronger with the support of her new friends and Joel. She comments that she no longer needs a diary, for she now has people in her life with whom she can communicate.
In the epilogue, we are told that Alice died three weeks later of an overdose—whether it was premeditated or accidental remains unclear—and that she was one of thousands of drug deaths that year."
Neighborhood,"In a series of vignettes, The House on Mango Street covers a year in the life of Esperanza, a Chicana (Mexican-American girl), who is about twelve years old when the novel begins. During the year, she moves with her family into a house on Mango Street. The house is a huge improvement from the family’s previous apartment, and it is the first home her parents actually own. However, the house is not what Esperanza has dreamed of, because it is run-down and small. The house is in the center of a crowded Latino neighborhood in Chicago, a city where many of the poor areas are racially segregated. Esperanza does not have any privacy, and she resolves that she will someday leave Mango Street and have a house all her own.
Esperanza matures significantly during the year, both sexually and emotionally. The novel charts her life as she makes friends, grows hips, develops her first crush, endures sexual assault, and begins to write as a way of expressing herself and as a way to escape the neighborhood. The novel also includes the stories of many of Esperanza’s neighbors, giving a full picture of the neighborhood and showing the many possible paths Esperanza may follow in the future.
After moving to the house, Esperanza quickly befriends Lucy and Rachel, two Chicana girls who live across the street. Lucy, Rachel, Esperanza, and Esperanza’s little sister, Nenny, have many adventures in the small space of their neighborhood. They buy a bike, learn exciting stories about boys from a young woman named Marin, explore a junk shop, and have intimate conversations while playing Double Dutch (jumping rope). The girls are on the brink of puberty and sometimes find themselves sexually vulnerable, such as when they walk around their neighborhood in high-heeled shoes or when Esperanza is kissed by an older man at her first job. During the first half of the year, the girls are content to live and play in their child’s world. At school, Esperanza feels ashamed about her family’s poverty and her difficult-to-pronounce name. She secretly writes poems that she shares only with older women she trusts.
Over the summer, Esperanza slips into puberty. She suddenly likes it when boys watch her dance, and she enjoys dreaming about them. Esperanza’s newfound sexual maturity, combined with the death of two of her family members, her grandfather and her Aunt Lupe, bring her closer to the world of adults. She begins to closely watch the women in her neighborhood. This second half of The House on Mango Street presents a string of stories about older women in the neighborhood, all of whom are even more stuck in their situations and, quite literally, in their houses, than Esperanza is. Meanwhile, during the beginning of the following school year, Esperanza befriends Sally, a girl her age who is more sexually mature than Lucy or Rachel. Sally, meanwhile, has her own agenda. She uses boys and men as an escape route from her abusive father. Esperanza is not completely comfortable with Sally’s sexual experience, and their friendship results in a crisis when Sally leaves Esperanza alone, and a group of boys sexually assaults Esperanza in her absence.
Esperanza’s traumatic experiences as Sally’s friend, in conjunction with her detailed observations of the older women in her neighborhood, cement her desire to escape Mango Street and to have her own house. When Esperanza finds herself emotionally ready to leave her neighborhood, however, she discovers that she will never fully be able to leave Mango Street behind, and that after she leaves she’ll have to return to help the women she has left. At the end of the year, Esperanza remains on Mango Street, but she has matured extensively. She has a stronger desire to leave and understands that writing will help her put distance between herself and her situation. Though for now writing helps her escape only emotionally, in the future it may help her to escape physically as well."
Feasibility,"Rogers (""Rodge"") and Steve Jamnik, two young men returning from service at the end of WWII, stop by the office of Professor Burris to ask if he knows anything about a man named Frazier, and the new society Frazier is trying to build. Burris remembers that Frazier was a classmate of his in graduate school, one with radical ideas and a distaste for the establishment. He sends a letter to Frazier and immediately gets a reply inviting him to visit the community. Burris agrees to take time off from his academic duties to accompany Rogers and Steve on a visit to ""Walden Two,"" Frazier's community. Rodge's girlfriend Barbara, Steve's girlfriend Mary, and Burris's colleague Castle also come.
Upon their arrival at Walden Two, they are greeted by Frazier. Over the course of their three-day visit, they are given a tour of Walden Two, a taste of what it is like to live and work there, and an earful of talk from Frazier about the planning that lies behind this utopian community. The population of Walden Two is about one thousand people, all of whom seem to be healthy and happy. They live in communal dwellings, eat in common dining spaces, raise their children in a communal nursery, and grow and build much of what they need. The standard workday lasts only four hours, or less; no one is paid wages--but nothing at Walden Two costs money.
How does Walden Two achieve this utopia? Through a science of behavior. Everything that is done at Walden Two is based on principles of behaviorism, the idea that human behavior can be controlled by manipulating contingencies of reward and, to a lesser extent, punishment. From an early age, members of Walden Two are conditioned to be productive and happy members of society. In line with its basis in science, Walden Two is an inherently experimental community. If there is evidence that a new social practice (e.g., not saying ""thank you"") will make people happier and healthier, it is immediately implemented and its consequences are carefully monitored.
Each of the visitors responds to the community differently. Castle finds it abhorrent; he spends the duration of the visit arguing with Frazier about the feasibility and desirability of a community like Walden Two. Burris, on the other hand, finds himself somewhere in the middle; he is skeptical that such a utopia could work, but he finds Frazier's arguments compelling, and he cannot discount the evidence of success in front of him. Steve and Mary are both convinced that this is the life for them; they decide to stay at Walden Two. Rodge, too, is convinced, but Barbara is not; he grudgingly leaves Walden Two with her at the end of their visit. Burris is torn, but decides to return to his academic life. However, at the train station he suddenly realizes that he would rather try life at Walden Two, for whatever it's worth, than go back to the university. He walks back to Walden Two and begins his new life there.
In the last chapter, an epilogue, he and Frazier discuss the writing and publishing of the preceding narrative as a way of spreading the word about Walden Two."
Book,"Winston Smith is a low-ranking member of the ruling Party in London, in the nation of Oceania. Everywhere Winston goes, even his own home, the Party watches him through telescreens; everywhere he looks he sees the face of the Party’s seemingly omniscient leader, a figure known only as Big Brother. The Party controls everything in Oceania, even the people’s history and language. Currently, the Party is forcing the implementation of an invented language called Newspeak, which attempts to prevent political rebellion by eliminating all words related to it. Even thinking rebellious thoughts is illegal. Such thoughtcrime is, in fact, the worst of all crimes.
As the novel opens, Winston feels frustrated by the oppression and rigid control of the Party, which prohibits free thought, sex, and any expression of individuality. Winston dislikes the party and has illegally purchased a diary in which to write his criminal thoughts. He has also become fixated on a powerful Party member named O’Brien, whom Winston believes is a secret member of the Brotherhood—the mysterious, legendary group that works to overthrow the Party.
Winston works in the Ministry of Truth, where he alters historical records to fit the needs of the Party. He notices a coworker, a beautiful dark-haired girl, staring at him, and worries that she is an informant who will turn him in for his thoughtcrime. He is troubled by the Party’s control of history: the Party claims that Oceania has always been allied with Eastasia in a war against Eurasia, but Winston seems to recall a time when this was not true. The Party also claims that Emmanuel Goldstein, the alleged leader of the Brotherhood, is the most dangerous man alive, but this does not seem plausible to Winston. Winston spends his evenings wandering through the poorest neighborhoods in London, where the proletarians, or proles, live squalid lives, relatively free of Party monitoring.
One day, Winston receives a note from the dark-haired girl that reads “I love you.” She tells him her name, Julia, and they begin a covert affair, always on the lookout for signs of Party monitoring. Eventually they rent a room above the secondhand store in the prole district where Winston bought the diary. This relationship lasts for some time. Winston is sure that they will be caught and punished sooner or later (the fatalistic Winston knows that he has been doomed since he wrote his first diary entry), while Julia is more pragmatic and optimistic. As Winston’s affair with Julia progresses, his hatred for the Party grows more and more intense. At last, he receives the message that he has been waiting for: O’Brien wants to see him.
Winston and Julia travel to O’Brien’s luxurious apartment. As a member of the powerful Inner Party (Winston belongs to the Outer Party), O’Brien leads a life of luxury that Winston can only imagine. O’Brien confirms to Winston and Julia that, like them, he hates the Party, and says that he works against it as a member of the Brotherhood. He indoctrinates Winston and Julia into the Brotherhood, and gives Winston a copy of Emmanuel Goldstein’s book, the manifesto of the Brotherhood. Winston reads the book—an amalgam of several forms of class-based twentieth-century social theory—to Julia in the room above the store. Suddenly, soldiers barge in and seize them. Mr. Charrington, the proprietor of the store, is revealed as having been a member of the Thought Police all along.
Torn away from Julia and taken to a place called the Ministry of Love, Winston finds that O’Brien, too, is a Party spy who simply pretended to be a member of the Brotherhood in order to trap Winston into committing an open act of rebellion against the Party. O’Brien spends months torturing and brainwashing Winston, who struggles to resist. At last, O’Brien sends him to the dreaded Room 101, the final destination for anyone who opposes the Party. Here, O’Brien tells Winston that he will be forced to confront his worst fear. Throughout the novel, Winston has had recurring nightmares about rats; O’Brien now straps a cage full of rats onto Winston’s head and prepares to allow the rats to eat his face. Winston snaps, pleading with O’Brien to do it to Julia, not to him.
Giving up Julia is what O’Brien wanted from Winston all along. His spirit broken, Winston is released to the outside world. He meets Julia but no longer feels anything for her. He has accepted the Party entirely and has learned to love Big Brother."
Intends,"When the novel opens, Lily Bloom sits on the roof of a building in Boston, looking out at the city and the stars, thinking about death. She’s just come from her father’s funeral. She’s reflecting on how much she resents her father for abusing her mother when a man joins her on the roof and starts angrily kicking a patio chair. The man, Ryle Kincaid, is a neurosurgeon, and the two begin to flirt and tell each other increasingly intimate “naked truths.” Ryle reveals that he lost a child patient because the child’s brother shot him accidentally. Lily tells Ryle that she gave the eulogy at her abusive father’s funeral and couldn’t think of anything nice to say, so she stood there for two minutes in purposeful silence. Lily also tells Ryle she lost her virginity to a homeless boy named Atlas. Ryle tells Lily he wants to sleep with her, but he only has one-night stands and never wants to get married or have children. Though Lily is interested in Ryle, she can’t imagine having sex without it leading to a relationship. 
Six months later, Lily uses her inheritance to buy a storefront to convert into a flower shop. A woman named Allysa offers to work for Lily, and the two become fast friends. Lily and Allysa are cleaning up the storefront when Lily falls and hurts her ankle. Allysa calls her husband Marshall and her brother for help. When Allysa’s brother arrives, Lily sees that it’s Ryle. They pretend not to know each other for Allysa’s sake, but Ryle tells Lily that he still wants to sleep with her. They decide they need to stay away from each other because they want different things. As Lily recovers from her sprained ankle for a week, she reads her teenage journals, which were written as letters addressed to Ellen DeGeneres. They tell the story of Atlas and Lily. 
As a teenager, Lily notices a boy is living in an abandoned house behind hers. She feels for Atlas and begins to leave him food, lend him her father’s clothes, and let him shower at her house. The two become closer and begin to fall in love, and Atlas becomes a confidant and protector for Lily when her father hurts her and her mother. The two watch Ellen and Finding Nemo together and tell each other to “just keep swimming” when times get tough, quoting a line from the movie. Atlas learns a family member can take him in in Boston, and though Lily dreads it, Atlas moves away to find more stability. She’s heartbroken, but he returns on her 16th birthday. He gives her a magnet that says that everything is better in Boston. They make love for the first time. Atlas promises to come for Lily when he feels that his life is good enough for her. Then Lily’s father walks in on them. He savagely beats Atlas with a baseball bat. Atlas is taken away in an ambulance. This is the last time Lily sees Atlas, and throughout her life, she wonders why Atlas never came back for her.
Back in the present, Ryle pursues Lily, and after trying to get her to have sex with him, he admits he has feelings for her. Lily insists they not have sex and try dating, since she doesn’t trust him to have a relationship with her. They quickly start falling for each other. After they have been dating for a bit, Ryle invites himself to dinner with Lily and her mom. At dinner, Lily sees Atlas working at the restaurant. She’s shocked. During a brief conversation, Atlas tells Lily he has a girlfriend but that he wishes they had run into each other a year ago. Lily doesn’t tell Ryle that she ran into Atlas and tries to avoid going back to the restaurant again. One night, when Ryle and Lily are hanging out, Ryle burns himself on a casserole dish he tries to take out of the oven without a mitt. When Lily laughs, Ryle pushes her, and she hits her head. She’s bleeding, and she feels horrified and heartbroken, immediately worrying she’s turned into her mother. He’s quickly apologetic and eventually she forgives him, saying that if anything violent happens again, she’ll leave him.
They go to dinner with Allysa and Marshall at the same restaurant where Atlas works to celebrate that Allysa and Marshall are going to have a baby. Atlas comes to the table and the waiter introduces him as the chef. Atlas notices that both Lily and Ryle are injured and intuits that Ryle hurt her. When they are alone, Atlas tells Lily to leave Ryle. When she refuses, he says she’s like her mother. Ryle sees them together, and he learns that the chef is Atlas, the boy from Lily’s past. It comes to blows and Atlas throws Ryle out of his restaurant. Lily assures Ryle that nothing is going on between her and Atlas. They enjoy a period of peace and decide to get married in Vegas. But Ryle’s jealousy continues to simmer. When Ryle discovers that Atlas has given Lily his phone number, he flies into a jealous rage and pushes Lily down the stairs. She’s badly injured. When Allysa finds out what happened, she insists Ryle tell Lily about his past. He confesses that, just like the young patient he lost the night they met, his brother died of a gunshot wound because Ryle accidentally shot him. He marks this as the origin of his rage. Lily forgives him, and they try to be together again.
Allysa and Marshall have a baby and name her after Ryle. The night Rylee is born, Lily comes home to find Ryle in a strange mood. He makes her read an article in the newspaper in which Atlas mentions a woman who is special to him and says that the name of his restaurant (Bib’s) means “Better in Boston.” Ryle has the magnet in his hand and has read all of Lily’s teenage journals. He attempts to rape Lily and headbutts her so hard she blacks out. She calls Atlas to come get her, and he takes her to the hospital, where she discovers she’s pregnant. She takes her time figuring out what she wants for her life, confused by her emotions for Atlas and by all her conflicting feelings of rage and love and hurt for Ryle. She gradually lets Ryle back into her life in a platonic way, telling him about the baby, though she’s unsure what she wants from him. 
When the baby is born, Lily and Ryle name her Emerson, after Ryle’s brother. Lily says she wants a divorce because she would never want her daughter to endure what she and her mother did. Ryle agrees, though he is heartbroken about it. They share custody of Emerson. One day, Lily runs into Atlas. He says his life is good enough for Lily now, so if she’s ever ready to fall in love again, he’s there for her. She says she’s ready, and they embrace. He says she can stop swimming."
Stimulus,"The Waves is a portrait of the intertwined lives of six friends: Bernard, Neville, Louis, Jinny, Susan, and Rhoda. The novel is divided into nine sections, each of which corresponds to a time of day, and, symbolically, to a period in the lives of the characters. Each section begins with a detailed description of the course of this symbolic day.
The first section deals with early morning, or childhood, when the six main characters are attending a day-school together. As each of the children awakens, he or she begins an internal monologue composed of thoughts, feelings, and impressions. The children interact in various ways throughout the day, and each begins to take shape as an individual in response to the stimulus provided by the world and by the presence of one another. Although their thoughts are somewhat incoherent and mostly fixated on immediate experience, their distinct personalities begin to emerge: Bernard’s loquacity and obsession with language; Neville’s desire for order and beauty; Louis’s insecurity and ambition; Jinny’s physicality; Susan’s intensity and attachment to nature; and Rhoda’s dreamlike abstraction from ordinary life.
The second section deals with adolescence, after the boys and girls have been sent off to their separate boarding schools. Bernard, Louis, and Neville differ in their reactions to the school’s authority and traditions, and they all form friendships with Percival, a popular, handsome boy who is to become a central figure in the lives of the six main characters. All three boys develop literary ambitions of some sort, though they differ markedly in their goals and expressions. The girls mostly want school to be over and done with: Jinny desires to begin her real life in society, Susan longs to return home to her father and her farm, and Rhoda wants an escape from the disruptions to her mental solitude caused by school. At the close of the section, each character sets out, whether for college, work, or otherwise, on a more solitary track.
The third section traces the characters through young adulthood. Bernard and Neville are at college together and remain close friends. They both admire Percival, but Neville has fallen in love with him. Percival has become the focus of Neville’s desire for beauty and perfection. Bernard is concerned with his own gregarious nature and thinks deeply about the way his personality is constructed out of his relationships with others. Neville shares one of his poems with Bernard, and the moment is important for both of them. Louis is working as a mid-level clerk at a shipping firm in London. He spends his lunch hour reading at a diner and people-watching, hoping to make poetry out of his observations of everyday life. Susan is at home on her farm and communes with the rhythm of natural life. She walks across the fields before dawn and senses growth all around her, though she begins to submerge her own active will. Back in London, Jinny and Rhoda attend the same party, though their experiences are very different. Jinny comes fully alive in the social setting, and she takes a great, sensual pleasure in the beauty of her surroundings and in her own personal attractiveness. Rhoda, on the other hand, feels negated by the others around her and longs to disappear.
The fourth section is set later in adulthood and centers on a dinner party, meant to honor Percival, who is leaving for a position in the colonial government in India. At the party, the six characters are united again. At first, the group is tense and uneasy in one another’s company, and they primarily notice their differences. When Percival arrives, however, these tensions are relaxed and the group comes together. Briefly, the friends are united in a moment of true communion, and their individual voices seem to blend. All too soon, however, the moment ends and the group dissolves back into its singular parts.
The fifth section takes place not long after the dinner party, when the friends have learned that Percival has been killed in India. Neville is devastated by the news, overwhelmed by a sense of death and the fragility of life. Bernard is torn between joy and sorrow: his child has just been born and his friend has just died. Bernard goes to a museum to look at paintings and finds a kind of solace, even as he is aware that his memories of Percival must inevitably fade. Rhoda finds a similar solace in music when she attends an opera soon after she learns of Percival’s death, and she finds the strength to go on for a time.
In the sixth section, the characters have entered full maturity. Louis is rising in his firm and leads a sort of double life. Although he is a respectable businessman, he is drawn to the seamier side of life and spends his time roaming around poorer neighborhoods. Louis and Rhoda have become lovers. Susan is a mother now, both deeply gratified and stifled by her chosen life. On one hand, she is fully a part of the cycle of natural life; on the other, her own life has become subordinate to the lives of her children and the ongoing life of the farm. Jinny continues her purely physical existence, taking lovers but never settling down, content to revel in her own being. Neville also moves from lover to lover, but in his case, he is trying to keep the intensity of first desire alive—it is the source of his creativity.
The seventh section deals with midlife, as the characters begin to age. Bernard has traveled to Rome, where he observes the ruins and tries to come to terms with his own sense of failure, as he has begun to doubt both his own abilities and the ability of stories to capture reality. As Susan sinks deeper into her rural and domestic life, she regrets what she has lost even as she finds a measure of contentment in what she has gained. Jinny has a moment of dread in which she sees that she is aging and her beauty is fading. She reconciles herself to the inevitable passage of time, however, and resolves to make the most of her remaining years. Neville is becoming a successful writer. He is mellowing a bit, but he continues to shift the focus of his desire from lover to lover. Louis rises ever higher in his firm but still returns to his attic room to write. Literature seems to him an idealized realm even as his eye is continually drawn to the street. Rhoda has left Louis and travels to Spain, where she too has a moment in which she comes face to face with death—here in the form of the vast sea seen from the cliffs.
In the eighth section, the friends once again gather for a dinner, though this time the meeting is shadowed by death, thanks both to their increasing age and to the absence of Percival. Although there is tension among the friends, as at the earlier meeting, this tension is resolved as they begin to share their common experiences. The characters have lived long enough to know that this meeting is one such common experience, and they have another moment of silent communion, though the moment is elegiac rather than triumphant. Rhoda and Louis have a quiet moment together as the others walk into the park, but it inevitably comes to an end.
The ninth and final section is told entirely from Bernard’s point of view. Bernard speaks to a casual acquaintance over dinner, and tries to give a “summing up” of his life. Bernard is still doubtful about the accuracy of any representation of reality through language. He tries to give a sense of the texture of his life, rather than making sweeping statements about it. Bernard discusses the others and how things have turned out for them, including the fact that Rhoda has killed herself. The most profound moment Bernard describes is one in which he himself seems to move beyond language into a direct perception of reality. In the end, however, Bernard sees his life as an attempt to use language to fight against death, and he sees how the others have, in their individual ways, been part of the same struggle. Bernard vows to keep fighting until the end."
Envisage,"In the midst of a raging war, a plane evacuating a group of schoolboys from Britain is shot down over a deserted tropical island. Two of the boys, Ralph and Piggy, discover a conch shell on the beach, and Piggy realizes it could be used as a horn to summon the other boys. Once assembled, the boys set about electing a leader and devising a way to be rescued. They choose Ralph as their leader, and Ralph appoints another boy, Jack, to be in charge of the boys who will hunt food for the entire group.
Ralph, Jack, and another boy, Simon, set off on an expedition to explore the island. When they return, Ralph declares that they must light a signal fire to attract the attention of passing ships. The boys succeed in igniting some dead wood by focusing sunlight through the lenses of Piggy’s eyeglasses. However, the boys pay more attention to playing than to monitoring the fire, and the flames quickly engulf the forest. A large swath of dead wood burns out of control, and one of the youngest boys in the group disappears, presumably having burned to death.
At first, the boys enjoy their life without grown-ups and spend much of their time splashing in the water and playing games. Ralph, however, complains that they should be maintaining the signal fire and building huts for shelter. The hunters fail in their attempt to catch a wild pig, but their leader, Jack, becomes increasingly preoccupied with the act of hunting.
When a ship passes by on the horizon one day, Ralph and Piggy notice, to their horror, that the signal fire—which had been the hunters’ responsibility to maintain—has burned out. Furious, Ralph accosts Jack, but the hunter has just returned with his first kill, and all the hunters seem gripped with a strange frenzy, reenacting the chase in a kind of wild dance. Piggy criticizes Jack, who hits Piggy across the face. Ralph blows the conch shell and reprimands the boys in a speech intended to restore order. At the meeting, it quickly becomes clear that some of the boys have started to become afraid. The littlest boys, known as “littluns,” have been troubled by nightmares from the beginning, and more and more boys now believe that there is some sort of beast or monster lurking on the island. The older boys try to convince the others at the meeting to think rationally, asking where such a monster could possibly hide during the daytime. One of the littluns suggests that it hides in the sea—a proposition that terrifies the entire group.
Not long after the meeting, some military planes engage in a battle high above the island. The boys, asleep below, do not notice the flashing lights and explosions in the clouds. A parachutist drifts to earth on the signal-fire mountain, dead. Sam and Eric, the twins responsible for watching the fire at night, are asleep and do not see the parachutist land. When the twins wake up, they see the enormous silhouette of his parachute and hear the strange flapping noises it makes. Thinking the island beast is at hand, they rush back to the camp in terror and report that the beast has attacked them.
The boys organize a hunting expedition to search for the monster. Jack and Ralph, who are increasingly at odds, travel up the mountain. They see the silhouette of the parachute from a distance and think that it looks like a huge, deformed ape. The group holds a meeting at which Jack and Ralph tell the others of the sighting. Jack says that Ralph is a coward and that he should be removed from office, but the other boys refuse to vote Ralph out of power. Jack angrily runs away down the beach, calling all the hunters to join him. Ralph rallies the remaining boys to build a new signal fire, this time on the beach rather than on the mountain. They obey, but before they have finished the task, most of them have slipped away to join Jack.
Jack declares himself the leader of the new tribe of hunters and organizes a hunt and a violent, ritual slaughter of a sow to solemnize the occasion. The hunters then decapitate the sow and place its head on a sharpened stake in the jungle as an offering to the beast. Later, encountering the bloody, fly-covered head, Simon has a terrible vision, during which it seems to him that the head is speaking. The voice, which he imagines as belonging to the Lord of the Flies, says that Simon will never escape him, for he exists within all men. Simon faints. When he wakes up, he goes to the mountain, where he sees the dead parachutist. Understanding then that the beast does not exist externally but rather within each individual boy, Simon travels to the beach to tell the others what he has seen. But the others are in the midst of a chaotic revelry—even Ralph and Piggy have joined Jack’s feast—and when they see Simon’s shadowy figure emerge from the jungle, they fall upon him and kill him with their bare hands and teeth.
The following morning, Ralph and Piggy discuss what they have done. Jack’s hunters attack them and their few followers and steal Piggy’s glasses in the process. Ralph’s group travels to Jack’s stronghold in an attempt to make Jack see reason, but Jack orders Sam and Eric tied up and fights with Ralph. In the ensuing battle, one boy, Roger, rolls a boulder down the mountain, killing Piggy and shattering the conch shell. Ralph barely manages to escape a torrent of spears.
Ralph hides for the rest of the night and the following day, while the others hunt him like an animal. Jack has the other boys ignite the forest in order to smoke Ralph out of his hiding place. Ralph stays in the forest, where he discovers and destroys the sow’s head, but eventually, he is forced out onto the beach, where he knows the other boys will soon arrive to kill him. Ralph collapses in exhaustion, but when he looks up, he sees a British naval officer standing over him. The officer’s ship noticed the fire raging in the jungle. The other boys reach the beach and stop in their tracks at the sight of the officer. Amazed at the spectacle of this group of bloodthirsty, savage children, the officer asks Ralph to explain. Ralph is overwhelmed by the knowledge that he is safe but, thinking about what has happened on the island, he begins to weep. The other boys begin to sob as well. The officer turns his back so that the boys may regain their composure."
Professions,"Lawyer Bryan Stevenson gives a first-person account of his decades helping marginalized Americans who have been unfairly and harshly punished by the U.S. criminal justice system, which disproportionately targets people of color and poor people. At the heart of Just Mercy is the story of Walter McMillian, a Black man who was framed for the murder of a girl named Ronda Morrison, convicted, and sent to death row. 
Stevenson alternates chapters about Walter with his personal reflections on our country’s history with racial disparity and issues around incarceration. Stevenson highlights other groups of vulnerable people who have been victimized by the criminal justice system and shares the stories of the prisoners he has helped over the years. The book also follows the growth of Stevenson’s nonprofit law project, the Alabama-based Equal Justice Initiative (EJI), through its expansion from focusing on death row prisoners to helping people sentenced to life without parole. Stevenson chronicles how EJI becomes a significant force in criminal justice reform.
In 1983 as a law student, Stevenson discovers his life’s passion when he interns with the Georgia-based Southern Prisoners Defense Committee and meets his first death row prisoner. After graduation Stevenson accepts a job with the organization to represent poor prisoners, including those in Alabama who lack any public defender. He meets Walter McMillian on Alabama’s death row. Walter owns a successful business but also transgresses racial boundaries when he has an affair with a white woman. Soon after the affair becomes public, the woman’s friend, Ralph Myers, accuses Walter of committing the unsolved murder of Ronda Morrison, which has outraged the community. Law enforcement, including a racist sheriff and the district attorney, eagerly pounces on this accusation, overlooking Walter’s alibi and a lack of evidence. Instead, they actively force Ralph to stick with his story even when he tries to recant. They coerce other false witness testimonies, and—as revealed years later—actively suppress evidence.
After Stevenson and the team at EJI unsuccessfully appeal Walter’s conviction, they launch their own investigation of the crime and uncover new evidence. They find witnesses who can prove the witnesses against Walter lied as well as financial records that indicate that one of these witnesses was paid to give false testimony. Stevenson and his team also petition for and receive all records from Walter’s trial. However, their big break comes when they receive a phone call from Ralph, who now wants to make amends. Ralph admits to lying about Walter and says he was threatened by law enforcement. Stevenson wins a hearing for Walter where he can present his new evidence: Ralph’s testimony, which is confirmed by health care workers and other inmates, as well as recordings of the law enforcement team threatening Ralph if he doesn’t frame Walter. 
While the judge refuses to grant Walter relief, Stevenson continues the appeal process through the Alabama courts. The district attorney asks outside agents to investigate the murder for which Walter was convicted, and the investigators determine that Walter had nothing to do with the crime. Six weeks later, the court invalidates Walter’s conviction. Stevenson and the State file a joint motion to dismiss the charges, and Walter is set free.
Throughout the process, Stevenson and Walter become close friends, and Stevenson helps Walter upon his release, including filing a civil suit on his behalf and offering him a place to stay. Walter works with Stevenson to share his story, giving interviews and speaking at legal conferences, and Walter is even featured in a documentary. Unfortunately, Walter is diagnosed with advancing dementia and is forced to rely on family and eventually a nursing facility for his care. He dies in 2013. Stevenson gives a eulogy at his funeral and shares all he learned from Walter, particularly that we must extend mercy to everyone, even those who have not earned it.
Interspersed with chapters chronicling Walter’s narrative are stories of Stevenson’s other clients and work. His closeness with these prisoners and their horrifying circumstances makes Stevenson more determined to help and causes him to reflect on abstract issues that nevertheless imbue the criminal justice system, like humanity and mercy. Stevenson focuses on several categories of vulnerable people who become trapped in the system, including mentally ill prisoners, disabled prisoners, and poor women who give birth to stillborn babies. 
Stevenson and his team at EJI also become increasingly focused on juvenile offenders who are sometimes tried as adults despite their young age. These offenders may be given de facto death sentences by being sentenced to life without parole and face perilous circumstances when they are housed in adult prisons. Stevenson illustrates how these prisoners retain their own humanity while being forced to live under inhumane conditions. He also discusses some of the qualities common among these types of prisoners: They are generally poor and disproportionately people of color, and most of them lack adequate legal counsel. The juveniles have horrific backgrounds of abuse and neglect.
Stevenson and his team at EJI also work to change the legal system to offer more protection to marginalized people. Several of his cases end up before the U.S. Supreme Court, and he succeeds in winning rulings that ban as unconstitutional the conviction of children to life without parole and the execution of people deemed incompetent from dementia or neurological disease. EJI works to raise public awareness of issues surrounding unfair incarceration, produces groundbreaking reports on racial issues, and sets up programs to help formerly incarcerated people adjust to life on the outside.
Stevenson also reflects on the issues that surround the criminal justice system. His time spent with prisoners awaiting their execution makes him realize how inhumane it is to prepare another human to die. After decades of work, when Stevenson fails to prevent the execution of a man who suffers from an intellectual disability, he momentarily feels unable to continue his work. However, he realizes that he cannot help but be broken by his experiences and comes to understand that it is his own brokenness that allows him to more fully understand the need for mercy and to bring compassion to others. The book ends with Stevenson’s renewed commitment to helping others."
Here,"There There is a collection of stories about different people who are all traveling to the Big Oakland Powwow in California. Each chapter follows a different character, describing their history and explaining why they are going to the powwow. Each of the characters is Native American, but not all of them embrace their heritage.
Tony Loneman, twenty-one years old, was born with fetal alcohol syndrome. While he grew up believing he was not intelligent, he has natural street smarts. When he looks in the mirror, Tony sees what he calls “the Drome”: the facial features associated with fetal alcohol syndrome. Tony lives with his grandmother and has been selling drugs since he was thirteen. His drug supplier, Octavio, shows him a 3-D printed gun and tells him that they are going to rob the Big Oakland Powwow at the Oakland Coliseum.
Dene Oxendene lives in Oakland and is a young, motivated artist. He obtains a grant to make a storytelling documentary in which Native people share their perspectives on living in Oakland. He inherited both his camera and his interest in moviemaking from his late uncle. Dene plans to set up a storytelling booth at the powwow.
Opal Viola Victoria Bear Shield and her sister, Jacquie Red Feather, were children when their mother took them to Alcatraz Island in 1970 as part of Native American protests. Opal mostly spent time with her mother there, while Jacquie spent time with a group of teenagers. Before leaving the island, Jacquie was raped by another teen named Harvey. She became pregnant and put the baby girl up for adoption. When Opal and Jacquie’s mother died, they entered the foster care system. Jacquie had another daughter, Jamie, who went on to have three boys: Orvil, Loother, and Lony. Jamie was a heroin addict and eventually killed herself. Since Jacquie was still battling alcohol addiction, Opal adopted Jacquie’s three grandsons. While raising the boys, Opal has taught them that they are not to engage in any Native activities. 
Orvil Red Feather, the oldest of Jacquie’s grandsons, watches footage of powwows on the internet. Feeling a connection to the dancers, he finds a set of Native regalia in Opal’s closet and practices dancing. He takes his brothers to the Big Oakland Powwow without telling Opal, hoping that he can win prize money by dancing. Opal goes to the powwow to watch, careful not to let the boys know that she is attending.
Jacquie Red Feather lives in New Mexico, where she works as an addiction counselor but still struggles with alcoholism herself. She has never actually met her grandsons. When she runs into Harvey at an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, she confronts him about their past. Harvey has just learned that he has a son in Oakland named Edwin, and Jacquie tells him that they have a daughter, the one she put up for adoption. Jacquie agrees to ride with Harvey to Oakland, even though she has a difficult time forgiving him.
Harvey’s son, Edwin Black, still lives with his mother, even though he is in his thirties. His mother helps him get a paid internship at the Indian Center where he helps organize the Big Oakland Powwow. Her boyfriend, Bill Davis, works as part of the maintenance crew for the Oakland Coliseum, where the powwow will be held.
Blue is Jacquie’s first daughter, who was put up for adoption. She was raised in Oakland but later moved to Oklahoma. Stuck in an abusive marriage, Blue escaped Oklahoma and moved back to Oakland. She has been working at the Indian Center in Oakland for a year. She and Edwin plan the Big Oakland Powwow.
Calvin Johnson lives with his sister in Oakland. He and his brother Charles work for Octavio, Tony’s supplier, selling drugs. Calvin owes Octavio money and has been avoiding him. Charles and his crime partner, Carlos, take Calvin to Octavio to sort out the issue. Octavio tells the group that they are going to rob the Big Oakland Powwow with 3-D printed guns that can get through the security checkpoint. Because Calvin works at the Indian Center, he is afraid that he will be recognized.
Thomas Frank goes to the powwow to drum and sing for the dancers. He has recently been fired from the Indian Center, but drumming gives him a sense of belonging.
On the day of the powwow, Blue and Edwin arrive early to set up the field. Dene Oxendene sets up his storytelling booth, hoping to film interviews with people and ask what the powwow experience means to them. Harvey is the powwow emcee, and Jacquie sits with him in the tent with all of the sound equipment. Edwin and Blue walk over and meet Harvey and Jacquie. Harvey embraces Edwin, recognizing that he is his son. Blue thinks that Jacquie might be her mother and is in shock (she does not realize that Harvey is her father). Jacquie sees Orvil’s name on the list of men who will be dancing.
Orvil and his brothers, Loother and Lony, ride their bikes to the powwow. Orvil puts on the regalia that he took from Opal’s closet and dances out during the Grand Entry. Up in the stands, Opal watches his performance.
Entering the Coliseum with their 3-D printed guns, Calvin, Octavio, Charles, Carlos, and Tony approach the table where Edwin and Blue are sitting. Tony is supposed to do the actual holdup while the others keep watch, but he changes his mind. In his place, Octavio approaches the table and points his gun at Edwin and Blue, demanding the money. After Octavio has the money (in the form of Visa gift cards), Charles and Carlos try to rob him. Octavio shoots at Charles but then is killed by Carlos. Calvin dies in the crossfire. Tony, seeing that many innocent people are also caught in the crossfire, shoots Carlos and then tackles Charles. Tony kills Charles but is hit many times and also dies. 
Thomas, Orvil, and Edwin are among the people caught in the crossfire. Thomas dies. Blue takes Edwin to the hospital while Opal, Harvey, and Jacquie take Orvil to the hospital.  Both boys are admitted at the emergency room, but their fate is unclear."
King,"In Book I, “The Sword and the Stone,” we are introduced to the Wart, a young boy who eventually becomes King Arthur. The Wart grows up in the castle of Sir Ector, his foster father. The Wart spends his days in the company of Kay, Sir Ector’s son and the heir to his title, amusing himself as best he can while Kay is instructed in the proper ways of knighthood. One night while lost in the forest, the Wart encounters the magician Merlyn, a befuddled but powerful old man who announces that he will be the Wart’s tutor. During the next six years, Merlyn tries to instill some of his wisdom in the Wart, teaching him about virtue and the world by turning the Wart into various animals. Finally, Kay is knighted, and the Wart becomes his squire, a kind of servant who assists and attends to his master as the knight travels in search of adventure. When the king of England, Uther Pendragon, dies, he leaves no heir, and it is proclaimed that the next rightful king will be whoever can pull out a mysterious sword that has been driven into a rock. The Wart and Kay travel to London, where a tournament is being held so that the finest knights will have the opportunity to try to remove the sword. While running an errand for Kay, the Wart removes the sword from the stone, and he is declared the next king of England.
Book II, “The Queen of Air and Darkness,” finds the young King Arthur, as the Wart is now called, trying to hold on to his power. Of the men rebelling against Arthur, his most notable enemy is King Lot of Orkney. As the war rages on in England, Lot’s sons, Gawaine, Gaheris, Gareth, and Agravaine, compete for the affections of their mother, the beautiful but cruel Morgause. By a twist of fate, Morgause is also Arthur’s half-sister, though he does not know it. Three knights from Arthur’s court arrive at Orkney, and unaware that their king is at war with Lot, they proceed to bumble around the countryside. Although Gawaine, Gaheris, and Gareth are all decent at heart, they and their brother, Agravaine, are happiest when they are listening to stories about their proud heritage and dreaming about wars and bloody revenge.
In England, Arthur begins to plan how he will rule when the battles are finally over. With Merlyn’s guidance, he decides to use his own power and that of his fellow knights to fight for people who cannot defend themselves. Arthur creates an order of knights to fight for good, called the Knights of the Round Table. Then, with the help of two French kings, Bors and Ban, Arthur defeats Lot’s army at the battle of Bedegraine. With her four children, Morgause travels to Arthur’s court, supposedly to reconcile Arthur with Lot. While at the court, she uses magic to seduce Arthur. Arthur is not aware that Morgause is his half-sister, but the incest is still a great sin, and by sleeping with her, Arthur ultimately brings about his own destruction.
Book III, “The Ill-Made Knight,” focuses on the great knight Lancelot and his moral conflicts. Lancelot is just a boy when King Arthur takes the throne, but he eventually becomes Arthur’s greatest knight and best friend. Trying to escape his growing feelings for Queen Guenever, Lancelot embarks on a series of quests that establish his reputation. In the last of these, he is tricked into sleeping with a young girl named Elaine. Guenever grows increasingly jealous of Elaine, and her jealousy eventually drives Lancelot insane. He roams England for several years as a wild man, unrecognized and ill-treated by everyone he meets. Finally, Elaine discovers Lancelot and nurses him back to health. Although Lancelot does not want to feel obligated to Elaine, he does, and on two occasions he leaves Camelot to spend time with her and their son, Galahad. Meanwhile, Arthur’s kingdom begins to unravel, and he tries to keep his knights occupied by sending them to find the Holy Grail. Only three knights, Sir Bors, Sir Percival, and Sir Galahad, are pure enough to find the holy vessel. Lancelot returns a humbled and deeply religious man. For a while, his love for God makes him stay away from Guenever, but after he rescues her from a kidnapper, they begin their affair again.
In Book IV, “The Candle in the Wind,” the destruction of Camelot becomes inevitable. Mordred, Arthur’s son by his incestuous union with Morgause, plots revenge against his father. Mordred and Agravaine trap Arthur into acknowledging the affair between Lancelot and Guenever, which forces Arthur to prosecute his queen and his best friend. Lancelot rescues Guenever from being burned at the stake, but in doing so, he kills two of Gawaine’s brothers, Gareth and Gaheris. Arthur and his armies lay siege to Lancelot’s castle. The pope sends an emissary to broker a truce, and Guenever returns to Arthur’s castle at Camelot. Arthur and Gawaine, however, still want to avenge the deaths of Gareth and Gaheris, and they continue to besiege Lancelot. While they are away, Mordred usurps the throne. Arthur rushes back to reclaim his kingdom. The night before his final stand against Mordred, Arthur reflects on all he has learned since his youth and wakes up confident that although this day will be his last, his legacy will live on."
Advocates,"Lawyer Bryan Stevenson gives a first-person account of his decades helping marginalized Americans who have been unfairly and harshly punished by the U.S. criminal justice system, which disproportionately targets people of color and poor people. At the heart of Just Mercy is the story of Walter McMillian, a Black man who was framed for the murder of a girl named Ronda Morrison, convicted, and sent to death row. 
Stevenson alternates chapters about Walter with his personal reflections on our country’s history with racial disparity and issues around incarceration. Stevenson highlights other groups of vulnerable people who have been victimized by the criminal justice system and shares the stories of the prisoners he has helped over the years. The book also follows the growth of Stevenson’s nonprofit law project, the Alabama-based Equal Justice Initiative (EJI), through its expansion from focusing on death row prisoners to helping people sentenced to life without parole. Stevenson chronicles how EJI becomes a significant force in criminal justice reform.
In 1983 as a law student, Stevenson discovers his life’s passion when he interns with the Georgia-based Southern Prisoners Defense Committee and meets his first death row prisoner. After graduation Stevenson accepts a job with the organization to represent poor prisoners, including those in Alabama who lack any public defender. He meets Walter McMillian on Alabama’s death row. Walter owns a successful business but also transgresses racial boundaries when he has an affair with a white woman. Soon after the affair becomes public, the woman’s friend, Ralph Myers, accuses Walter of committing the unsolved murder of Ronda Morrison, which has outraged the community. Law enforcement, including a racist sheriff and the district attorney, eagerly pounces on this accusation, overlooking Walter’s alibi and a lack of evidence. Instead, they actively force Ralph to stick with his story even when he tries to recant. They coerce other false witness testimonies, and—as revealed years later—actively suppress evidence.
After Stevenson and the team at EJI unsuccessfully appeal Walter’s conviction, they launch their own investigation of the crime and uncover new evidence. They find witnesses who can prove the witnesses against Walter lied as well as financial records that indicate that one of these witnesses was paid to give false testimony. Stevenson and his team also petition for and receive all records from Walter’s trial. However, their big break comes when they receive a phone call from Ralph, who now wants to make amends. Ralph admits to lying about Walter and says he was threatened by law enforcement. Stevenson wins a hearing for Walter where he can present his new evidence: Ralph’s testimony, which is confirmed by health care workers and other inmates, as well as recordings of the law enforcement team threatening Ralph if he doesn’t frame Walter. 
While the judge refuses to grant Walter relief, Stevenson continues the appeal process through the Alabama courts. The district attorney asks outside agents to investigate the murder for which Walter was convicted, and the investigators determine that Walter had nothing to do with the crime.

Meantime,"A youth named Equality 7-2521, who has found a hidden tunnel and hides in it to write, knows his solitude violates all the laws of his society. Even though he does not feel guilt for his actions, he begs the forgiveness of the ruling Council. As he spends more time alone, he realizes that solitude suits him, and he begins to crave more and more time by himself. From his tunnel, Equality 7-2521 records episodes from his childhood. As a child, Equality 7-2521 wanted more than anything to be a scholar. He believed he was cursed with a terrific curiosity, which made him prefer some things to others and to prefer some people to others. He often fought with the boys at the Home of Students, and he was reprimanded by his teachers for being too smart and too tall. He tried to conform to the standard the others set, but no matter how hard he tried, he was smarter and quicker than they were. When the Council of Vocations assigned him to be a street sweeper instead of a scholar, he was pleased because it meant he could atone for the sins he had committed.
When he was ten, Equality 7-2521 saw the public execution of the Transgressor of the Unspeakable Word, who had discovered the word “I” and was burned to death in the town square as punishment for using the word. While he was burning, the Transgressor showed no pain but locked eyes with Equality 7-2521. Equality 7-2521 comes to believe that that moment anointed him as a disciple of the same crusade as the Transgressor.
Equality 7-2521 begins to conduct experiments and shortly discovers electricity. After many weeks of work, he successfully builds a lightbulb from the materials he finds in his tunnel. He decides that he must share his invention with the world and resolves to present it to the World Council of Scholars when it convenes that year in his city.
In the meantime, Equality 7-2521 has met the Golden One, a beautiful peasant girl who is proud and haughty. He knows it is wrong to do so, but he speaks to her when he gets the chance, and they immediately fall in love. One day, she offers him some water from her hands, and he drinks it, not understanding why this act makes him think of the Palace of Mating, where he and all other mature citizens are sent once a year to have sex.
Before he can show the lightbulb to the World Council, Equality 7-2521 accidentally returns late to the Home of the Street Sweepers, where he lives. When he refuses to tell his Home Council where he has been, he is thrown into the Palace of Corrective Detention. There he is tortured, but he still refuses to tell where he has been, because he wants to keep the lightbulb a secret until he gets to show it to the World Council. He remains incarcerated until the World Council convenes, when he breaks out of the Palace of Corrective Detention and goes to the World Council, expecting to be exonerated and reconciled with his brothers.
When Equality 7-2521 arrives and tells the World Council his story, however, the World Council rejects him out of fear and anger. It threatens to kill him and to get rid of his lightbulb. He cannot abide having his lightbulb destroyed, so he grabs his invention and flees the city. He runs to the Uncharted Forest where he discovers that he is free at last to do as he pleases.
A few days later, the Golden One appears. She has followed Equality 7-2521 into the woods. They vow to live together in peace and solitude. After they have been hiking for several days in the mountains, they find an abandoned house from the Unmentionable Times. The Golden One revels in the finery she finds in the house, and Equality 7-2521 consumes the library. He discovers the meaning of the word “I,” and he vows to protect his home and from there launch a new race of men who will believe in individualism and the never-ending supremacy of the ego."

Lost,"The four Garcia sisters, Carla, Sandra, Yolanda and Sofia, enjoyed a fairly sheltered and luxurious childhood in the Dominican Republic. They often received exciting presents from FAO Schwarz in the United States. Carla remembers an iron bank representing Mary ascending to heaven, which she gave to one of the family's maids, who was later dismissed for stealing the bank. Yolanda played with her boy cousin and showed him her genitals in exchange for a Human Body doll and modeling clay. She also stole a newborn kitten from its mother and put it inside a drum that she played until she grew bored and threw the kitten outside, where it sadly hobbled away. The mother cat appeared to her in nightmares and haunted her. Sandra wanted to be an artist but her irrepressible spirit got her in trouble and she was thrown out of art class. She later came upon a naked chained insane sculptor who scared her as she fell and broke her arm. She lost her artistic vision and settled for being the sculptor's muse when she realized he had used her face in a representation of the Virgin Mary.
When their father, Carlos, got in trouble with the secret police for agitating against the military dictatorship, the family enlisted the help of a CIA operative, Vic, to get them out of the country. They fled to New York City, where they had trouble adjusting culturally and materially to the new situation. Laura, the sisters' mother, came from a wealthy and influential family in the Dominican Republic and did not like having to become a middle class nobody in the United States. She found comfort through supporting her daughters' endeavors, such as Yolanda's poetry and Sofia's defiance of her father's overprotective nature.
Dr. Fanning helped Carlos get a medical fellowship, and offered to take the family out for a celebratory dinner once they had settled in the United States. Laura wanted to make a good impression and pressured the girls to behave themselves and not ask for any special treats. After Sandra saw Mrs. Fanning kiss her father in the restroom, she insisted that Dr. Fanning buy her a flamenco doll. Carla had trouble fitting in to American school settings, and was harassed by abusive and prejudiced schoolboys. She also was nearly molested by a perverted exhibitionist in a car. Yolanda began to write in English and found a way to express her own voice, though she started off by imitating Walt Whitman. Her father criticized her insubordination, which Yolanda perceived to be intellectual independence. Sofia was sent to the Dominican Republic as a punishment for using marijuana, though she ended up getting into more trouble by spending time without a chaperone with her illegitimate cousin, Manuel.
In college, Yolanda had trouble relating to men, since she was turned off by the vocabulary men use to describe sex. Though she was attracted to a boy, Rudy, she would not sleep with him and he accused her of being frigid. She was hurt by this but later realized that he was just a jerk. She later married a man she thought she loved, John, though at a certain point they had problems communicating. Like Rudy, he did not understand her Dominican cultural heritage, and could not appreciate the Spanish language. When Yolanda stopped trusting and loving John, she could not understand the words he used, and only heard ""babble, babble."" She had a mental breakdown at her parents' house, in which she could only quote and misquote bits of things she had read and heard throughout her life. She spent time in a mental hospital until she recovered. Her sister Sandra also had a mental breakdown, in which she thought she was regressing through evolution, and would eventually cease to be human.
After Sandra is released from the hospital, Sofia planned to reconcile with her father during a birthday party. She broke tradition, in that the daughters would usually come home for their father's birthday, but she hosts the party at her house to show off her German husband and two blond children. She and her father had fought when he accused her of sleeping around during a trip to Colombia, where she met her husband, Otto. She ran away from home to assert her independence, and later married Otto. Though the party was going well, Sofia was hurt that her father did not express more affection toward her. She humiliated him with a seductive kiss in the ear as part of a party game. Yolanda returned to the Dominican Republic, possibly for good, to embrace her extended family and cultural roots. Her family thought she was crazy for driving into the countryside by herself, but she ignored them. She got lost looking for fresh guavas, and then got a flat tire. When approached by two men, she panicked and pretended not to speak any Spanish. Yolanda felt more comfortable in her English speaking American identity than with the Dominican side of her personality."
Much,"Maus: A Survivor’s Tale is the illustrated true story of Vladek Spiegelman’s experiences during World War II, as told by his son, Artie. It consists of Book One: My Father Bleeds History, and Book Two: And Here My Troubles Began / From Mauschwitz to the Catskills and Beyond.
While the story is primarily focused on Vladek’s life, there is also a frame narrative (or, a story within the story) that shows Artie and his father interacting in the present, with Artie asking questions as Vladek relays his experiences. As Vladek describes the horrors that he faced as a Jewish person in World War II, there are interspersed scenes that reveal some of the challenges that Artie faces as the son of a concentration camp survivor. For example, Vladek is obsessive about money and constantly fusses over Artie’s clothes, decisions, and refusal to eat everything on his plate (even though Artie is an adult).
Except for a brief scene that depicts Artie as a human wearing a mouse mask, all of the people in the story appear as anthropomorphic animals. Jews are depicted as mice, Germans as cats, Poles as pigs, French as frogs, and Americans as dogs.
The story begins around 1978, with Artie visiting his father Vladek in New York City. Vladek looks frail and unhealthy; he’s had two heart attacks, and the suicide of his wife Anja (Artie’s mother) a decade earlier has taken a serious toll on him. Vladek is remarried to a woman named Mala with whom he constantly argues. Artie asks Vladek to tell him stories about life during World War II so that he can create a comic book based on Vladek’s experiences. 
Vladek starts his story in 1935, when he was living in Poland. After marrying Anja Zylberberg, Vladek moves to Sosnowiec, Poland, where her wealthy family helps them get established. Vladek and Anja have a son named Richieu, and Anja’s father, a millionaire, gives Vladek money to buy a factory in Bielsko. Vladek runs the factory during the week and returns home to Sosnowiec on the weekends to visit Anja and Richieu. Anja has a breakdown due to severe postpartum depression, and Vladek stays with her in a sanitarium in Czechoslovakia until she recovers. In 1939, Vladek is drafted into the Polish army and sent to the frontlines to fight the Nazis, where he is captured and becomes a prisoner of war. Vladek is eventually released back to Poland, and he returns to Anja and Richieu in Sosnoweic.
As the war continues, the Nazis begin rounding up Jewish people in Sosnowiec and sending them away on trains. Food and resources become scarce, and Vladek begins trading goods on the black market in order to provide for his family. Several of his friends are caught trading goods and executed. The Nazis later order that everyone report to the local stadium to have their papers verified; once there, many Jews are taken away for deportation. Luckily, Vladek’s cousin is working one of the tables at the stadium, and he is able to secure Vladek’s release, as well as Anja’s and her parents’. Vladek’s sister Fela, Fela’s four children, and Vladek’s father are not as fortunate—they are never seen again.
During one of Artie’s visits to help his father and record his stories about World War II, he finds out that his father read a comic he drew years before. The comic, Prisoner on the Hell Planet: A Case History, is included in Maus. It depicts Artie as a prisoner and shows the mental and emotional pain he endured because of his mother’s suicide in 1968.
Continuing on with his story, Vladek says that after leaving the stadium, he and his family were relocated to a ghetto in Srodula. In order to keep Richieu safe, Vladek and Anja send him to live with Anja’s sister Tosha in Zawiercie. They later find out that when Tosha discovered that she and the rest of the Jews in Zawiercie were going to be shipped to Auschwitz, she poisoned Richieu, herself, and her two children in order to spare them a worse fate at the camp.
When Vladek and Anja realize that the Germans are going to send everyone in the ghetto to concentration camps, they go into hiding to avoid capture. Once the ghetto is empty, Vladek and Anja begin to walk back to Sosnowiec. Along the way, they secure passage to Hungary with some smugglers, but the smugglers betray them and hand them over to the Germans. Vladek is sent to Auschwitz, and Anja is taken to Birkenau.
Vladek tells Artie that Anja kept diaries after the war, but Vladek destroyed them in a fit of grief. Artie becomes upset and yells at his father, saying that they would have had valuable information in them. At the beginning of Book Two, while Artie is staying with friends in Vermont, he receives a call from Vladek: Mala has left him and taken some of their shared valuables. Fearing that he will be responsible for taking care of his father, Artie goes to visit him in New York.
Vladek continues his story and describes the terrible conditions in Auschwitz. While working there, he uses his knowledge of trade skills to remain valuable and avoid execution. He learns that Anja is in the secondary camp, Auschwitz Birkenau, and arranges to do some repairs there so that he can see her. After hoarding the few resources available, Vladek bribes some of the Nazi guards to have Anja relocated to his camp to work in the munitions shop.
Vladek continues his story, describing the various ways that he used his skills and resourcefulness to help himself and Anja survive at Auschwitz. As the Russian army closes in on Auschwitz, Vladek is tasked with dismantling the gas chambers. All of the prisoners are eventually evacuated and relocated to Dachau, a camp in Germany. Vladek contracts typhus from the lice at Dachau and becomes very sick. He is sent toward Switzerland by train to be traded as a prisoner of war and is eventually rescued by American soldiers. After traveling back through Germany to Poland, he is reunited with Anja.
When Artie visits his father to hear the last of the story, Vladek is very sick. Mala has returned to help, but is still frustrated by Vladek. When Artie starts to leave, Vladek, confused and tired, calls him Richieu."
Proposals,"The full title of Swift's pamphlet is ""A Modest Proposal for Preventing the Children of Poor People from Being a Burthen to their Parents, or the Country, and for Making them Beneficial to the Publick."" The tract is an ironically conceived attempt to ""find out a fair, cheap, and easy Method"" for converting the starving children of Ireland into ""sound and useful members of the Commonwealth."" Across the country poor children, predominantly Catholics, are living in squalor because their families are too poor to keep them fed and clothed.
The author argues, by hard-edged economic reasoning as well as from a self-righteous moral stance, for a way to turn this problem into its own solution. His proposal, in effect, is to fatten up these undernourished children and feed them to Ireland's rich land-owners. Children of the poor could be sold into a meat market at the age of one, he argues, thus combating overpopulation and unemployment, sparing families the expense of child-bearing while providing them with a little extra income, improving the culinary experience of the wealthy, and contributing to the overall economic well-being of the nation.
The author offers statistical support for his assertions and gives specific data about the number of children to be sold, their weight and price, and the projected consumption patterns. He suggests some recipes for preparing this delicious new meat, and he feels sure that innovative cooks will be quick to generate more. He also anticipates that the practice of selling and eating children will have positive effects on family morality: husbands will treat their wives with more respect, and parents will value their children in ways hitherto unknown. His conclusion is that the implementation of this project will do more to solve Ireland's complex social, political, and economic problems than any other measure that has been proposed."
Deep,"Scout Finch lives with her brother, Jem, and their widowed father, Atticus, in the sleepy Alabama town of Maycomb. Maycomb is suffering through the Great Depression, but Atticus is a prominent lawyer and the Finch family is reasonably well off in comparison to the rest of society. One summer, Jem and Scout befriend a boy named Dill, who has come to live in their neighborhood for the summer, and the trio acts out stories together. Eventually, Dill becomes fascinated with the spooky house on their street called the Radley Place. The house is owned by Mr. Nathan Radley, whose brother, Arthur (nicknamed Boo), has lived there for years without venturing outside.
Scout goes to school for the first time that fall and detests it. She and Jem find gifts apparently left for them in a knothole of a tree on the Radley property. Dill returns the following summer, and he, Scout, and Jem begin to act out the story of Boo Radley. Atticus puts a stop to their antics, urging the children to try to see life from another person’s perspective before making judgments. But, on Dill’s last night in Maycomb for the summer, the three sneak onto the Radley property, where Nathan Radley shoots at them. Jem loses his pants in the ensuing escape. When he returns for them, he finds them mended and hung over the fence.
The next winter, Jem and Scout find more presents in the tree, presumably left by the mysterious Boo. Nathan Radley eventually plugs the knothole with cement. Shortly thereafter, a fire breaks out in another neighbor’s house, and during the fire someone slips a blanket on Scout’s shoulders as she watches the blaze. Convinced that Boo did it, Jem tells Atticus about the mended pants and the presents.
To the consternation of Maycomb’s racist white community, Atticus agrees to defend a Black man named Tom Robinson, who has been accused of raping a white woman. Because of Atticus’s decision, Jem and Scout are subjected to abuse from other children, even when they celebrate Christmas at the family compound on Finch’s Landing. Calpurnia, the Finches’ Black cook, takes them to the local Black church, where the warm and close-knit community largely embraces the children.
Atticus’s sister, Alexandra, comes to live with the Finches the next summer. Dill, who is supposed to live with his “new father” in another town, runs away and comes to Maycomb. Tom Robinson’s trial begins, and when the accused man is placed in the local jail, a mob gathers to lynch him. Atticus faces the mob down the night before the trial. Jem and Scout, who have sneaked out of the house, soon join him. Scout recognizes one of the men, and her polite questioning about his son shames him into dispersing the mob.
At the trial itself, the children sit in the “colored balcony” with the town’s Black citizens. Atticus provides clear evidence that the accusers, Mayella Ewell and her father, Bob, are lying: in fact, Mayella propositioned Tom Robinson, was caught by her father, and then accused Tom of rape to cover her shame and guilt. Atticus provides impressive evidence that the marks on Mayella’s face are from wounds that her father inflicted; upon discovering her with Tom, he called her a whore and beat her. Yet, despite the significant evidence pointing to Tom’s innocence, the all-white jury convicts him. The innocent Tom later tries to escape from prison and is shot to death. In the aftermath of the trial, Jem’s faith in justice is badly shaken, and he lapses into despondency and doubt.
Despite the verdict, Bob Ewell feels that Atticus and the judge have made a fool out of him, and he vows revenge. He menaces Tom Robinson’s widow, tries to break into the judge’s house, and finally attacks Jem and Scout as they walk home from a Halloween party. Boo Radley intervenes, however, saving the children and stabbing Ewell fatally during the struggle. Boo carries the wounded Jem back to Atticus’s house, where the sheriff, in order to protect Boo, insists that Ewell tripped over a tree root and fell on his own knife. After sitting with Scout for a while, Boo disappears once more into the Radley house.  
Later, Scout feels as though she can finally imagine what life is like for Boo. He has become a human being to her at last. With this realization, Scout embraces her father’s advice to practice sympathy and understanding and demonstrates that her experiences with hatred and prejudice will not sully her faith in human goodness."
Cherishes,"Nine-year-old Claudia and ten-year-old Frieda MacTeer live in Lorain, Ohio, with their parents. It is the end of the Great Depression, and the girls’ parents are more concerned with making ends meet than with lavishing attention upon their daughters, but there is an undercurrent of love and stability in their home. The MacTeers take in a boarder, Henry Washington, and also a young girl named Pecola. Pecola’s father has tried to burn down his family’s house, and Claudia and Frieda feel sorry for her. Pecola loves Shirley Temple, believing that whiteness is beautiful and that she is ugly.
Pecola moves back in with her family, and her life is difficult. Her father drinks, her mother is distant, and the two of them often beat one another. Her brother, Sammy, frequently runs away. Pecola believes that if she had blue eyes, she would be loved and her life would be transformed. Meanwhile, she continually receives confirmation of her own sense of ugliness—the grocer looks right through her when she buys candy, boys make fun of her, and a light-skinned girl, Maureen, who temporarily befriends her makes fun of her too. She is wrongly blamed for killing a boy’s cat and is called a “nasty little black bitch” by his mother.
We learn that Pecola’s parents have both had difficult lives. Pauline, her mother, has a lame foot and has always felt isolated. She loses herself in movies, which reaffirm her belief that she is ugly and that romantic love is reserved for the beautiful. She encourages her husband’s violent behavior in order to reinforce her own role as a martyr. She feels most alive when she is at work, cleaning a white woman’s home. She loves this home and despises her own. Cholly, Pecola’s father, was abandoned by his parents and raised by his great aunt, who died when he was a young teenager. He was humiliated by two white men who found him having sex for the first time and made him continue while they watched. He ran away to find his father but was rebuffed by him. By the time he met Pauline, he was a wild and rootless man. He feels trapped in his marriage and has lost interest in life.
Cholly returns home one day, finds Pecola washing dishes, and rapes her. When Pecola’s mother finds her unconscious on the floor, she disbelieves Pecola’s story and beats her. Pecola goes to Soaphead Church, a sham mystic, and asks him for blue eyes. Instead of helping her, he uses her to kill a dog he dislikes.
Claudia and Frieda find out that Pecola has been impregnated by her father, and unlike the rest of the neighborhood, they want the baby to live. They sacrifice the money they have been saving for a bicycle and plant marigold seeds. They believe that if the flowers live, so will Pecola’s baby. The flowers refuse to bloom, and Pecola’s baby dies when it is born prematurely. Cholly, who rapes Pecola a second time and then runs away, dies in a workhouse. Pecola goes mad, believing that her cherished wish has been fulfilled and that she has the bluest eyes."
Cromwell,"The Common Man figures prominently both in the plot of the play and also as a narrator and commentator. Although treated in more detail in other sections, in the following plot summary, his presence is indicated only when he interacts directly with the other characters in the play.
Sir Thomas More, a scholar and statesman, objects to King Henry VIII’s plan to divorce and remarry in order to father a male heir. But More, ever the diplomat, keeps quiet about his feelings in the hopes that Henry will not bother him about the matter. At a meeting with Cardinal Wolsey, Lord Chancellor of England, More reviews the letter to Rome that requests the pope’s approval of Henry’s divorce. More points out that the pope provided a dispensation, or exemption, in order for Henry to get married in the first place, since Catherine, the woman Henry married, was the widow of Henry’s brother. More doubts that the pope will agree to overturn his first dispensation. Wolsey accuses More of being too moralistic and recommends that he be more practical.
 
After conversing with Wolsey, More runs into Thomas Cromwell, the king’s confidante. Cromwell, recently promoted to the position of cardinal’s secretary, insincerely tells More he is one of More’s greatest admirers. More also meets Signor Chapuys, the Spanish ambassador to England. Chapuys takes More’s noncommittal response to questions about his meeting with Wolsey to mean that More agrees that the divorce should not go through. Chapuys stresses Christian morals and Catholic dogma and seems most concerned that Henry does not insult Henry’s wife, Catherine, who is also the king of Spain’s aunt. Chapuys thinks he has found an ally in More.
 
Back at More’s home, More’s daughter, Margaret, has received a visit from Roper, her Lutheran boyfriend, despite the late hour. Roper asks More for Margaret’s hand, but More refuses to allow a Lutheran, in his eyes a heretic, into his family.
 
Meanwhile, Wolsey dies, leaving the position of Lord Chancellor vacant. The king was displeased with Wolsey’s failure to secure a papal dispensation to annul his marriage to Catherine, and Wolsey died in disgrace. More is appointed as Wolsey’s replacement.
 
Cromwell meets with Richard Rich, a low-level functionary whom More helped establish and to whom More gave a silver cup he was given as a bribe. (More did not realize that the cup was a bribe when he received it.) Cromwell tempts Rich with an opportunity for advancement, and the spineless Rich seems all too eager to accept the job in exchange for information he has about More. Rich and Chapuys, who has just entered, ask Cromwell what his current position is, and Cromwell announces simply that he does whatever the king wants done. He mentions that the king has planned a boat ride down the Thames to visit More. Meanwhile, More’s manservant, Matthew (played by the Common Man), has entered the room, and Cromwell, Rich, and Chapuys are eager to bribe him for information. Matthew tells them only the most well known facts about his master, but the trio pays him off anyway.
 
Back at More’s home in London’s Chelsea district, the king is set to arrive, but More is nowhere to be found. After fretting over his absence, the family eventually finds him busy at vespers (evening prayers). When the king arrives, all are on their best behavior, and More comes off as the most flattering of all. However, More does tell the king that More cannot agree to the divorce, reminding him that the king promised not to bother More about it. The king storms off, telling More he will leave him alone provided More does not speak out against the divorce. Alice, More’s wife, is angry at his behavior and thinks her husband should do as Henry wants. Rich arrives to tell More that Cromwell and Chapuys are collecting information about him. He asks for employment, but More turns him away.
 
At a local pub called the Loyal Subject, Cromwell meets Rich to conspire against More. Rich is reluctant and guilt-ridden, but he ultimately agrees to tell Cromwell about the bribe that More received and passed on to him. In exchange, Cromwell offers Rich a job.
 
Parliament passes the Act of Supremacy, which establishes the Church in England and appoints King Henry as its head. More decides that if the English bishops decide to go along with the act, he will resign as Lord Chancellor. Both Chapuys and Roper call it a remarkable “gesture,” but More, dead set against the act, thinks of it as a practical necessity. He refuses to explain himself to anyone but the king. Even his wife and daughter cannot know his reasons, because he does not want to put them in the position of having to testify against him later.
 
Cromwell meets with the Duke of Norfolk and tells him of his plan to bring More up on bribery charges. Norfolk proves that More gave the cup to Rich as soon as More realized it was a bribe, and Cromwell is forced to come up with some other way to entrap More. He tells Norfolk, however, that the king expects him to participate in the persecution of More.
 
A now impoverished More refuses to receive a letter of appreciation from the king of Spain, and he turns down the bishops’ sincere offer of charity. Cromwell calls More to his office and attempts to malign More by accusing him of sympathizing with the Holy Maid of Kent, who was executed for treason. Cromwell also accuses him of having written a book attributed to King Henry. More deconstructs both these charges, but when Cromwell reads a letter from King Henry calling More a villain, More is genuinely shaken. Meeting Norfolk outside, More insists that if he wishes to remain in the king’s favor, Norfolk should cease to be his friend, since by this point it is dangerous to know a man like More. Parliament passes another act, this time requiring subjects to swear an oath to King Henry’s supremacy in England over the Church and to the validity of his divorce and remarriage. The next time we see More, he is in jail for having refused to take the oath.
 
Cromwell, Norfolk, and the Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Cranmer, interrogate More in prison, but they cannot trick him into signing the oath or divulging his opinions on the king’s behavior. As long as More refuses to talk or sign the oath, Cromwell can keep him locked up but cannot have him executed. He removes More’s books but lets his family visit, hoping that they will be able to reason with him. Though More’s daughter, Margaret, tries to convince her father he has done all he can, More refuses to relent. Alice finally sympathizes fully with More’s predicament, and, displaying their full love toward each other, they reconcile just before the jailer (the Common Man) insists that the visit is over.
 
Cromwell gives Rich the office of attorney general for Wales in exchange for Rich’s false testimony at More’s trial. Though More never opened his mouth, Rich claims he heard More deny the king’s authority over the Church. More is sentenced to death but not before he can express his disapproval of the Supremacy Act and his disappointment with a government that would kill a man for keeping quiet. More goes to his death with dignity and composure, and the play ends with his beheading."
Danger,"In a pair of sumptuous drawingrooms, one in a Parisian mansion, the other in a chateau on a luxurious estate in the countryside surrounding Paris, two aristocrats are very bored. The Marquise de Merteuil decides, therefore, to construct a little intrigue for her own amusement and the amusement of her former lover, the Vicomte de Valmont. The Marquise is aware that a young girl of good family, Cécile Volanges, has only just left the convent so that she can be married to the Comte de Gercourt. Now, the Marquise has a bone to pick with this particular Comte, and so she suggests to the Vicomte that he seduce and debauch Cécile to create a scandal and humiliate Gercourt. Valmont accepts the Marquise's proposal somewhat coolly, since he already has his eyes on another prey, the highly religious Présidente de Tourvel, the chaste wife of a member of Parliament. But, never one to refuse a challenge, Valmont suggests that he and the Marquise enter into a slightly different bet: if he can obtain written proof that he has slept with the Présidente, the Marquise must yield herself to him.
Meanwhile, Cécile has been presented to society, and in society she meets the charming and gentle Chevalier Danceny. Danceny becomes Cécile's music teacher and slowly, with a little coaxing from the Marquise de Merteuil, the two young people fall in love. During this time, Valmont is out in the country on his aunt's estate, trying to turn the Présidente de Tourvel's head. He has very little luck in this department despite his use of every known trick in the book. Then, as coincidence would have, Cécile's mother, Madame Volanges, who corresponds regularly with the Présidente de Tourvel, happens to say some rather unflattering things about Valmont in a letter which Valmont just happens to steal and read. And thus it is that Valmont resolves to seduce the little Volanges as revenge for her mother's only too accurate trash-talk.
Cécile's ""seduction"" would be more accurately termed ""rape,"" but the girl is persuaded to enter into a bizarre student-teacher relationship with Valmont, so that for a while she is being courted by Danceny and ""loved"" nightly by Valmont. During his time as Cécile's teacher, Valmont is also able to win the heart of the Présidente de Tourvel.
However, the Marquise de Merteuil is not so easily pleased. Rather than encourage the Vicomte de Valmont to meet the conditions of their original agreement, she mocks him for having fallen in love with the Présidente de Tourvel. Valmont's pride does not withstand these attacks very well, and to avoid compromising his reputation as a good-for-nothing gigolo, he leaves the Présidente cold, with no explanation. Cécile fares no better, after a particularly rough night in Valmont's room, she miscarries his child.
Now things are really looking bad for everyone involved. The Présidente de Tourvel removes herself to a convent where she proceeds to die of grief and shame. Merteuil and Valmont are never able to reconcile their little snit and can only agree to go to war with one another. Danceny learns that Valmont seduced Cécile and challenges him to a duel; and Danceny wins the duel. Valmont hands over his correspondence with the Marquise to Danceny on his deathbed; all of society learns of her schemes and machinations. The Marquise is forced to flee town and, like a wicked old witch, is never heard from again. Full of regret for her activities with Valmont, Cécile returns to the convent from whence she came, with the intention of becoming a nun."
Renounce,"Robinson Crusoe is an Englishman from the town of York in the seventeenth century, the youngest son of a merchant of German origin. Encouraged by his father to study law, Crusoe expresses his wish to go to sea instead. His family is against Crusoe going out to sea, and his father explains that it is better to seek a modest, secure life for oneself. Initially, Robinson is committed to obeying his father, but he eventually succumbs to temptation and embarks on a ship bound for London with a friend. When a storm causes the near deaths of Crusoe and his friend, the friend is dissuaded from sea travel, but Crusoe still goes on to set himself up as merchant on a ship leaving London. This trip is financially successful, and Crusoe plans another, leaving his early profits in the care of a friendly widow. The second voyage does not prove as fortunate: the ship is seized by Moorish pirates, and Crusoe is enslaved to a potentate in the North African town of Sallee. While on a fishing expedition, he and a slave boy break free and sail down the African coast. A kindly Portuguese captain picks them up, buys the slave boy from Crusoe, and takes Crusoe to Brazil. In Brazil, Crusoe establishes himself as a plantation owner and soon becomes successful. Eager for slave labor and its economic advantages, he embarks on a slave-gathering expedition to West Africa but ends up shipwrecked off of the coast of Trinidad.
Crusoe soon learns he is the sole survivor of the expedition and seeks shelter and food for himself. He returns to the wreck’s remains twelve times to salvage guns, powder, food, and other items. Onshore, he finds goats he can graze for meat and builds himself a shelter. He erects a cross that he inscribes with the date of his arrival, September 1, 1659, and makes a notch every day in order never to lose track of time. He also keeps a journal of his household activities, noting his attempts to make candles, his lucky discovery of sprouting grain, and his construction of a cellar, among other events. In June 1660, he falls ill and hallucinates that an angel visits, warning him to repent. Drinking tobacco-steeped rum, Crusoe experiences a religious illumination and realizes that God has delivered him from his earlier sins. After recovering, Crusoe makes a survey of the area and discovers he is on an island. He finds a pleasant valley abounding in grapes, where he builds a shady retreat. Crusoe begins to feel more optimistic about being on the island, describing himself as its “king.” He trains a pet parrot, takes a goat as a pet, and develops skills in basket weaving, bread making, and pottery. He cuts down an enormous cedar tree and builds a huge canoe from its trunk, but he discovers that he cannot move it to the sea. After building a smaller boat, he rows around the island but nearly perishes when swept away by a powerful current. Reaching shore, he hears his parrot calling his name and is thankful for being saved once again. He spends several years in peace.
One day Crusoe is shocked to discover a man’s footprint on the beach. He first assumes the footprint is the devil’s, then decides it must belong to one of the cannibals said to live in the region. Terrified, he arms himself and remains on the lookout for cannibals. He also builds an underground cellar in which to herd his goats at night and devises a way to cook underground. One evening he hears gunshots, and the next day he is able to see a ship wrecked on his coast. It is empty when he arrives on the scene to investigate. Crusoe once again thanks Providence for having been saved. Soon afterward, Crusoe discovers that the shore has been strewn with human carnage, apparently the remains of a cannibal feast. He is alarmed and continues to be vigilant. Later Crusoe catches sight of thirty cannibals heading for shore with their victims. One of the victims is killed. Another one, waiting to be slaughtered, suddenly breaks free and runs toward Crusoe’s dwelling. Crusoe protects him, killing one of the pursuers and injuring the other, whom the victim finally kills. Well-armed, Crusoe defeats most of the cannibals onshore. The victim vows total submission to Crusoe in gratitude for his liberation. Crusoe names him Friday, to commemorate the day on which his life was saved, and takes him as his servant.
Finding Friday cheerful and intelligent, Crusoe teaches him some English words and some elementary Christian concepts. Friday, in turn, explains that the cannibals are divided into distinct nations and that they only eat their enemies. Friday also informs Crusoe that the cannibals saved the men from the shipwreck Crusoe witnessed earlier, and that those men, Spaniards, are living nearby. Friday expresses a longing to return to his people, and Crusoe is upset at the prospect of losing Friday. Crusoe then entertains the idea of making contact with the Spaniards, and Friday admits that he would rather die than lose Crusoe. The two build a boat to visit the cannibals’ land together. Before they have a chance to leave, they are surprised by the arrival of twenty-one cannibals in canoes. The cannibals are holding three victims, one of whom is in European dress. Friday and Crusoe kill most of the cannibals and release the European, a Spaniard. Friday is overjoyed to discover that another of the rescued victims is his father. The four men return to Crusoe’s dwelling for food and rest. Crusoe prepares to welcome them into his community permanently. He sends Friday’s father and the Spaniard out in a canoe to explore the nearby land.
Eight days later, the sight of an approaching English ship alarms Friday. Crusoe is suspicious. Friday and Crusoe watch as eleven men take three captives onshore in a boat. Nine of the men explore the land, leaving two to guard the captives. Friday and Crusoe overpower these men and release the captives, one of whom is the captain of the ship, which has been taken in a mutiny. Shouting to the remaining mutineers from different points, Friday and Crusoe confuse and tire the men by making them run from place to place. Eventually they confront the mutineers, telling them that all may escape with their lives except the ringleader. The men surrender. Crusoe and the captain pretend that the island is an imperial territory and that the governor has spared their lives in order to send them all to England to face justice. Keeping five men as hostages, Crusoe sends the other men out to seize the ship. When the ship is brought in, Crusoe nearly faints.
On December 19, 1686, Crusoe boards the ship to return to England. There, he finds his family is deceased except for two sisters. His widow friend has kept Crusoe’s money safe, and after traveling to Lisbon, Crusoe learns from the Portuguese captain that his plantations in Brazil have been highly profitable. He arranges to sell his Brazilian lands. Wary of sea travel, Crusoe attempts to return to England by land but is threatened by bad weather and wild animals in northern Spain. Finally arriving back in England, Crusoe receives word that the sale of his plantations has been completed and that he has made a considerable fortune. After donating a portion to the widow and his sisters, Crusoe is restless and considers returning to Brazil, but he is dissuaded by the thought that he would have to become Catholic. He marries, and his wife dies. Crusoe finally departs for the East Indies as a trader in 1694. He revisits his island, finding that the Spaniards are governing it well and that it has become a prosperous colony."
Considerately,"Anne’s diary begins on her thirteenth birthday, June 12, 1942, and ends shortly after her fifteenth. At the start of her diary, Anne describes fairly typical girlhood experiences, writing about her friendships with other girls, her crushes on boys, and her academic performance at school. Because anti-Semitic laws forced Jews into separate schools, Anne and her older sister, Margot, attended the Jewish Lyceum in Amsterdam.
	The Franks had moved to the Netherlands in the years leading up to World War II to escape persecution in Germany. After the Germans invaded the Netherlands in 1940, the Franks were forced into hiding. With another family, the van Daans, and an acquaintance, Mr. Dussel, they moved into a small secret annex above Otto Frank’s office where they had stockpiled food and supplies. The employees from Otto’s firm helped hide the Franks and kept them supplied with food, medicine, and information about the outside world.
	The residents of the annex pay close attention to every development of the war by listening to the radio. Some bits of news catch Anne’s attention and make their way into her diary, providing a vivid historical context for her personal thoughts. The adults make optimistic bets about when the war will end, and their mood is severely affected by Allied setbacks or German advances. Amsterdam is devastated by the war during the two years the Franks are in hiding. All of the city’s residents suffer, since food becomes scarce and robberies more frequent.
	Anne often writes about her feelings of isolation and loneliness. She has a tumultuous relationship with the adults in the annex, particularly her mother, whom she considers lacking in love and affection. She adores her father, but she is frequently scolded and criticized by Mr. and Mrs. van Daan and Mr. Dussel. Anne thinks that her sister, Margot, is smart, pretty, and agreeable, but she does not feel close to her and does not write much about her. Anne eventually develops a close friendship with Peter van Daan, the teenage boy in the annex. Mr. Frank does not approve, however, and the intensity of Anne’s infatuation begins to lessen.
	Anne matures considerably throughout the course of her diary entries, moving from detailed accounts of basic activities to deeper, more profound thoughts about humanity and her own personal nature. She finds it difficult to understand why the Jews are being singled out and persecuted. Anne also confronts her own identity. Though she considers herself to be German, her German citizenship has been revoked, and though she calls Holland her home, many of the Dutch have turned against the Jews. Anne feels a tremendous solidarity with her aggrieved people, and yet at the same time she wants to be seen as an individual rather than a member of a persecuted group.
During the two years recorded in her diary, Anne deals with confinement and deprivation, as well as the complicated and difficult issues of growing up in the brutal circumstances of the Holocaust. Her diary describes a struggle to define herself within this climate of oppression. Anne’s diary ends without comment on August 1, 1944, the end of a seemingly normal day that leaves us with the expectation of seeing another entry on the next page. However, the Frank family is betrayed to the Nazis and arrested on August 4, 1944. Anne’s diary, the observations of an imaginative, friendly, sometimes petty, and rather normal teenage girl, comes to an abrupt and silent end. 
Otto Frank is the family’s sole survivor, and he recovers Anne’s diary from Miep. He decides to fulfill Anne’s wishes by publishing the diary. Anne’s diary becomes a condemnation of the unimaginable horror of the Holocaust, and one of the few accounts that describe it from a young person’s perspective.
	Since Anne’s diary is a true personal account of a life in hiding, it is inappropriate to analyze it as a novel or other work of fiction. Parts of the diary were intended for public view, but others clearly were not. To appreciate and interpret the diary, it is necessary to consider its horrible context, World War II and the Holocaust, before any discussion of plot development or thematic content."
Criminal,"Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov, a former student, lives in a tiny garret on the top floor of a run-down apartment building in St. Petersburg. He is sickly, dressed in rags, short on money, and talks to himself, but he is also handsome, proud, and intelligent. He is contemplating committing an awful crime, but the nature of the crime is not yet clear. He goes to the apartment of an old pawnbroker, Alyona Ivanovna, to get money for a watch and to plan the crime. Afterward, he stops for a drink at a tavern, where he meets a man named Marmeladov, who, in a fit of drunkenness, has abandoned his job and proceeded on a five-day drinking binge, afraid to return home to his family. Marmeladov tells Raskolnikov about his sickly wife, Katerina Ivanovna, and his daughter, Sonya, who has been forced into prostitution to support the family. Raskolnikov walks with Marmeladov to Marmeladov’s apartment, where he meets Katerina and sees firsthand the squalid conditions in which they live.
The next day, Raskolnikov receives a letter from his mother, Pulcheria Alexandrovna, informing him that his sister, Dunya, is engaged to be married to a government official named Luzhin and that they are all moving to St. Petersburg. He goes to another tavern, where he overhears a student talking about how society would be better off if the old pawnbroker Alyona Ivanovna were dead. Later, in the streets, Raskolnikov hears that the pawnbroker will be alone in her apartment the next evening. He sleeps fitfully and wakes up the next day, finds an ax, and fashions a fake item to pawn to distract the pawnbroker. That night, he goes to her apartment and kills her. While he is rummaging through her bedroom, looking for money, her sister, Lizaveta, walks in, and Raskolnikov kills her as well. He barely escapes from the apartment without being seen, then returns to his apartment and collapses on the sofa.
Waking up the next day, Raskolnikov frantically searches his clothing for traces of blood. He receives a summons from the police, but it seems to be unrelated to the murders. At the police station, he learns that his landlady is trying to collect money that he owes her. During a conversation about the murders, Raskolnikov faints, and the police begin to suspect him. Raskolnikov returns to his room, collects the goods that he stole from the pawnbroker, and buries them under a rock in an out-of-the-way courtyard. He visits his friend Razumikhin and refuses his offer of work. Returning to his apartment, Raskolnikov falls into a fitful, nightmare-ridden sleep. After four days of fever and delirium, he wakes up to find out that his housekeeper, Nastasya, and Razumikhin have been taking care of him. He learns that Zossimov, a doctor, and Zamyotov, a young police detective, have also been visiting him. They have all noticed that Raskolnikov becomes extremely uncomfortable whenever the murders of the pawnbroker and her sister are mentioned. Luzhin, Dunya’s fiancé, also makes a visit. After a confrontation with Luzhin, Raskolnikov goes to a café, where he almost confesses to Zamyotov that he is the murderer. Afterward, he impulsively goes to the apartment of the pawnbroker. On his way back home, he discovers that Marmeladov has been run over by a carriage. Raskolnikov helps to carry him back to his apartment, where Marmeladov dies. At the apartment, he meets Sonya and gives the family twenty rubles that he received from his mother. Returning with Razumikhin to his own apartment, Raskolnikov faints when he discovers that his sister and mother are there waiting for him.
Raskolnikov becomes annoyed with Pulcheria Alexandrovna and Dunya and orders them out of the room. He also commands Dunya to break her engagement with Luzhin. Razumikhin, meanwhile, falls in love with Dunya. The next morning, Razumikhin tries to explain Raskolnikov’s character to Dunya and Pulcheria Alexandrovna, and then the three return to Raskolnikov’s apartment. There, Zossimov greets them and tells them that Raskolnikov’s condition is much improved. Raskolnikov apologizes for his behavior the night before and confesses to giving all his money to the Marmeladovs. But he soon grows angry and irritable again and demands that Dunya not marry Luzhin. Dunya tells him that she is meeting with Luzhin that evening, and that although Luzhin has requested specifically that Raskolnikov not be there, she would like him to come nevertheless. Raskolnikov agrees. At that moment, Sonya enters the room, greatly embarrassed to be in the presence of Raskolnikov’s family. She invites Raskolnikov to her father’s funeral, and he accepts. On her way back to her apartment, Sonya is followed by a strange man, who we later learn is Svidrigailov—Dunya’s lecherous former employer who is obsessively attracted to her.
Under the pretense of trying to recover a watch he pawned, Raskolnikov visits the magistrate in charge of the murder investigation, Porfiry Petrovich, a relative of Razumikhin’s. Zamyotov is at the detective’s house when Raskolnikov arrives. Raskolnikov and Porfiry have a tense conversation about the murders. Raskolnikov starts to believe that Porfiry suspects him and is trying to lead him into a trap. Afterward, Raskolnikov and Razumikhin discuss the conversation, trying to figure out if Porfiry suspects him. When Raskolnikov returns to his apartment, he learns that a man had come there looking for him. When he catches up to the man in the street, the man calls him a murderer. That night Raskolnikov dreams about the pawnbroker’s murder. When he wakes up, there is a stranger in the room.
The stranger is Svidrigailov. He explains that he would like Dunya to break her engagement with Luzhin, whom he esteems unworthy of her. He offers to give Dunya the enormous sum of ten thousand rubles. He also tells Raskolnikov that his late wife, Marfa Petrovna, left Dunya three thousand rubles in her will. Raskolnikov rejects Svidrigailov’s offer of money and, after hearing him talk about seeing the ghost of Marfa, suspects that he is insane. After Svidrigailov leaves, Raskolnikov and Razumikhin walk to a restaurant to meet Dunya, Pulcheria Alexandrovna, and Luzhin. Razumikhin tells Raskolnikov that he is certain that the police suspect Raskolnikov. Luzhin is insulted to find that Raskolnikov, contrary to his wishes, is in attendance at the meal. They discuss Svidrigailov’s arrival in the city and the money that has been offered to Dunya. Luzhin and Raskolnikov get into an argument, during the course of which Luzhin offends everyone in the room, including his fiancée and prospective mother-in-law. Dunya breaks the engagement and forces him to leave. Everyone is overjoyed at his departure. Razumikhin starts to talk about plans to go into the publishing business as a family, but Raskolnikov ruins the mood by telling them that he does not want to see them anymore. When Raskolnikov leaves the room, Razumikhin chases him down the stairs. They stop, face-to-face, and Razumikhin realizes, without a word being spoken, that Raskolnikov is guilty of the murders. He rushes back to Dunya and Pulcheria Alexandrovna to reassure them that he will help them through whatever difficulties they encounter.
Raskolnikov goes to the apartment of Sonya Marmeladov. During their conversation, he learns that Sonya was a friend of one of his victims, Lizaveta. He forces Sonya to read to him the biblical story of Lazarus, who was resurrected by Jesus. Meanwhile, Svidrigailov eavesdrops from the apartment next door.
The following morning, Raskolnikov visits Porfiry Petrovich at the police department, supposedly in order to turn in a formal request for his pawned watch. As they converse, Raskolnikov starts to feel again that Porfiry is trying to lead him into a trap. Eventually, he breaks under the pressure and accuses Porfiry of playing psychological games with him. At the height of tension between them, Nikolai, a workman who is being held under suspicion for the murders, bursts into the room and confesses to the murders. On the way to Katerina Ivanovna’s memorial dinner for Marmeladov, Raskolnikov meets the mysterious man who called him a murderer and learns that the man actually knows very little about the case.
The scene shifts to the apartment of Luzhin and his roommate, Lebezyatnikov, where Luzhin is nursing his hatred for Raskolnikov, whom he blames for the breaking of his engagement to Dunya. Although Luzhin has been invited to Marmeladov’s memorial dinner, he refuses to go. He invites Sonya to his room and gives her a ten-ruble bill. Katerina’s memorial dinner goes poorly. The widow is extremely fussy and proud, but few guests have shown up, and, except for Raskolnikov, those that have are drunk and crude. Luzhin then enters the room and accuses Sonya of stealing a one-hundred-ruble bill. Sonya denies his claim, but the bill is discovered in one of her pockets. Just as everyone is about to label Sonya a thief, however, Lebezyatnikov enters and tells the room that he saw Luzhin slip the bill into Sonya’s pocket as she was leaving his room. Raskolnikov explains that Luzhin was probably trying to embarrass him by discrediting Sonya. Luzhin leaves, and a fight breaks out between Katerina and her landlady.
After the dinner, Raskolnikov goes to Sonya’s room and confesses the murders to her. They have a long conversation about his confused motives. Sonya tries to convince him to confess to the authorities. Lebezyatnikov then enters and informs them that Katerina Ivanovna seems to have gone mad—she is parading the children in the streets, begging for money. Sonya rushes out to find them while Raskolnikov goes back to his room and talks to Dunya. He soon returns to the street and sees Katerina dancing and singing wildly. She collapses after a confrontation with a policeman and, soon after being brought back to her room, dies. Svidrigailov appears and offers to pay for the funeral and the care of the children. He reveals to Raskolnikov that he knows Raskolnikov is the murderer.
Raskolnikov wanders around in a haze after his confession to Sonya and the death of Katerina. Razumikhin confronts him in his room, asking him whether he has gone mad and telling him of the pain that he has caused his mother and sister. After their conversation, Porfiry Petrovich appears and apologizes for his treatment of Raskolnikov in the police station. Nonetheless, he does not believe Nikolai’s confession. He accuses Raskolnikov of the murders but admits that he does not have enough evidence to arrest him. Finally, he urges him to confess, telling him that he will receive a lighter sentence if he does so. Raskolnikov goes looking for Svidrigailov, eventually finding him in a café. Svidrigailov tells him that though he is still attracted to Dunya, he has gotten engaged to a sixteen-year-old girl. Svidrigailov parts from Raskolnikov and manages to bring Dunya to his room, where he threatens to rape her after she refuses to marry him. She fires several shots at him with a revolver and misses, but when he sees how strongly she dislikes him, he allows her to leave. He takes her revolver and wanders aimlessly around St. Petersburg. He gives three thousand rubles to Dunya, fifteen thousand rubles to the family of his fiancée, and then books a room in a hotel. He sleeps fitfully and dreams of a flood and a seductive five-year-old girl. In the morning, he kills himself.
Raskolnikov, who is visiting his mother, tells her that he will always love her and then returns to his room, where he tells Dunya that he is planning to confess. After she leaves, he goes to visit Sonya, who gives him a cross to wear. On the way to the police station, he stops in a marketplace and kisses the ground. He almost pulls back from confessing when he reaches the police station and learns of Svidrigailov’s suicide. The sight of Sonya, however, convinces him to go through with it, and he confesses to one of the police officials, Ilya Petrovich.
A year and a half later, Raskolnikov is in prison in Siberia, where he has been for nine months. Sonya has moved to the town outside the prison, and she visits Raskolnikov regularly and tries to ease his burden. Because of his confession, his mental confusion surrounding the murders, and testimony about his past good deeds, he has received, instead of a death sentence, a reduced sentence of eight years of hard labor in Siberia. After Raskolnikov’s arrest, his mother became delirious and died. Razumikhin and Dunya were married. For a short while, Raskolnikov remains as proud and alienated from humanity as he was before his confession, but he eventually realizes that he truly loves Sonya and expresses remorse for his crime."
Insuring,"A Raisin in the Sun portrays a few weeks in the life of the Youngers, a Black family living on the South Side of Chicago in the 1950s. When the play opens, the Youngers are about to receive an insurance check for $10,000. This money comes from the deceased Mr. Younger’s life insurance policy. Each of the adult members of the family has an idea as to what he or she would like to do with this money. The matriarch of the family, Mama, wants to buy a house to fulfill a dream she shared with her husband. Mama’s son, Walter Lee, would rather use the money to invest in a liquor store with his friends. He believes that the investment will solve the family’s financial problems forever. Walter’s wife, Ruth, agrees with Mama, however, and hopes that she and Walter can provide more space and opportunity for their son, Travis. Finally, Beneatha, Walter’s sister and Mama’s daughter, wants to use the money for her medical school tuition. She also wishes that her family members were not so interested in assimilating into the white world. Beneatha instead tries to find her identity by looking back to the past and to Africa.
As the play progresses, the Youngers clash over their competing dreams. Ruth discovers that she is pregnant but fears that if she has the child, she will put more financial pressure on her family members. When Walter says nothing to Ruth’s admission that she is considering abortion, Mama puts a down payment on a house for the whole family. She believes that a bigger, brighter dwelling will help them all. This house is in Clybourne Park, an entirely white neighborhood. When the Youngers’ future neighbors find out that the Youngers are moving in, they send Mr. Lindner, from the Clybourne Park Improvement Association, to offer the Youngers money in return for staying away. The Youngers refuse the deal, even after Walter loses the rest of the money ($6,500) to his friend Willy Harris, who persuades Walter to invest in the liquor store and then runs off with his cash.
In the meantime, Beneatha rejects her suitor, George Murchison, whom she believes to be shallow and blind to the problems of race. Subsequently, she receives a marriage proposal from her Nigerian boyfriend, Joseph Asagai, who wants Beneatha to get a medical degree and move to Africa with him (Beneatha does not make her choice before the end of the play). The Youngers eventually move out of the apartment, fulfilling the family’s long-held dream. Their future seems uncertain and slightly dangerous, but they are optimistic and determined to live a better life. They believe that they can succeed if they stick together as a family and resolve to defer their dreams no longer."
Between,"Between the World and Me is a letter written in three parts. Coates writes directly to his son Samori. Coates is forty years old, and Samori is fifteen. The text is not set up as a traditional narrative. Rather, it traces Coates’ thoughts and feelings throughout his life so far. It is loosely chronological though sometimes interrupted with anecdotes out of chronological order. The plot has less to do with specific events and more to do with the way Coates’ thoughts and opinions change over time.
Part I begins in the present, as a host for a news show interviews Coates. She asks Coates what it means to lose his body, and he answers her with all the knowledge he has gained over the years. Coates turns to his childhood, describing his life and family as he was growing up in the ghettos of West Baltimore. He first understands the gap between his Black world and the suburban white world in childhood, though he cannot articulate the reasons for the separation. Coates begins to give form to his thoughts by reading the many books on Africana that his father owns. He develops a belief system similar to that of Malcolm X and disagrees with the idea of non-violent protests.
Coates attends Howard University, and he evolves his beliefs significantly during this time. He constantly studies, reads, and questions everything. He turns to Chancellor Williams’ The Destruction of Black Civilization as his main guidebook. He begins to think of Black people as “kings in exile,” severed from their nation by plundering Europeans, and keeps a mental trophy case of African heroes. Debating with older poets and his teachers challenges his views, which leads Coates to journalism. He starts to think about Black history more objectively and less romantically. At Howard, he meets Kenyatta Matthews, and she becomes pregnant at twenty-four. He leaves Howard without a degree and moves with Kenyatta to Delaware, where he works as a freelance writer.
The main event in Part II is the police murder of Prince Jones, whom Coates met at Howard. This is an episode of police brutality in which the officer is not charged. Coates begins to write about Jones’ murder and develops a rage at both the police and all of white America. Coates’ family moves to New York City in 2001, and Coates finds himself unable to sympathize with the victims of the September 11 terrorist attack because he views them all as part of the system that brought down Prince Jones. Coates describes his life in Brooklyn as a new father with young Samori. His thoughts revolve around Samori understanding the weight and struggle he will have to go through as a Black man. The second main event of Part II is a trip to France. Travel opens Coates’ eyes to worlds outside of America. He realizes how much fear has damaged his life, and is able to better place himself in the larger context of the world as a whole.
In Part III, Coates visits Prince Jones’ mother, Dr. Mable Jones. He is amazed by her composure and compares it to the steady determination of his grandmother and the protestors at sit-ins in the 1960s. Dr. Jones speaks about her own history and tells Coates more about Prince. After leaving, Coates sits in his car and rethinks his views of non-violent protestors. He used to think they were shameful not to fight for themselves, but he now believes they may have known that there was never any security to fight for in the first place. He reflects on attending Howard University’s homecoming and the sense of Black power he felt within that group of people. His parting message to his son is to remind Samori to engage fully in the struggle of his life as a Black person, but to know he is not responsible for converting white people to the struggle. Coates is confident that white America will continue to plunder not only Black bodies but the environment, too. The text thus begins and ends discussing the white assault against the Black body."
Searching,"Siddhartha, the handsome and respected son of a Brahmin, lives with his father in ancient India. Everyone in the village expects Siddhartha to be a successful Brahmin like his father. Siddhartha enjoys a near-idyllic existence with his best friend, Govinda, but he is secretly dissatisfied. He performs all the rituals of religion, and he does what religion says should bring him happiness and peace. Nonetheless, he feels something is missing. His father and the other elders have still not achieved enlightenment, and he feels that staying with them will not settle the questions he has about the nature of his existence. Siddhartha believes his father has already passed on all the wisdom their community has to offer, but he longs for something more. 
One day, a group of wandering ascetics called Samanas passes through town. They are starved and almost naked and have come to beg for food. They believe enlightenment can be reached through asceticism, a rejection of the body and physical desire. The path the Samanas preach is quite different from the one Siddhartha has been taught, and he believes it may provide some of the answers he is looking for. He decides to follow this new path. Siddhartha’s father does not want him to join the Samanas, but he cannot dissuade Siddhartha. Govinda also wants to find a path to enlightenment, and he joins Siddhartha in this new life.
	Siddhartha adjusts quickly to the ways of the Samanas because of the patience and discipline he learned in the Brahmin tradition. He learns how to free himself from the traditional trappings of life, and so loses his desire for property, clothing, sexuality, and all sustenance except that required to live. His goal is to find enlightenment by eliminating his Self, and he successfully renounces the pleasures of the world. 
Sunburned and half-starved, Siddhartha soon ceases to resemble the boy he used to be. Govinda is quick to praise the Samanas and notes the considerable moral and spiritual improvements they both have achieved since joining. Siddhartha, however, is still dissatisfied. The path of self-denial does not provide a permanent solution for him. He points out that the oldest Samanas have lived the life for many years but have yet to attain true spiritual enlightenment. The Samanas have been as unsuccessful as the Brahmins Siddhartha and Govinda left behind. At this time, Siddhartha and the other Samanas begin to hear about a new holy man named Gotama the Buddha who has attained the total spiritual enlightenment called Nirvana. Govinda convinces Siddhartha they both should leave the Samanas and seek out Gotama. Siddhartha and Govinda inform the leader of the Samanas of their decision to leave. The leader is clearly displeased, but Siddhartha silences him with an almost magical, hypnotizing gaze. 
Siddhartha and Govinda find Gotama’s camp of followers and are taken in. Siddhartha is initially pleased with Gotama, and he and Govinda are instructed in the Eightfold Path, the four main points, and other aspects of Buddhism. However, while Govinda is convinced to join Gotama and his followers, Siddhartha still has doubts. He has noticed a contradiction in Gotama’s teachings: Siddhartha questions how one can embrace the unity of all things, as the Buddha asks, if they are also being told to overcome the physical world. Siddhartha realizes Buddhism will not give him the answers he needs. Sadly, he leaves Govinda behind and begins a search for the meaning of life, the achievement of which he feels will not be dependent on religious instruction. 
	Siddhartha decides to embark on a life free from meditation and the spiritual quests he has been pursuing, and to instead learn from the pleasures of the body and the material world. In his new wanderings, Siddhartha meets a friendly ferryman, fully content with his simple life. Siddhartha crosses the ferryman’s river and comes to a city. Here, a beautiful courtesan named Kamala entrances him. He knows she would be the best one to teach him about the world of love, but Kamala will not have him unless he proves he can fit into the material world. She convinces him to take up the path of the merchant. With her help, Siddhartha soon finds employment with a merchant named Kamaswami and begins to learn the trade. While Siddhartha learns the wisdom of the business world and begins to master the skills Kamaswami teaches him, Kamala becomes his lover and teaches him what she knows about love.
	Years pass, and Siddhartha’s business acumen increases. Soon, he is a rich man and enjoys the benefits of an affluent life. He gambles, drinks, and dances, and anything that can be bought in the material world is his for the taking. Siddhartha is detached from this life, however, and he can never see it as more than a game. He doesn’t care if he wins or loses this game because it doesn’t touch his spirit in any lasting way. The more he obtains in the material world, the less it satisfies him, and he is soon caught in a cycle of unhappiness that he tries to escape by engaging in even more gambling, drinking, and sex. When he is at his most disillusioned, he dreams that Kamala’s rare songbird is dead in its cage. He understands that the material world is slowly killing him without providing him with the enlightenment for which he has been searching. One night, he resolves to leave it all behind and departs without notifying either Kamala or Kamaswami. 
Sick at heart, Siddhartha wanders until he finds a river. He considers drowning himself, but he instead falls asleep on the riverbank. While he is sleeping, Govinda, who is now a Buddhist monk, passes by. Not recognizing Siddhartha, he watches over the sleeping man to protect him from snakes. Siddhartha immediately recognizes Govinda when he wakes up, but Govinda notes that Siddhartha has changed significantly from his days with the Samanas and now appears to be a rich man. Siddhartha responds that he is currently neither a Samana nor a rich man. Siddhartha wishes to become someone new. Govinda soon leaves to continue on his journey, and Siddhartha sits by the river and considers where his life has taken him. 
	Siddhartha seeks out the same content ferryman he met years before. The ferryman, who introduces himself as Vasudeva, radiates an inner peace that Siddhartha wishes to attain. Vasudeva says he himself has attained this sense of peace through many years of studying the river. Siddhartha expresses a desire to likewise learn from the river, and Vasudeva agrees to let Siddhartha live and work beside him. Siddhartha studies the river and begins to take from it a spiritual enlightenment unlike any he has ever known. While sitting by the river, he contemplates the unity of all life, and in the river’s voice he hears the word Om. 

	One day Kamala the courtesan approaches the ferry along with her son on a pilgrimage to visit Gotama, who is said to be dying. Before they can cross, a snake bites Kamala. Siddhartha and Vasudeva tend to Kamala, but the bite kills her. Before she dies, she tells Siddhartha that he is the father of her eleven-year-old son. Siddhartha does his best to console and provide for his son, but the boy is spoiled and cynical. Siddhartha’s son dislikes life with the two ferrymen and wishes to return to his familiar city and wealth. Vasudeva believes Siddhartha’s son should be allowed to leave if he wants to, but Siddhartha is not ready to let him go. One morning, Siddhartha awakens to find his son has run away and stolen all of his and Vasudeva’s money. Siddhartha chases after the boy, but as he reaches the city he realizes the chase is futile. Vasudeva follows Siddhartha and brings him back to their home by the river, instructing him to soothe the pain of losing his son by listening to the river.
	Siddhartha studies the river for many years, and Vasudeva teaches Siddhartha how to learn the many secrets the river has to tell. In contemplating the river, Siddhartha has a revelation: Just as the water of the river flows into the ocean and is returned by rain, all forms of life are interconnected in a cycle without beginning or end. Birth and death are all part of a timeless unity. Life and death, joy and sorrow, good and evil are all parts of the whole and are necessary to understand the meaning of life. By the time Siddhartha has learned all the river’s lessons, Vasudeva announces that he is through with his life at the river. He retires into the forest, leaving Siddhartha to be the ferryman.
	The novel ends with Govinda returning to the river to seek enlightenment by meeting with a wise man who lives there. When Govinda arrives, he does not recognize that the wise man is Siddhartha himself. Govinda is still a follower of Gotama but has yet to attain the kind of enlightenment that Siddhartha now radiates, and he asks Siddhartha to teach him what he knows. Siddhartha explains that neither he nor anyone can teach the wisdom to Govinda, because verbal explanations are limited and can never communicate the entirety of enlightenment. Instead, he asks Govinda to kiss him on the forehead, and when Govinda does, the vision of unity that Siddhartha has experienced is communicated instantly to Govinda. Govinda and Siddhartha have both finally achieved the enlightenment they set out to find in the days of their youth."
Settled,"In the late nineteenth century, a man named Samuel Hamilton settles in the Salinas Valley in northern California. He brings his strict but loving wife, Liza, with him from Ireland. Although Samuel is well respected in the community, he never becomes a wealthy man. The Hamiltons go on to have nine children and become a prominent family in the valley.
Adam Trask, meanwhile, settles in the valley with his pregnant wife Cathy where he eventually becomes friends with Samuel Hamilton. Before moving to California, Adam lives on a farm in Connecticut with his half-brother, Charles. The dark and moody Charles resents the fact that his and Adam’s father, Cyrus, has always favored the good-natured Adam. Upon his death, Cyrus leaves his sons a large and unexpected fortune, probably stolen during his days as an administrator in the U.S. Army. Despite their newfound wealth, Adam and Charles remain unable to get along. Charles is disgusted at his brother’s marriage to Cathy, who, unbeknownst to Adam or Charles, is a former prostitute who murdered her parents and stole their money. Although Charles despises Cathy, he takes her into his bed after she drugs Adam on their wedding night.
Adam and Cathy move to California, as Adam proves unable to live peacefully with Charles in Connecticut. In Salinas, Cathy learns she is pregnant and attempts to abort her baby in order to prevent any furtherance of ties to her husband. She is desperate to escape Adam despite the fact that he loves her and provides for her. The abortion is unsuccessful, and Cathy eventually gives birth to twins, Aron and Caleb (Cal). It is clear from the start, however, that Cathy does not care about the infants and wants to leave the household as soon as possible. One day, Cathy shoots Adam, flees the house, and moves to Salinas proper to resume her life as a prostitute. Adam decides to cover for Cathy by lying to the local sheriff and saying that his gunshot wound was an accident.
Cathy wins the trust of Faye, the madam of a local brothel, then poisons her and fools the doctors and other prostitutes into thinking that Faye died naturally. Cathy assumes control of the brothel and starts to blackmail powerful men in Salinas with photographs of them performing sadomasochistic sex acts with her and her prostitutes. To protect the dazed Adam and his twin boys, neither Samuel Hamilton nor Lee, Adam’s housekeeper, tells Adam or the boys that Cathy works at a brothel.
As the twins grow older, Aron manifests his father’s good heart, whereas Cal exhibits his mother’s ruthlessness and tendency to manipulate. By the time they reach early adolescence, however, Cal actively struggles against his dark side and prays to God to make him more like Aron. Adam, meanwhile, remains melancholy and listless for years after Cathy’s departure. In order to jolt Adam out of his despondency, Samuel finally tells him the truth about Cathy. Samuel dies soon afterward.
After Samuel’s funeral, Adam visits Cathy at the brothel. Her deteriorating body and cynical, vulgar talk make Adam realize that he can now move on and forget her, as she is a repugnant creature who has become irrelevant to his life. Cathy, however, is desperate to retain power over Adam. She even offers to have sex with him to keep him in the brothel and prove that he is no better than she. Adam refuses and leaves with a serene smile.
After his triumph over Cathy, Adam becomes a livelier and more committed father to his boys. Adam decides to move the family off the ranch and into the town of Salinas so that Aron and Cal can attend school. The twins are assigned to the seventh grade, and Aron begins a relationship with Abra, the goodhearted daughter of a corrupt county supervisor. Cal continues to struggle with his dark side, and when he finally happens to discover the truth about his mother, he believes that her evil has been passed down to him. But Adam’s housekeeper, Lee, who has extensively researched the biblical story of Cain and Abel, advises Cal that God intends each individual to choose his own moral destiny rather than be constrained by the legacy of his parents. This idea, encapsulated by the Hebrew word timshel (meaning “thou mayest”), counters Cal’s fatalistic idea that he has inherited his mother’s evil and sin.
Aron gradually withdraws into religious fervor in order to shield himself from the corruption of the world—an approach that Abra and Lee consider cowardly. Adam, meanwhile, squanders the family fortune on a poorly executed business venture involving refrigerated shipping of vegetables. Aron graduates from high school early and leaves for Stanford University. Adam misses Aron terribly, thinking him smarter and more ambitious than Cal.
However, Cal, in collaboration with Will Hamilton, one of Samuel’s sons, works secretly to earn back the fortune his father lost on the failed refrigeration business. Cal also hopes to make enough money to pay for Aron’s tuition at Stanford. In the strained economy of World War I, Will and Cal buy beans from local farmers at an unfairly low price and sell the beans, in turn, to desperate British buyers at an unfairly high price. The venture nets Cal thousands of dollars, which he plans to give to his father as a gift at Thanksgiving.
Aron, who is miserable at Stanford, comes home for Thanksgiving. Adam is thrilled to see Aron but appalled by Cal’s gift of money. Adam considers the money to be earned dishonestly and tells Cal to give it back to the farmers from whom he stole it. Enraged and jealous of Adam’s obvious preference for Aron, Cal loses control of his anger and rashly tells Aron the truth about their mother, Cathy. When Cal takes Aron to the brothel to show him that Cathy is still alive, the revelation crushes the fragile Aron, who screams incoherently and runs away. The next day, the shattered Aron joins the Army, while Cathy, horrified by her son’s reaction to her, commits suicide by overdosing on morphine. She leaves her entire fortune—part of it inherited from Charles, part of it earned through blackmail and prostitution—to Aron.
When Adam discovers that Aron has joined the Army, he lapses into a state of shock. Lee talks to Cal about the idea of timshel and urges Cal to remember that, despite his guilt, he is a normal, flawed human being—not an aberrant embodiment of evil. This discussion makes Cal feel somewhat better, and he is able to begin a relationship with Abra, who is no longer in love with Aron.
A telegram arrives informing the family that Aron has been killed in World War I. Adam has a severe stroke upon hearing the news, and Lee brings Abra and Cal to see Adam on his deathbed. Lee informs Adam that the guilt-stricken Cal told Aron about their mother only because Cal was convinced that their father loved Aron more than him. Lee asks Adam to offer his blessing to Cal before he dies. At this, Adam raises his hand and whispers the single word timshel."
Colonial,"In Common Sense, Thomas Paine argues for American independence. His argument begins with more general, theoretical reflections about government and religion, then progresses onto the specifics of the colonial situation.
Paine begins by distinguishing between government and society. Society, according to Paine, is everything constructive and good that people join together to accomplish. Government, on the other hand, is an institution whose sole purpose is to protect us from our own vices. Government has its origins in the evil of man and is therefore a necessary evil at best. Paine says that government's sole purpose is to protect life, liberty and property, and that a government should be judged solely on the basis of the extent to which it accomplishes this goal.
Paine then considers an imagined scenario in which a small group of people has been placed on an island, and cut off from the rest of society. In time, these people develop ties with one another, and lawmaking becomes inevitable. Paine says the people will be much happier if they are responsible for the creation of the laws that rule them. Paine is also implicitly arguing that such a system of representation is also better for the American colonists. Having expressed his disagreement with British reign in America, Paine proceeds to launch a general attack on the British system of government. Paine says the British system is too complex and rife with contradictions, and that the monarchy is granted far too much power. The British system pretends to offer a reasonable system of checks and balances, but in fact, it does not.
From here Paine moves on to discuss, in general, the notions of monarchy and hereditary succession. Man, Pain argues, was born into a state of equality, and the distinction that has arisen between king and subject is an unnatural one. At first, Paine says, the world was without kings, but the ancient Jews decided they wanted a king. This angered God, but he allowed them to have one. Paine presents pages of biblical evidence detailing God's wrath at the idea of the Jews having a king. The conclusion Paine reaches is that the practice of monarchy originates from sin, and is an institution that the Bible and God condemn. Paine calls hereditary succession an abominable practice. He says that even if people were to choose to have a king, that does not legitimize that King's child acting as a future ruler. Furthermore, hereditary succession has brought with it innumerable evils, such as incompetent kings, corruption, and civil war.
Having dispensed with the preliminary theoretical issues, Paine sets in to discuss the details of the American situation. In response to the argument that America has flourished under British rule, and therefore ought to stay under the king, Paine says that such an argument fails to realize that America has evolved and no longer needs Britain's help. Some say that Britain has protected America, and therefore deserves allegiance, but Paine responds that Britain has only watched over America in order to secure its own economic well-being. Paine adds that most recently, instead of watching over the colonies, the British have been attacking them, and are therefore undeserving of American loyalty.
Paine says that the colonies have little to gain from remaining attached to Britain. Commerce can be better conducted with the rest of Europe, but only after America becomes independent. Paine also asserts that if the colonies remain attached to Britain, the same problems that have arisen in the past will arise in the future. Paine argues that it is necessary to seek independence now, as to do otherwise would only briefly cover up problems that will surely reemerge.
Paine even proposes the form of government that the independent colonies should adopt. His recommendation is for a representative democracy that gives roughly equal weight to each of the colonies.
Paine explains why the current time is a good time to break free of Britain. Primarily, Paine focuses on the present size of the colonies, and on their current capabilities. He presents an inventory of the British Navy and gives calculations revealing how America could build a navy of comparable size. Paine recommends this as a way of ensuring America's security and prosperity in trade. Paine also argues that America is sufficiently small as to be united now. If time were to elapse, and the population of the colonies to grow, the same feeling of unity would not be present. Paine adds that if the Americans revolt now, they can use the vast expanses of uncharted land to the West in order to pay down some of the debt they will incur.
Paine says that as a colony of Britain, America lacks respectability on the international scene. They are seen simply as rebels, and cannot form substantial alliances with other nations. In order to prosper in the long term, the colonies need to be independent. Paine says that, by declaring independence, America will be able to ask for the help of other countries in its struggle for freedom. For all of these reasons, Paine says it is imperative and urgent that the colonies declare independence."
Freedmen,"In this book, originally published in 1903, W. E. B. Du Bois has collected fourteen of his own essays about life after the Civil War, especially in the South. While the book predominantly deals with Black society and the life of “freedmen,” it also discusses how white society evolved after Emancipation. Throughout the text, Du Bois presents specific examples of racial injustice and inequality in the South. Before each essay, Du Bois includes a poem (or an excerpt from a poem or song) appropriate to the essay’s subject matter. Every inclusion is “a bar of the Sorrow Songs,—some echo of haunting melody from the only American music which welled up from the black souls in the dark past.” Du Bois revisits the significance of these inclusions at the end of the book.
While each essay examines a particular piece of the evolution of Black society, they are arranged to give the reader a historical perspective. Chapter I and Chapter II deal with the history and immediate impact of Emancipation, using historical examples and Du Bois’s own experience. Chapter III. specifically discusses the formation and responsibility of Black leadership, while criticizing Booker T. Washington on an academic level. Du Bois goes on to describe the Atlanta Compromise and the limitations it has placed on Black society in the South. Chapter IV through Chapter VII discuss the need for progress, and how it is blocked by lack of education and opportunity. He stresses that current systems produce mostly laborers, and that there is little room for Black upward mobility, especially in the South, due to a lack of education (and college-educated individuals). In Chapter VIII and Chapter IX, Du Bois describes visiting Dougherty County in rural Georgia. His first-hand experiences there are contrasted with his upbringing in New England, to show not only that there is greater disparity in the South, but also that many Black people in the South are not fully aware of it. In Chapter VI and Chapter VII, Du Bois draws on analogies to mythology to better explain the challenges he sees in the upbringing of Black men. In Chapter X., Du Bois examines the religion of the Black South. 
Chapters XI, XII, and XIII offer narrative examples of individuals Du Bois has encountered and events from Du Bois’s own life to illustrate the disparity between white and Black society. He discusses the death of his young son, pays tribute to a world-traveling preacher who remained undiscouraged, and recalls a student who had great potential but was a victim of his circumstances. Du Bois admits that these men are not well-known to history, but he considers their experiences are worthy of study. The final chapter, Chapter XIV, has several selections of “Sorrow Songs” that Du Bois describes as the “spiritual heritage of the nation.” He describes how the songs have been handed down, many from before slavery, and how they have become interconnected with religion and are still a centerpiece in Black society. 
Throughout the work, Du Bois uses historical fact and narrative example to establish how slavery and its aftereffects have shaped both Black and white society in the South. As a teacher, he then examines each situation academically. He presents cause and effect relationships and applies sociological analysis to them. The largest problem Du Bois discusses is the shortage of resources and opportunity for Black people at the beginning of the 20th century. He points out the effects of disparities in education and privilege and demonstrates the need for change."
Measurable,"The convict Jean Valjean is released from a French prison after serving nineteen years for stealing a loaf of bread and for subsequent attempts to escape from prison. When Valjean arrives at the town of Digne, no one is willing to give him shelter because he is an ex-convict. Desperate, Valjean knocks on the door of M. Myriel, the kindly bishop of Digne. Myriel treats Valjean with kindness, and Valjean repays the bishop by stealing his silverware. When the police arrest Valjean, Myriel covers for him, claiming that the silverware was a gift. The authorities release Valjean and Myriel makes him promise to become an honest man. Eager to fulfill his promise, Valjean masks his identity and enters the town of Montreuil-sur-mer. Under the assumed name of Madeleine, Valjean invents an ingenious manufacturing process that brings the town prosperity. He eventually becomes the town’s mayor.
Fantine, a young woman from Montreuil, lives in Paris. She falls in love with Tholomyès, a wealthy student who gets her pregnant and then abandons her. Fantine returns to her home village with her daughter, Cosette. On the way to Montreuil, however, Fantine realizes that she will never be able to find work if the townspeople know that she has an illegitimate child. In the town of Montfermeil, she meets the Thénardiers, a family that runs the local inn. The Thénardiers agree to look after Cosette as long as Fantine sends them a monthly allowance.
In Montreuil, Fantine finds work in Madeleine’s factory. Fantine’s coworkers find out about Cosette, however, and Fantine is fired. The Thénardiers demand more money to support Cosette, and Fantine resorts to prostitution to make ends meet. One night, Javert, Montreuil’s police chief, arrests Fantine. She is to be sent to prison, but Madeleine intervenes. Fantine has fallen ill, and when she longs to see Cosette, Madeleine promises to send for her. First, however, he must contend with Javert, who has discovered Madeleine’s criminal past. Javert tells Madeleine that a man has been accused of being Jean Valjean, and Madeleine confesses his true identity. Javert shows up to arrest Valjean while Valjean is at Fantine’s bedside, and Fantine dies from the shock.
After a few years, Valjean escapes from prison and heads to Montfermeil, where he is able to buy Cosette from the Thénardiers. The Thénardiers turn out to be a family of scoundrels who abuse Cosette while spoiling their own two daughters, Eponine and Azelma. Valjean and Cosette move to a run-down part of Paris. Javert discovers their hideout, however, and they are forced to flee. They find refuge in a convent, where Cosette attends school and Valjean works as a gardener.
Marius Pontmercy is a young man who lives with his wealthy grandfather, M. Gillenormand. Because of political differences within the family, Marius has never met his father, Georges Pontmercy. After his father dies, however, Marius learns more about him and comes to admire his father’s democratic politics. Angry with his grandfather, Marius moves out of Gillenormand’s house and lives as a poor young law student. While in law school, Marius associates with a group of radical students, the Friends of the ABC, who are led by the charismatic Enjolras. One day, Marius sees Cosette at a public park. It is love at first sight, but the protective Valjean does his utmost to prevent Cosette and Marius from ever meeting. Their paths cross once again, however, when Valjean makes a charitable visit to Marius’s poor neighbors, the Jondrettes. The Jondrettes are in fact the Thénardiers, who have lost their inn and moved to Paris under an assumed name. After Valjean leaves, Thénardier announces a plan to rob Valjean when he returns. Alarmed, Marius alerts the local police inspector, who turns out to be Javert. The ambush is foiled and the Thénardiers are arrested, but Valjean escapes before Javert can identify him.
Thénardier’s daughter Eponine, who is in love with Marius, helps Marius discover Cosette’s whereabouts. Marius is finally able to make contact with Cosette, and the two declare their love for each other. Valjean, however, soon shatters their happiness. Worried that he will lose Cosette and unnerved by political unrest in the city, Valjean announces that he and Cosette are moving to England. In desperation, Marius runs to his grandfather, M. Gillenormand, to ask for M. Gillenormand’s permission to marry Cosette. Their meeting ends in a bitter argument. When Marius returns to Cosette, she and Valjean have disappeared. Heartbroken, Marius decides to join his radical student friends, who have started a political uprising. Armed with two pistols, Marius heads for the barricades.
The uprising seems doomed, but Marius and his fellow students nonetheless stand their ground and vow to fight for freedom and democracy. The students discover Javert among their ranks, and, realizing that he is a spy, Enjolras ties him up. As the army launches its first attack against the students, Eponine throws herself in front of a rifle to save Marius’s life. As Eponine dies in Marius’s arms, she hands him a letter from Cosette. Marius quickly scribbles a reply and orders a boy, Gavroche, to deliver it to Cosette.
Valjean manages to intercept the note and sets out to save the life of the man his daughter loves. Valjean arrives at the barricade and volunteers to execute Javert. When alone with Javert, however, Valjean instead secretly lets him go free. As the army storms the barricade, Valjean grabs the wounded Marius and flees through the sewers. When Valjean emerges hours later, Javert immediately arrests him. Valjean pleads with Javert to let him take the dying Marius to Marius’s grandfather. Javert agrees. Javert feels tormented, torn between his duty to his profession and the debt he owes Valjean for saving his life. Ultimately, Javert lets Valjean go and throws himself into the river, where he drowns.
Marius makes a full recovery and is reconciled with Gillenormand, who consents to Marius and Cosette’s marriage. Their wedding is a happy one, marred only when Valjean confesses his criminal past to Marius. Alarmed by this revelation and unaware that it was Valjean who saved his life at the barricades, Marius tries to prevent Cosette from having contact with Valjean. Lonely and depressed, Valjean takes to his bed and awaits his death. Marius eventually finds out from Thénardier that Valjean saved Marius’s life. Ashamed that he mistrusted Valjean, Marius tells Cosette everything that has happened. Marius and Cosette rush to Valjean’s side just in time for a final reconciliation. Happy to be reunited with his adopted daughter, Valjean dies in peace."
Mechanism,"Darwin’s theory is based on the notion of variation. It argues that the numerous traits and adaptations that differentiate species from each other also explain how species evolved over time and gradually diverged. Variations in organisms are apparent both within domesticated species and within species throughout the natural world. Variations in colors, structures, organs, and physical traits differentiate a multitude of species from one another. Heredity is the mechanism that perpetuates variations, Darwin argues, as traits are passed from parents to offspring. What is important about these variations to Darwin, though, is the way they allow species to adapt and survive in the natural world. He gives numerous examples of variations that illustrate the wondrous adaptations that allow species to survive in their natural environments: the beak that allows the woodpecker to gather insects, the wings that allow the bat to fly, the paddles that allow the porpoise to swim, and so on. Darwin hypothesizes that the minor variations we see within a single species—such as variations in size, shape, and color of organisms—are related to the more distinct variations seen across different species. His theory of evolution explains how variations cause the origin of species.
Natural selection is the key component of Darwin’s theory, as it explains the relationship between variation and the eventual evolution of a species. Borrowing from Thomas Malthus’s principle of exponential population growth, Darwin argues that the possibility of infinite growth of population sizes is checked by the limits of geography and natural resources, which will not allow an infinite number of beings to survive. As a result of limited food, water, shelter, and so on, species must engage in a “struggle for existence,” creating competition for survival. What decides, then, which species will survive and which will become extinct? Here is where “natural selection” comes in. Darwin argues that organisms exhibiting “advantageous variations”—variations that will allow them to adapt to their environment better than other organisms do—will be more likely to survive. Through heredity, these advantageous variations will be passed on to the organisms’ offspring. Eventually, natural selection will allow those species best adapted to their environments to survive and prosper, while species without these advantageous adaptations will lose the struggle for existence and become extinct.
Natural selection is the mechanism that leads to “descent with modification,” Darwin’s term for the process of evolution. Organisms will continually give birth to offspring that carry variations, some of which are advantageous and some of which are not. As advantageous variations are naturally selected and become perpetuated through successive generations, organisms carrying these advantageous variations will diverge from the original species, eventually becoming a species of their own. Continual modification and divergence, then, create a branching scheme of evolution, in which new species continually branch off from old ones. The “branches” help biologists link later species back to an original parent species, identifying the point at which different species are related to one another. Darwin notes that existing classification systems developed by naturalists already show these relationships between species. Darwin’s theory of descent with modification, then, simply provides an explanation for why many species seem so similar: Either they evolved from one another, or they both evolved from a common parent species.
After laying out the main principles of his theory in the early chapters of On the Origin of Species, Darwin devotes much of the rest of the book to defending his theory against criticisms and presenting detailed examples of how natural selection occurs. The geological record is a formidable impediment to Darwin’s theory, as the existing fossil record does not provide the “missing links” in the chains of descent that Darwin proposes. In response, Darwin argues that the geological record is imperfect and that many fossil remains have been destroyed by changes in the earth or have yet to be discovered.
Darwin also attempts to explain how variations occur in species, driving natural selection and the creation of new species. Geographical isolation is a key component of Darwin’s theory. Darwin hypothesizes that because all species originated from one or a few original beings, species needed modes of transportation to migrate between geographical areas throughout the world. Barriers such as oceans and mountain ranges restrict the ability of organisms to migrate, and the few that manage to do so play a large role in shaping the evolution of species on islands and in geographically isolated areas. Geographical isolation accounts for the plethora of unique species on islands, as well as the wider distribution of species across continents.
Darwin’s theory challenged not only the prevailing view of the independent creation of species but also larger claims of religion and science. Darwin explicitly denied the validity of natural theology, which posited that species’ adaptations to their environments was proof of their “intelligent design” by a creator. It was natural selection, not independent creation, that resulted in these adaptations, Darwin argued. Moreover, Darwin’s use of scientific methodology to prove his theory amounted to an explicit critique of naturalists who would attempt to ignore the scientific validity of his theory because of its controversial nature. While the text of The Origin of Species did leave room for religious theology, Darwin’s overall commitment to scientific rationale rather than theological reasoning pitted him against religious doctrine. Darwin’s text was controversial when it was published, and it remains controversial today. However, his theory of natural selection has stood the test of time in scientific circles, and it remains the leading scientific explanation for the origin of species."
