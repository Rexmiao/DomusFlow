Title,Abstract
Legal,"Lawyer Bryan Stevenson gives a first-person account of his decades helping marginalized Americans who have been unfairly and harshly punished by the U.S. criminal justice system, which disproportionately targets people of color and poor people. At the heart of Just Mercy is the story of Walter McMillian, a Black man who was framed for the murder of a girl named Ronda Morrison, convicted, and sent to death row. 
Stevenson alternates chapters about Walter with his personal reflections on our country’s history with racial disparity and issues around incarceration. Stevenson highlights other groups of vulnerable people who have been victimized by the criminal justice system and shares the stories of the prisoners he has helped over the years. The book also follows the growth of Stevenson’s nonprofit law project, the Alabama-based Equal Justice Initiative (EJI), through its expansion from focusing on death row prisoners to helping people sentenced to life without parole. Stevenson chronicles how EJI becomes a significant force in criminal justice reform.
In 1983 as a law student, Stevenson discovers his life’s passion when he interns with the Georgia-based Southern Prisoners Defense Committee and meets his first death row prisoner. After graduation Stevenson accepts a job with the organization to represent poor prisoners, including those in Alabama who lack any public defender. He meets Walter McMillian on Alabama’s death row. Walter owns a successful business but also transgresses racial boundaries when he has an affair with a white woman. Soon after the affair becomes public, the woman’s friend, Ralph Myers, accuses Walter of committing the unsolved murder of Ronda Morrison, which has outraged the community. Law enforcement, including a racist sheriff and the district attorney, eagerly pounces on this accusation, overlooking Walter’s alibi and a lack of evidence. Instead, they actively force Ralph to stick with his story even when he tries to recant. They coerce other false witness testimonies, and—as revealed years later—actively suppress evidence.
After Stevenson and the team at EJI unsuccessfully appeal Walter’s conviction, they launch their own investigation of the crime and uncover new evidence. They find witnesses who can prove the witnesses against Walter lied as well as financial records that indicate that one of these witnesses was paid to give false testimony. Stevenson and his team also petition for and receive all records from Walter’s trial. However, their big break comes when they receive a phone call from Ralph, who now wants to make amends. Ralph admits to lying about Walter and says he was threatened by law enforcement. Stevenson wins a hearing for Walter where he can present his new evidence: Ralph’s testimony, which is confirmed by health care workers and other inmates, as well as recordings of the law enforcement team threatening Ralph if he doesn’t frame Walter. 
While the judge refuses to grant Walter relief, Stevenson continues the appeal process through the Alabama courts. The district attorney asks outside agents to investigate the murder for which Walter was convicted, and the investigators determine that Walter had nothing to do with the crime. Six weeks later, the court invalidates Walter’s conviction. Stevenson and the State file a joint motion to dismiss the charges, and Walter is set free.
Throughout the process, Stevenson and Walter become close friends, and Stevenson helps Walter upon his release, including filing a civil suit on his behalf and offering him a place to stay. Walter works with Stevenson to share his story, giving interviews and speaking at legal conferences, and Walter is even featured in a documentary. Unfortunately, Walter is diagnosed with advancing dementia and is forced to rely on family and eventually a nursing facility for his care. He dies in 2013. Stevenson gives a eulogy at his funeral and shares all he learned from Walter, particularly that we must extend mercy to everyone, even those who have not earned it.
Interspersed with chapters chronicling Walter’s narrative are stories of Stevenson’s other clients and work. His closeness with these prisoners and their horrifying circumstances makes Stevenson more determined to help and causes him to reflect on abstract issues that nevertheless imbue the criminal justice system, like humanity and mercy. Stevenson focuses on several categories of vulnerable people who become trapped in the system, including mentally ill prisoners, disabled prisoners, and poor women who give birth to stillborn babies. 
Stevenson and his team at EJI also become increasingly focused on juvenile offenders who are sometimes tried as adults despite their young age. These offenders may be given de facto death sentences by being sentenced to life without parole and face perilous circumstances when they are housed in adult prisons. Stevenson illustrates how these prisoners retain their own humanity while being forced to live under inhumane conditions. He also discusses some of the qualities common among these types of prisoners: They are generally poor and disproportionately people of color, and most of them lack adequate legal counsel. The juveniles have horrific backgrounds of abuse and neglect.
Stevenson and his team at EJI also work to change the legal system to offer more protection to marginalized people. Several of his cases end up before the U.S. Supreme Court, and he succeeds in winning rulings that ban as unconstitutional the conviction of children to life without parole and the execution of people deemed incompetent from dementia or neurological disease. EJI works to raise public awareness of issues surrounding unfair incarceration, produces groundbreaking reports on racial issues, and sets up programs to help formerly incarcerated people adjust to life on the outside.
Stevenson also reflects on the issues that surround the criminal justice system. His time spent with prisoners awaiting their execution makes him realize how inhumane it is to prepare another human to die. After decades of work, when Stevenson fails to prevent the execution of a man who suffers from an intellectual disability, he momentarily feels unable to continue his work. However, he realizes that he cannot help but be broken by his experiences and comes to understand that it is his own brokenness that allows him to more fully understand the need for mercy and to bring compassion to others. The book ends with Stevenson’s renewed commitment to helping others."
Onto,"Bri Jackson, the narrator of the novel, is a 16-year-old girl from Garden Heights, a predominantly Black inner-city neighborhood. Bri has her sights set on rap stardom, hoping to follow in the footsteps of her late father, the underground rap star Lawless. As the novel opens, Bri is nervously awaiting the phone call that could be her big break: an invitation to perform in the Ring, a local club where up-and-coming rappers face off in “battles.” But first, she must endure her ACT prep class at Midtown School of the Arts so she can get her confiscated phone back from her teacher. Bri’s two best friends from Garden Heights, Sonny and Malik, are in the class with her. Like many of the other students of color at Midtown Academy, they are bused in from less affluent neighborhoods. 
By the time Bri finally gets the call to battle at the Ring, both her teacher and her mother, Jay, have reminded her that school, not rap, is the key to her future. But Bri remains fixated on rap stardom as the solution to her family’s financial problems, especially after she learns that Jay, a recovering drug addict, has lost her job. Bri’s Aunt Pooh, a gang member and a drug dealer, escorts Bri to the battle at the Ring, where she squares off with Milez, another teen rapper. In the first round of the battle, Milez raps about Lawless’s murder, shocking Bri and causing her to freeze up when it is her turn to rap. But she soon recovers and outperforms Milez in the next two rounds, winning the battle decisively. By the following morning, a video of the battle is on YouTube and all Bri’s classmates are praising her for her skills.  
Bri’s celebration is short-lived, however. Tate and Long, two school security guards who have a reputation for targeting Black and Latinx students, single Bri out to have her bag searched. When Bri objects, they violently throw her to the ground and cuff her. Bri is suspended for having candy—which her principal refers to as ""contraband—in her backpack. The security guards are suspended too, pending an investigation, but rumors circulate around the school that Bri is a drug dealer.   
Angry about the assault and people’s racist assumptions about her, Bri writes and records a defiant song called “On the Come Up.” In the song, Bri rails against racist police and other authority figures. She also boasts about having a gun and being ready to use it—because that’s what people expect anyway—even though she barely knows anything about guns. Bri shares the recording with Supreme, her father’s old manager, who promises to make her famous. Supreme releases “On the Come Up” online, where it gets picked up by a Black gossip blog and goes viral. Many of Bri’s friends love the song, but Aunt Pooh, Malik, and Trey all chastise Bri for misrepresenting herself and rapping about gang violence that she has never taken part in.  
Real violence breaks out when Tate and Long are reinstated as the school security guards. Students of color protest outside the school while chanting some of the violent lyrics from “On the Come Up.” When Tate and Long warn them to stop, some students attack the security guards, and a riot ensues. A local news station reports that Bri’s song incited the violence. Jay sees the newscast, learns about Bri’s song for the first time, and insists that Bri stop rapping, lay low, and focus on school. Instead, Bri takes to Instagram and is interviewed by a local radio show, defiantly claiming on both platforms that she won’t be silenced. During the radio interview, Bri has to be restrained after DJ Hype insults her with sexist taunts. Bri begins to feel as though she’s becoming the violent person that others assume she is.  
Meanwhile, Bri’s family continues to struggle, falling behind on bills and rent. The electric company shuts off the power and the landlord threatens eviction. Jay quits school, setting aside her dreams so she can become eligible for food stamps. To make matters worse, the Crowns, a rival gang, rob Bri and Malik at gunpoint, taking her father’s gold chain. Aunt Pooh vows to get revenge on the Crowns and disappears for ten days. When she returns, Aunt Pooh is arrested in a drug bust and taken to jail while Bri looks on.  
With her family’s struggles in mind, Bri goes to a recording studio again, this time with Supreme. Supreme encourages Bri to embrace the persona of a “hoodlum” in her music because that is what people expect of Black rappers. He has another rapper write a song for Bri to record. Even though Bri does not agree with the lyrics, she reluctantly agrees to record the song, hoping to impress a white record executive.  
Bri returns to the Ring once more, where she is supposed to perform the song she recorded. Instead, Bri freestyles her own lyrics about refusing to be what people think she should be. The record executive angrily walks out, but the crowd goes wild. Later, an unnamed celebrity retweets the video of Bri’s freestyle and calls her the future of hip-hop. Bri decides that she will pursue a rap career, but only if she can do it on her own terms."
St,"In a series of vignettes, The House on Mango Street covers a year in the life of Esperanza, a Chicana (Mexican-American girl), who is about twelve years old when the novel begins. During the year, she moves with her family into a house on Mango Street. The house is a huge improvement from the family’s previous apartment, and it is the first home her parents actually own. However, the house is not what Esperanza has dreamed of, because it is run-down and small. The house is in the center of a crowded Latino neighborhood in Chicago, a city where many of the poor areas are racially segregated. Esperanza does not have any privacy, and she resolves that she will someday leave Mango Street and have a house all her own.
Esperanza matures significantly during the year, both sexually and emotionally. The novel charts her life as she makes friends, grows hips, develops her first crush, endures sexual assault, and begins to write as a way of expressing herself and as a way to escape the neighborhood. The novel also includes the stories of many of Esperanza’s neighbors, giving a full picture of the neighborhood and showing the many possible paths Esperanza may follow in the future.
After moving to the house, Esperanza quickly befriends Lucy and Rachel, two Chicana girls who live across the street. Lucy, Rachel, Esperanza, and Esperanza’s little sister, Nenny, have many adventures in the small space of their neighborhood. They buy a bike, learn exciting stories about boys from a young woman named Marin, explore a junk shop, and have intimate conversations while playing Double Dutch (jumping rope). The girls are on the brink of puberty and sometimes find themselves sexually vulnerable, such as when they walk around their neighborhood in high-heeled shoes or when Esperanza is kissed by an older man at her first job. During the first half of the year, the girls are content to live and play in their child’s world. At school, Esperanza feels ashamed about her family’s poverty and her difficult-to-pronounce name. She secretly writes poems that she shares only with older women she trusts.
Over the summer, Esperanza slips into puberty. She suddenly likes it when boys watch her dance, and she enjoys dreaming about them. Esperanza’s newfound sexual maturity, combined with the death of two of her family members, her grandfather and her Aunt Lupe, bring her closer to the world of adults. She begins to closely watch the women in her neighborhood. This second half of The House on Mango Street presents a string of stories about older women in the neighborhood, all of whom are even more stuck in their situations and, quite literally, in their houses, than Esperanza is. Meanwhile, during the beginning of the following school year, Esperanza befriends Sally, a girl her age who is more sexually mature than Lucy or Rachel. Sally, meanwhile, has her own agenda. She uses boys and men as an escape route from her abusive father. Esperanza is not completely comfortable with Sally’s sexual experience, and their friendship results in a crisis when Sally leaves Esperanza alone, and a group of boys sexually assaults Esperanza in her absence.
Esperanza’s traumatic experiences as Sally’s friend, in conjunction with her detailed observations of the older women in her neighborhood, cement her desire to escape Mango Street and to have her own house. When Esperanza finds herself emotionally ready to leave her neighborhood, however, she discovers that she will never fully be able to leave Mango Street behind, and that after she leaves she’ll have to return to help the women she has left. At the end of the year, Esperanza remains on Mango Street, but she has matured extensively. She has a stronger desire to leave and understands that writing will help her put distance between herself and her situation. Though for now writing helps her escape only emotionally, in the future it may help her to escape physically as well."
Public,"The full title of Swift's pamphlet is ""A Modest Proposal for Preventing the Children of Poor People from Being a Burthen to their Parents, or the Country, and for Making them Beneficial to the Publick."" The tract is an ironically conceived attempt to ""find out a fair, cheap, and easy Method"" for converting the starving children of Ireland into ""sound and useful members of the Commonwealth."" Across the country poor children, predominantly Catholics, are living in squalor because their families are too poor to keep them fed and clothed.
The author argues, by hard-edged economic reasoning as well as from a self-righteous moral stance, for a way to turn this problem into its own solution. His proposal, in effect, is to fatten up these undernourished children and feed them to Ireland's rich land-owners. Children of the poor could be sold into a meat market at the age of one, he argues, thus combating overpopulation and unemployment, sparing families the expense of child-bearing while providing them with a little extra income, improving the culinary experience of the wealthy, and contributing to the overall economic well-being of the nation.
The author offers statistical support for his assertions and gives specific data about the number of children to be sold, their weight and price, and the projected consumption patterns. He suggests some recipes for preparing this delicious new meat, and he feels sure that innovative cooks will be quick to generate more. He also anticipates that the practice of selling and eating children will have positive effects on family morality: husbands will treat their wives with more respect, and parents will value their children in ways hitherto unknown. His conclusion is that the implementation of this project will do more to solve Ireland's complex social, political, and economic problems than any other measure that has been proposed."
Magnificent,"The epic’s prelude offers a general introduction to Gilgamesh, king of Uruk, who was two-thirds god and one-third man. He built magnificent ziggurats, or temple towers, surrounded his city with high walls, and laid out its orchards and fields. He was physically beautiful, immensely strong, and very wise. Although Gilgamesh was godlike in body and mind, he began his kingship as a cruel despot. He lorded over his subjects, raping any woman who struck his fancy, whether she was the wife of one of his warriors or the daughter of a nobleman. He accomplished his building projects with forced labor, and his exhausted subjects groaned under his oppression. The gods heard his subjects’ pleas and decided to keep Gilgamesh in check by creating a wild man named Enkidu, who was as magnificent as Gilgamesh. Enkidu became Gilgamesh’s great friend, and Gilgamesh’s heart was shattered when Enkidu died of an illness inflicted by the gods. Gilgamesh then traveled to the edge of the world and learned about the days before the deluge and other secrets of the gods, and he recorded them on stone tablets.
The epic begins with Enkidu. He lives with the animals, suckling at their breasts, grazing in the meadows, and drinking at their watering places. A hunter discovers him and sends a temple prostitute into the wilderness to tame him. In that time, people considered women and sex calming forces that could domesticate wild men like Enkidu and bring them into the civilized world. When Enkidu sleeps with the woman, the animals reject him since he is no longer one of them. Now, he is part of the human world. Then the harlot teaches him everything he needs to know to be a man. Enkidu is outraged by what he hears about Gilgamesh’s excesses, so he travels to Uruk to challenge him. When he arrives, Gilgamesh is about to force his way into a bride’s wedding chamber. Enkidu steps into the doorway and blocks his passage. The two men wrestle fiercely for a long time, and Gilgamesh finally prevails. After that, they become friends and set about looking for an adventure to share. 
Gilgamesh and Enkidu decide to steal trees from a distant cedar forest forbidden to mortals. A terrifying demon named Humbaba, the devoted servant of Enlil, the god of earth, wind, and air, guards it. The two heroes make the perilous journey to the forest, and, standing side by side, fight with the monster. With assistance from Shamash the sun god, they kill him. Then they cut down the forbidden trees, fashion the tallest into an enormous gate, make the rest into a raft, and float on it back to Uruk. Upon their return, Ishtar, the goddess of love, is overcome with lust for Gilgamesh. Gilgamesh spurns her. Enraged, the goddess asks her father, Anu, the god of the sky, to send the Bull of Heaven to punish him. The bull comes down from the sky, bringing with him seven years of famine. Gilgamesh and Enkidu wrestle with the bull and kill it. The gods meet in council and agree that one of the two friends must be punished for their transgression, and they decide Enkidu is going to die. He takes ill, suffers immensely, and shares his visions of the underworld with Gilgamesh. When he finally dies, Gilgamesh is heartbroken.
Gilgamesh can’t stop grieving for Enkidu, and he can’t stop brooding about the prospect of his own death. Exchanging his kingly garments for animal skins as a way of mourning Enkidu, he sets off into the wilderness, determined to find Utnapishtim, the Mesopotamian Noah. After the flood, the gods had granted Utnapishtim eternal life, and Gilgamesh hopes that Utnapishtim can tell him how he might avoid death too. Gilgamesh’s journey takes him to the twin-peaked mountain called Mashu, where the sun sets into one side of the mountain at night and rises out of the other side in the morning. Utnapishtim lives beyond the mountain, but the two scorpion monsters that guard its entrance refuse to allow Gilgamesh into the tunnel that passes through it. Gilgamesh pleads with them, and they relent. 
After a harrowing passage through total darkness, Gilgamesh emerges into a beautiful garden by the sea. There he meets Siduri, a veiled tavern keeper, and tells her about his quest. She warns him that seeking immortality is futile and that he should be satisfied with the pleasures of this world. However, when she can’t turn him away from his purpose, she directs him to Urshanabi, the ferryman. Urshanabi takes Gilgamesh on the boat journey across the sea and through the Waters of Death to Utnapishtim. Utnapishtim tells Gilgamesh the story of the flood—how the gods met in council and decided to destroy humankind. Ea, the god of wisdom, warned Utnapishtim about the gods’ plans and told him how to fashion a gigantic boat in which his family and the seed of every living creature might escape. When the waters finally receded, the gods regretted what they’d done and agreed that they would never try to destroy humankind again. Utnapishtim was rewarded with eternal life. Men would die, but humankind would continue. 
When Gilgamesh insists that he be allowed to live forever, Utnapishtim gives him a test. If you think you can stay alive for eternity, he says, surely you can stay awake for a week. Gilgamesh tries and immediately fails. So Utnapishtim orders him to clean himself up, put on his royal garments again, and return to Uruk where he belongs. Just as Gilgamesh is departing, however, Utnapishtim’s wife convinces him to tell Gilgamesh about a miraculous plant that restores youth. Gilgamesh finds the plant and takes it with him, planning to share it with the elders of Uruk. But a snake steals the plant one night while they are camping. As the serpent slithers away, it sheds its skin and becomes young again. 
When Gilgamesh returns to Uruk, he is empty-handed but reconciled at last to his mortality. He knows that he can’t live forever but that humankind will. Now he sees that the city he had repudiated in his grief and terror is a magnificent, enduring achievement—the closest thing to immortality to which a mortal can aspire."
Kindred,"On June 9, 1976, it is the twenty-sixth birthday of Dana, a young Black woman. She and Kevin Franklin, her white husband, move into their new apartment in Southern California. Dana does the majority of the unpacking and settling in; Kevin focuses on his office and then stops helping. Dana gets dizzy, and her surroundings fade away. When she comes to, she finds herself in the early 1800s in Maryland. A young white boy named Rufus is struggling in a river. Dana wades in after him, but he is unconscious by the time she reaches him. She drags him to the shore and resuscitates him. Tom Weylin, Rufus’s father, arrives and points a gun at Dana, terrifying her. Following another dizzy spell, she reappears in her apartment in 1976.
Several minutes later, Dana again gets dizzy and disappears. This time, she is whisked back to 1815. Rufus, now a few years older, watches in horror as his bedroom drapes burn. He had set fire to them because he was angry with his father for selling a horse he wanted. Dana puts out the fire, talks to Rufus, and escapes from the house before Weylin finds out she is there. She runs to the home of Alice Greenwood and her mother, free Balck people who Dana suspects may be her ancestors. A group of young white men smash down the Greenwoods’ door, drag out Alice’s husband, who is a slave, and beat him. They also beat Alice’s mother. After the men leave, Dana comes out of hiding and helps Alice’s mother. Dana steps outside, and a returning white man finds her, beats her, and attempts to rape her. Dana fears for her life. Following another dizzy spell, she returns home to her own time.
The next time Dana time travels, Kevin comes with her by holding onto her. Back at the Weylins’, Rufus has fallen out of a tree and broken his leg. Nigel, a young Black boy, runs for help, and Weylin comes with his slave, Luke. Rufus will not let Dana leave, so everyone returns to the house together. Kevin and Dana stay on the plantation for several weeks and help educate Rufus. But when Dana gets caught teaching Nigel to read, Weylin whips her. Dana returns to 1976, but Kevin does not arrive in time to go with her.
After eight days at home, Dana time travels back and finds that Kevin has left the Maryland area and that Rufus has raped Alice Greenwood. Alice’s husband, Isaac, a slave, is beating Rufus badly. Dana convinces Isaac not to kill Rufus, and Alice and Isaac run away while Dana gets Rufus home. She stays in Maryland for two months. Although Rufus lies about how he got injured, Alice and Isaac are caught, and Alice is beaten and ravaged by dogs. As punishment for helping Isaac escape, Alice is made a slave. Rufus, who is in love with Alice, buys her. He forces Dana to convince Alice to sleep with him after her body has recovered. After Rufus fails to mail her letters to Kevin, Dana attempts to run away. As a result, she receives a vicious whipping, which so hurts and frightens her that she loses the will to run away again. Kevin shows up, as Weylin had written to him, and the couple attempts to escape. Rufus catches them on the road and shoots at them, but they manage to time travel together back to the 1970s.
After a few days, Dana time travels by herself back to Maryland and finds Rufus very drunk and lying facedown in a puddle. Weylin refuses to get a doctor. Over the course of many days, Dana nurses Rufus back to health. Rufus remains weak for weeks. Weylin has a heart attack, and Dana is unable to save him. Rufus blames her for his father’s death and forces her to work in the fields until she collapses.
Rufus is much harsher with Alice than he is with Dana. Alice is jealous of the kindness with which Rufus treats Dana. Alice gives birth to her second child with Rufus, Hagar, who is Dana’s direct ancestor. She tells Dana that she plans to run away as soon as she can. She fears that she is getting too used to Rufus, that she doesn’t hate him enough anymore. Weylin’s wife, Margaret, returns. Dana is forced to care for her. Rufus sells off some slaves, including Tess, his father’s former consort. He also sells Sam, a field hand, as punishment for flirting with Dana. When Dana tries to interfere, Rufus hits her. She slits her wrists in an effort to time travel and is successful.
Dana is back at home for many days. She and Kevin quarrel a little about Rufus. Kevin is jealous of his relationship with Dana, which Dana finds ridiculous. When Dana returns to the plantation, she finds that Alice has attempted to run away. To retaliate, Rufus told her that he sold her children, although actually he only sent them off to live with his aunt in Baltimore. Alice is sick with grief and eventually kills herself. Racked with guilt and anger about Alice’s death, Rufus nearly kills himself. He keeps Dana at his side almost constantly. One day, he tells her that she is so like Alice he cannot stand it. He catches her by the wrists, and Dana struggles free. She goes to the attic, planning to slit her wrists in order to get home, but Rufus follows her and attempts to rape her. Dana stabs him twice with her knife, killing him. She returns home immediately. Her arm is severed and crushed in the spot where Rufus was holding it."
Gaul,"All Quiet on the Western Front is narrated by Paul Bäumer, a young man of nineteen who fights in the German army on the French front in World War I. Paul and several of his friends from school joined the army voluntarily after listening to the stirring patriotic speeches of their teacher, Kantorek. But after experiencing ten weeks of brutal training at the hands of the petty, cruel Corporal Himmelstoss and the unimaginable brutality of life on the front, Paul and his friends have realized that the ideals of nationalism and patriotism for which they enlisted are simply empty clichés. They no longer believe that war is glorious or honorable, and they live in constant physical terror.
When Paul’s company receives a short reprieve after two weeks of fighting, only eighty men of the original 150-man company return from the front. The cook doesn’t want to give the survivors the rations that were meant for the dead men but eventually agrees to do so; the men thus enjoy a large meal. Paul and his friends visit Kemmerich, a former classmate who has recently had a leg amputated after contracting gangrene. Kemmerich is slowly dying, and Müller, another former classmate, wants Kemmerich’s boots for himself. Paul doesn’t consider Müller insensitive; like the other soldiers, Müller simply realizes pragmatically that Kemmerich no longer needs his boots. Surviving the agony of war, Paul observes, forces one to learn to disconnect oneself from emotions like grief, sympathy, and fear. Not long after this encounter, Paul returns to Kemmerich’s bedside just as the young man dies. At Kemmerich’s request, Paul takes his boots to Müller.
A group of new recruits comes to reinforce the company, and Paul’s friend Kat produces a beef and bean stew that impresses them. Kat says that if all the men in an army, including the officers, were paid the same wage and given the same food, wars would be over immediately. Kropp, another of Paul’s former classmates, says that there should be no armies; he argues that a nation’s leaders should instead fight out their disagreements with clubs. They discuss the fact that petty, insignificant people become powerful and arrogant during war, and Tjaden, a member of Paul’s company, announces that the cruel Corporal Himmelstoss has come to fight at the front.
At night, the men go on a harrowing mission to lay barbed wire at the front. Pounded by artillery, they hide in a graveyard, where the force of the shelling causes the buried corpses to emerge from their graves, as groups of living men fall dead around them. After this gruesome event, the surviving soldiers return to their camp, where they kill lice and think about what they will do at the end of the war. Some of the men have tentative plans, but all of them seem to feel that the war will never end. Paul fears that if the war did end, he wouldn’t know what to do with himself. Himmelstoss arrives at the front; when the men see him, Tjaden insults him. The men’s lieutenant gives them light punishment but also lectures Himmelstoss about the futility of saluting at the front. Paul and Kat find a house with a goose and roast the goose for supper, enjoying a rare good meal.
The company is caught in a bloody battle with a charging group of Allied infantrymen. Men are blown apart, limbs are severed from torsos, and giant rats pick at the dead and the wounded. Paul feels that he must become an animal in battle, trusting only his instincts to keep him alive. After the battle, only thirty-two of eighty men are still alive. The men are given a short reprieve at a field depot. Paul and some of his friends go for a swim, which ends in a rendezvous with a group of French girls. Paul desperately wishes to recapture his innocence with a girl, but he feels that it is impossible to do so.
Paul receives seventeen days of leave and goes home to see his family. He feels awkward and oppressed in his hometown, unable to discuss his traumatic experiences with anyone. He learns that his mother is dying of cancer and that Kantorek has been conscripted as a soldier, from which he derives a certain cold satisfaction. He visits Kemmerich’s mother and tells her, untruthfully, that her son’s death was instant and painless. At the end of his leave, Paul spends some time at a training camp near a group of Russian prisoners-of-war. Paul feels that the Russians are people just like him, not subhuman enemies, and wonders how war can make enemies of people who have no grudge against one another.
Paul is sent back to his company and is reunited with his friends. The kaiser, the German emperor, pays a visit to the front, and the men are disappointed to see that he is merely a short man with a weak voice. In battle, Paul is separated from his company and forced to hide in a shell hole. A French soldier jumps into the shell hole with him, and Paul instinctively stabs him. As the man dies a slow, painful death, Paul is overcome with remorse for having hurt him. He feels again that this enemy soldier is no enemy at all but rather a victim of war just like himself. Paul looks through the soldier’s things and finds that his name was Gérard Duval and learns that Duval had a wife and child at home. When he returns to his company, Paul recounts the incident to his friends, who try to console him.
Paul and his friends are given an easy assignment: for three weeks, they are to guard a supply depot away from the fighting. When the next battle takes place, Paul and Kropp are wounded and forced to bribe a sergeant-major with cigars in order to be placed on the hospital train together. At the hospital, Paul undergoes surgery. Kropp’s leg is amputated, and he becomes extremely depressed. After his surgery, Paul has a short leave at home before he returns to his company.
As the German army begins to give in to the unrelenting pressure of the Allied forces, Paul’s friends are killed in combat one by one. Detering, one of Paul’s close friends, attempts to desert but is caught and court-martialed. Kat is killed when a piece of shrapnel slices his head open while Paul is carrying him to safety. By the fall of 1918, Paul is the only one of his circle of friends who is still alive. Soldiers everywhere whisper that the Germans will soon surrender and that peace will come. Paul is poisoned in a gas attack and given a short leave. He reflects that, when the war ends, he will be ruined for peacetime; all he knows is the war. In October 1918, on a day with very little fighting, Paul is killed. The army report for that day reads simply: “All quiet on the Western Front.” Paul’s corpse wears a calm expression, as though relieved that the end has come at last."
Withered,"In the late winter months of 1801, a man named Lockwood rents a manor house called Thrushcross Grange in the isolated moor country of England. Here, he meets his dour landlord, Heathcliff, a wealthy man who lives in the ancient manor of Wuthering Heights, four miles away from the Grange. In this wild, stormy countryside, Lockwood asks his housekeeper, Nelly Dean, to tell him the story of Heathcliff and the strange denizens of Wuthering Heights. Nelly consents, and Lockwood writes down his recollections of her tale in his diary; these written recollections form the main part of Wuthering Heights.
Nelly remembers her childhood. As a young girl, she works as a servant at Wuthering Heights for the owner of the manor, Mr. Earnshaw, and his family. One day, Mr. Earnshaw goes to Liverpool and returns home with an orphan boy whom he will raise with his own children. At first, the Earnshaw children—a boy named Hindley and his younger sister Catherine—detest the dark-skinned Heathcliff. But Catherine quickly comes to love him, and the two soon grow inseparable, spending their days playing on the moors. After his wife’s death, Mr. Earnshaw grows to prefer Heathcliff to his own son, and when Hindley continues his cruelty to Heathcliff, Mr. Earnshaw sends Hindley away to college, keeping Heathcliff nearby.
Three years later, Mr. Earnshaw dies, and Hindley inherits Wuthering Heights. He returns with a wife, Frances, and immediately seeks revenge on Heathcliff. Once an orphan, later a pampered and favored son, Heathcliff now finds himself treated as a common laborer, forced to work in the fields. Heathcliff continues his close relationship with Catherine, however. One night they wander to Thrushcross Grange, hoping to tease Edgar and Isabella Linton, the cowardly, snobbish children who live there. Catherine is bitten by a dog and is forced to stay at the Grange to recuperate for five weeks, during which time Mrs. Linton works to make her a proper young lady. By the time Catherine returns, she has become infatuated with Edgar, and her relationship with Heathcliff grows more complicated.
When Frances dies after giving birth to a baby boy named Hareton, Hindley descends into the depths of alcoholism, and behaves even more cruelly and abusively toward Heathcliff. Eventually, Catherine’s desire for social advancement prompts her to become engaged to Edgar Linton, despite her overpowering love for Heathcliff. Heathcliff runs away from Wuthering Heights, staying away for three years, and returning shortly after Catherine and Edgar’s marriage.
When Heathcliff returns, he immediately sets about seeking revenge on all who have wronged him. Having come into a vast and mysterious wealth, he deviously lends money to the drunken Hindley, knowing that Hindley will increase his debts and fall into deeper despondency. When Hindley dies, Heathcliff inherits the manor. He also places himself in line to inherit Thrushcross Grange by marrying Isabella Linton, whom he treats very cruelly. Catherine becomes ill, gives birth to a daughter, and dies. Heathcliff begs her spirit to remain on Earth—she may take whatever form she will, she may haunt him, drive him mad—just as long as she does not leave him alone. Shortly thereafter, Isabella flees to London and gives birth to Heathcliff’s son, named Linton after her family. She keeps the boy with her there.
Thirteen years pass, during which Nelly Dean serves as Catherine’s daughter’s nursemaid at Thrushcross Grange. Young Cathy is beautiful and headstrong like her mother, but her temperament is modified by her father’s gentler influence. Cathy grows up at the Grange with no knowledge of Wuthering Heights; one day, however, wandering through the moors, she discovers the manor, meets Hareton, and plays together with him. Soon afterwards, Isabella dies, and Linton comes to live with Heathcliff. Heathcliff treats his sickly, whining son even more cruelly than he treated the boy’s mother.
Three years later, Cathy meets Heathcliff on the moors, and makes a visit to Wuthering Heights to meet Linton. She and Linton begin a secret romance conducted entirely through letters. When Nelly destroys Cathy's collection of letters, the girl begins sneaking out at night to spend time with her frail young lover, who asks her to come back and nurse him back to health. However, it quickly becomes apparent that Linton is pursuing Cathy only because Heathcliff is forcing him to; Heathcliff hopes that if Cathy marries Linton, his legal claim upon Thrushcross Grange—and his revenge upon Edgar Linton—will be complete.
One day, as Edgar Linton grows ill and nears death, Heathcliff lures Nelly and Cathy back to Wuthering Heights, and holds them prisoner until Cathy marries Linton. Soon after the marriage, Edgar dies, and his death is quickly followed by the death of the sickly Linton. Heathcliff now controls both Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange. He forces Cathy to live at Wuthering Heights and act as a common servant, while he rents Thrushcross Grange to Lockwood.
Nelly’s story ends as she reaches the present. Lockwood, appalled, ends his tenancy at Thrushcross Grange and returns to London. However, six months later, he pays a visit to Nelly, and learns of further developments in the story. Although Cathy originally mocked Hareton’s ignorance and illiteracy (in an act of retribution, Heathcliff ended Hareton’s education after Hindley died), Cathy grows to love Hareton as they live together at Wuthering Heights. Heathcliff becomes more and more obsessed with the memory of the elder Catherine, to the extent that he begins speaking to her ghost. Everything he sees reminds him of her. Shortly after a night spent walking on the moors, Heathcliff dies. Hareton and Cathy inherit Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange, and they plan to be married on the next New Year’s Day. After hearing the end of the story, Lockwood goes to visit the graves of Catherine and Heathcliff.
Chronology
The story of Wuthering Heights is told through flashbacks recorded in diary entries, and events are often presented out of chronological order—Lockwood’s narrative takes place after Nelly’s narrative, for instance, but is interspersed with Nelly’s story in his journal. Nevertheless, the novel contains enough clues to enable an approximate reconstruction of its chronology, which was elaborately designed by Emily Brontë. For instance, Lockwood’s diary entries are recorded in the late months of 1801 and in September 1802; in 1801, Nelly tells Lockwood that she has lived at Thrushcross Grange for eighteen years, since Catherine’s marriage to Edgar, which must then have occurred in 1783.
We know that Catherine was engaged to Edgar for three years, and that Nelly was twenty-two when they were engaged, so the engagement must have taken place in 1780, and Nelly must have been born in 1758. Since Nelly is a few years older than Catherine, and since Lockwood comments that Heathcliff is about forty years old in 1801, it stands to reason that Heathcliff and Catherine were born around 1761, three years after Nelly. There are several other clues like this in the novel (such as Hareton’s birth, which occurs in June, 1778). The following chronology is based on those clues, and should closely approximate the timing of the novel’s important events. A “~” before a date indicates that it cannot be precisely determined from the evidence in the novel, but only closely estimated.
1500: The stone above the front door of Wuthering Heights, bearing the name of Hareton Earnshaw, is inscribed, possibly to mark the completion of the house.
1758: Nelly is born.

Executing,"In the midst of a raging war, a plane evacuating a group of schoolboys from Britain is shot down over a deserted tropical island. Two of the boys, Ralph and Piggy, discover a conch shell on the beach, and Piggy realizes it could be used as a horn to summon the other boys. Once assembled, the boys set about electing a leader and devising a way to be rescued. They choose Ralph as their leader, and Ralph appoints another boy, Jack, to be in charge of the boys who will hunt food for the entire group.
Ralph, Jack, and another boy, Simon, set off on an expedition to explore the island. When they return, Ralph declares that they must light a signal fire to attract the attention of passing ships. The boys succeed in igniting some dead wood by focusing sunlight through the lenses of Piggy’s eyeglasses. However, the boys pay more attention to playing than to monitoring the fire, and the flames quickly engulf the forest. A large swath of dead wood burns out of control, and one of the youngest boys in the group disappears, presumably having burned to death.
At first, the boys enjoy their life without grown-ups and spend much of their time splashing in the water and playing games. Ralph, however, complains that they should be maintaining the signal fire and building huts for shelter. The hunters fail in their attempt to catch a wild pig, but their leader, Jack, becomes increasingly preoccupied with the act of hunting.
When a ship passes by on the horizon one day, Ralph and Piggy notice, to their horror, that the signal fire—which had been the hunters’ responsibility to maintain—has burned out. Furious, Ralph accosts Jack, but the hunter has just returned with his first kill, and all the hunters seem gripped with a strange frenzy, reenacting the chase in a kind of wild dance. Piggy criticizes Jack, who hits Piggy across the face. Ralph blows the conch shell and reprimands the boys in a speech intended to restore order. At the meeting, it quickly becomes clear that some of the boys have started to become afraid. The littlest boys, known as “littluns,” have been troubled by nightmares from the beginning, and more and more boys now believe that there is some sort of beast or monster lurking on the island. The older boys try to convince the others at the meeting to think rationally, asking where such a monster could possibly hide during the daytime. One of the littluns suggests that it hides in the sea—a proposition that terrifies the entire group.
Not long after the meeting, some military planes engage in a battle high above the island. The boys, asleep below, do not notice the flashing lights and explosions in the clouds. A parachutist drifts to earth on the signal-fire mountain, dead. Sam and Eric, the twins responsible for watching the fire at night, are asleep and do not see the parachutist land. When the twins wake up, they see the enormous silhouette of his parachute and hear the strange flapping noises it makes. Thinking the island beast is at hand, they rush back to the camp in terror and report that the beast has attacked them.
The boys organize a hunting expedition to search for the monster. Jack and Ralph, who are increasingly at odds, travel up the mountain. They see the silhouette of the parachute from a distance and think that it looks like a huge, deformed ape. The group holds a meeting at which Jack and Ralph tell the others of the sighting. Jack says that Ralph is a coward and that he should be removed from office, but the other boys refuse to vote Ralph out of power. Jack angrily runs away down the beach, calling all the hunters to join him. Ralph rallies the remaining boys to build a new signal fire, this time on the beach rather than on the mountain. They obey, but before they have finished the task, most of them have slipped away to join Jack.
Jack declares himself the leader of the new tribe of hunters and organizes a hunt and a violent, ritual slaughter of a sow to solemnize the occasion. The hunters then decapitate the sow and place its head on a sharpened stake in the jungle as an offering to the beast. Later, encountering the bloody, fly-covered head, Simon has a terrible vision, during which it seems to him that the head is speaking. The voice, which he imagines as belonging to the Lord of the Flies, says that Simon will never escape him, for he exists within all men. Simon faints. When he wakes up, he goes to the mountain, where he sees the dead parachutist. Understanding then that the beast does not exist externally but rather within each individual boy, Simon travels to the beach to tell the others what he has seen. But the others are in the midst of a chaotic revelry—even Ralph and Piggy have joined Jack’s feast—and when they see Simon’s shadowy figure emerge from the jungle, they fall upon him and kill him with their bare hands and teeth.
The following morning, Ralph and Piggy discuss what they have done. Jack’s hunters attack them and their few followers and steal Piggy’s glasses in the process. Ralph’s group travels to Jack’s stronghold in an attempt to make Jack see reason, but Jack orders Sam and Eric tied up and fights with Ralph. In the ensuing battle, one boy, Roger, rolls a boulder down the mountain, killing Piggy and shattering the conch shell. Ralph barely manages to escape a torrent of spears.
Ralph hides for the rest of the night and the following day, while the others hunt him like an animal. Jack has the other boys ignite the forest in order to smoke Ralph out of his hiding place. Ralph stays in the forest, where he discovers and destroys the sow’s head, but eventually, he is forced out onto the beach, where he knows the other boys will soon arrive to kill him. Ralph collapses in exhaustion, but when he looks up, he sees a British naval officer standing over him. The officer’s ship noticed the fire raging in the jungle. The other boys reach the beach and stop in their tracks at the sight of the officer. Amazed at the spectacle of this group of bloodthirsty, savage children, the officer asks Ralph to explain. Ralph is overwhelmed by the knowledge that he is safe but, thinking about what has happened on the island, he begins to weep. The other boys begin to sob as well. The officer turns his back so that the boys may regain their composure."
Mandates,"The narrator, Frank McCourt, describes how his parents meet in Brooklyn, New York. After his mother, Angela, becomes pregnant with Frank, she marries Malachy, the father of her child. Angela struggles to feed her growing family of sons, while Malachy spends his wages on alcohol. Frank’s much-loved baby sister, Margaret, dies and Angela falls into depression. The McCourts decide to return to Ireland. More troubles plague the McCourts in Ireland: Angela has a miscarriage, Frank’s two younger brothers die, and Malachy continues to drink away the family’s money.
	Frank’s childhood is described as a time of great deprivation, but of good humor and adventure as well. When the first floor of the house floods during the winter, Angela and Malachy announce that the family will leave the cold damp of the first floor, which they call “Ireland,” and move to the warm, cozy second floor, which they call “Italy.” Although Malachy’s alcoholism uses up all of the money for food, he earns Frank’s love and affection by entertaining him with stories about Irish heroes and the people who live on their lane.
	Over the course of a few years, Angela gives birth to two sons, Michael and Alphonsus. Alphosus is called “Alphie” for short. As Frank grows older, the narration increasingly focuses on his exploits at school. When Frank turns ten, he is confirmed (Confirmation is a ritual that makes one an official Christian or Catholic. When Frank was growing up, people were confirmed around ages seven to ten). Right after his confirmation, Frank falls ill with typhoid fever and must stay in the hospital for months. There, he gets his first introduction to Shakespeare. Frank finds comfort in stories of all kinds, from Shakespeare to movies to newspapers. By the time he returns to school, his gift for language is obvious. In particular, Frank’s flair for storytelling gets him noticed by his teacher.
	With the onset of World War II, many fathers in Limerick go to England to find work and send money back to their families. Eventually, Malachy goes as well, but he fails to send money home. Frank begins to work for Mr. Hannon. This is the first in a series of jobs. Frank will go on to work for Mr. Timoney, Uncle Ab, the post office, Mrs. Finucane, and Mr. McCaffrey. Frank enjoys the feeling of responsibility he gets from working, and he dreams of saving enough to provide his family with food and clothes.
	The McCourts get evicted from their lodgings and must move in with Angela’s cousin Laman. Angela begins sleeping with Laman, an arrangement that makes Frank increasingly uncomfortable and angry. He also begins to feel guilty about his own sexual feelings. The priests’ strict mandates against masturbation make Frank feel guilty when he masturbates.
	While working as a messenger boy, Frank begins a sexual relationship with a customer, Theresa Carmody, who eventually dies of consumption, leaving Frank heartbroken. Frank saves enough money to get to New York. On his first night there, he attends a party and sleeps with an American woman. Though sad to leave behind Ireland and his family, Frank has great expectations for the future."
Kinds,"Jing-mei’s mother lost everyone she loved before fleeing China and coming to the United States in search of the American Dream. Her heavy hopes rest solely on the back of her daughter who she believes could be a prodigy if she tries. Initially, mother and daughter share the goal of Jing-mei’s success, and they dream up ways for her to become famous like child actress Shirley Temple. When her mother takes Jing-mei to get her hair done in the fashion of Temple’s famous curls, the makeover is botched, and Jing-mei ends up with a Peter Pan haircut. Her mother projects her disappointment onto her daughter and makes Jing-mei feel like her mangled hair is somehow her own fault. Soon, Jing-mei starts to feel the weight of her mother’s unattainable expectations. She is subjected to nightly aptitude tests inspired by stories of amazing children featured in magazines her mother procures from the houses she cleans. Jing-mei is forced to perform magic tricks, predict the weather, memorize capitals, stand on her head, and more, but with each failed attempt her mother’s face registers disappointment. When Jing-mei looks in the mirror, she doesn’t see herself anymore. Instead, she sees an ordinary, sad, ugly girl.
From then on, Jing-mei is determined to defy her mother’s expectations in order to maintain her own identity. Jing-mei refuses to show interest in her mother’s tests so that her mother will lose hope, and for a little while, she is successful. Then the sight of a Chinese girl playing piano on TV reignites Jing-mei’s mother’s hope. Jing-mei sees the girl as a Chinese Shirley Temple who mirrors the prodigy self she once dreamed of becoming. When her mother critiques the girl’s skill, Jing-mei defends her and protests that at least she is trying. Her mother retorts that Jing-mei could be good at anything but she doesn’t try. To Jing-mei’s dismay, her mother arranges piano lessons with their neighbor, Mr. Chong, in exchange for housecleaning services. Jing-mei cries that she isn’t a genius and accuses her mother of trying to make her into something she isn’t. In response, her mother slaps her and says that she doesn’t want Jing-mei to be a genius; she only wants her to be her best.
Jing-mei quickly realizes that Mr. Chong, nicknamed “Old Chong,” is deaf and has poor sight. He cannot hear the music she plays, and his eyes cannot keep up with her fingers on the keys. She tricks him into thinking she is playing the right notes and therefore finds out how many mistakes she can get away with while being lazy. Although she finds that she has a natural ability for playing the piano, Jing-mei is determined to defy her mother and continue her ruse of attempting to be skillful. A year later, Jing-mei hears Auntie Lindo bragging about her daughter, Waverly, the youngest chess champion in Chinatown. Not to be outdone, Jing-mei’s mother brags about her daughter’s natural talent for the piano even though she hasn’t heard her play. This enrages Jing-mei, and she decides she is going to put an end to her mother’s silly pride. 
Although they are of meager means, Jing-mei’s parents save up their money to buy a secondhand piano for their living room. Then Old Chong and Jing-mei’s mother sign Jing-mei up for the church talent show in order to show off her skill. The piece she is to play in the talent show is called “Pleading Child” and is not particularly difficult. Instead of memorizing the piece, though, Jing-mei daydreams and practices her curtsy to the audience. Jing-mei’s mother invites all of her family and friends to the talent show. Jing-mei is excited and confident that her inner prodigy will emerge and she will play flawlessly. However, when she starts to play, she is shocked by the sounds of wrong notes, and a chill runs through her. When she finishes, she is shaken but hopes that somehow she has only imagined playing incorrect notes. She curtsies, but the audience is silent except for Old Chong’s cheers. Jing-mei feels shame and humiliation, and she can sense these feelings in her parents as well. Instead of leaving, they sit through the rest of the show without speaking a word. Jing-mei hears a child comment that her performance was terrible, and the child’s mother remarks that at least she tried. Jing-mei, however, knows this isn’t true.  
Afterward, the blank look on her mother’s face devastates Jing-mei. Rather than scolding Jing-mei, her mother rides home in silence and shuts herself in her room. Jing-mei is disappointed by her mother’s composed reaction. She’d hoped for the chance to scream at her mother and blame her for her unhappiness. Two days later, to Jing-mei’s surprise, her mother demands she practice again. Her mother drags her to the piano as Jing-mei screams that she will never be the child her mother wanted. Jing-mei’s mother responds that there are only two kinds of daughters: those who are obedient and those who do what they want. She makes it clear that Jing-mei will be the obedient daughter as long as she lives under her roof. Jing-mei boils over and tells her mother that she wishes she was dead like the twins her mother lost in China. This statement breaks her mother, and she silently walks away. She never forces Jing-mei to play the piano again. 
As the years go by and Jing-mei grows up, she counts all the ways she has been a disappointment to her mother and has failed in order to assert control of her own life. The piano remains in her parents’ living room but is never played, and Jing-mei and her mother never speak about the incident again. As an adult, Jing-mei also wonders why her mother ultimately gave up hope. Then, on Jing-mei’s thirtieth birthday, her mother offers her the piano. Jing-mei feels forgiveness and redemption at the offer, but she doesn’t take it. When Jing-mei’s mother dies, Jing-mei goes to her parents’ apartment to handle her possessions for her father. She has the piano reconditioned and searches through her old music books. There, she finds the recital song “Pleading Child” and begins to play it again. On the opposite page, she discovers a song she hadn’t noticed before titled “Perfectly Contented.” She plays both songs, noting their similarities and differences as she finally realizes that they are two halves of the same song."
Lay,"Addie Bundren, the wife of Anse Bundren and the matriarch of a poor Southern family, is very ill, and is expected to die soon. Her oldest son, Cash, puts all of his carpentry skills into preparing her coffin, which he builds right in front of Addie’s bedroom window. Although Addie’s health is failing rapidly, two of her other sons, Darl and Jewel, leave town to make a delivery for the Bundrens’ neighbor, Vernon Tull, whose wife and two daughters have been tending to Addie. Shortly after Darl and Jewel leave, Addie dies. The youngest Bundren child, Vardaman, associates his mother’s death with that of a fish he caught and cleaned earlier that day. With some help, Cash completes the coffin just before dawn. Vardaman is troubled by the fact that his mother is nailed shut inside a box, and while the others sleep, he bores holes in the lid, two of which go through his mother’s face. Addie and Anse’s daughter, Dewey Dell, whose recent sexual liaisons with a local farmhand named Lafe have left her pregnant, is so overwhelmed by anxiety over her condition that she barely mourns her mother’s death. A funeral service is held on the following day, where the women sing songs inside the Bundren house while the men stand outside on the porch talking to each other.
Darl, who narrates much of this first section, returns with Jewel a few days later, and the presence of buzzards over their house lets them know their mother is dead. On seeing this sign, Darl sardonically reassures Jewel, who is widely perceived as ungrateful and uncaring, that he can be sure his beloved horse is not dead. Addie has made Anse promise that she will be buried in the town of Jefferson, and though this request is a far more complicated proposition than burying her at home, Anse’s sense of obligation, combined with his desire to buy a set of false teeth, compels him to fulfill Addie’s dying wish. Cash, who has broken his leg on a job site, helps the family lift the unbalanced coffin, but it is Jewel who ends up manhandling it, almost single-handedly, into the wagon. Jewel refuses, however, to actually come in the wagon, and follows the rest of the family riding on his horse, which he bought when he was young by secretly working nights on a neighbor’s land.
On the first night of their journey, the Bundrens stay at the home of a generous local family, who regards the Bundrens’ mission with skepticism. Due to severe flooding, the main bridges leading over the local river have been flooded or washed away, and the Bundrens are forced to turn around and attempt a river-crossing over a makeshift ford. When a stray log upsets the wagon, the coffin is knocked out, Cash’s broken leg is reinjured, and the team of mules drowns. Vernon Tull sees the wreck, and helps Jewel rescue the coffin and the wagon from the river. Together, the family members and Tull search the riverbed for Cash’s tools.
Cora, Tull’s wife, remembers Addie’s unchristian inclination to respect her son Jewel more than God. Addie herself, speaking either from her coffin or in a leap back in time to her deathbed, recalls events from her life: her loveless marriage to Anse; her affair with the local minister, Whitfield, which led to Jewel’s conception; and the birth of her various children. Whitfield recalls traveling to the Bundrens’ house to confess the affair to Anse, and his eventual decision not to say anything after all.
A horse doctor sets Cash’s broken leg, while Cash faints from the pain without ever complaining. Anse is able to purchase a new team of mules by mortgaging his farm equipment, using money that he was saving for his false teeth and money that Cash was saving for a new gramophone, and trading in Jewel’s horse. The family continues on its way. In the town of Mottson, residents react with horror to the stench coming from the Bundren wagon. While the family is in town, Dewey Dell tries to buy a drug that will abort her unwanted pregnancy, but the pharmacist refuses to sell it to her, and advises marriage instead. With cement the family has purchased in town, Darl creates a makeshift cast for Cash’s broken leg, which fits poorly and only increases Cash’s pain. The Bundrens then spend the night at a local farm owned by a man named Gillespie. Darl, who has been skeptical of their mission for some time, burns down the Gillespie barn with the intention of incinerating the coffin and Addie’s rotting corpse. Jewel rescues the animals in the barn, then risks his life to drag out Addie’s coffin. Darl lies on his mother’s coffin and cries.
The next day, the Bundrens arrive in Jefferson and bury Addie. Rather than face a lawsuit for Darl’s criminal barn burning, the Bundrens claim that Darl is insane, and give him to a pair of men who commit him to a Jackson mental institution. Dewey Dell tries again to buy an abortion drug at the local pharmacy, where a boy working behind the counter claims to be a doctor and tricks her into exchanging sexual services for what she soon realizes is not an actual abortion drug. The following morning, the children are greeted by their father, who sports a new set of false teeth and, with a mixture of shame and pride, introduces them to his new bride, a local woman he meets while borrowing shovels with which to bury Addie."
Applies,"The Other Wes Moore: One Name, Two Fates tells the story of two Black men with the same name: Wes Moore. Both men grew up enduring similar hardships, but Moore, the author and narrator, was encouraged to overcome these difficulties and became successful, while Wes, his counterpart, found himself sentenced to life in prison for murder. Moore learns about Wes and, fascinated, writes him a letter, hoping to find out more about what led Wes to a life of incarceration. Moore receives a response from Wes and begins to visit him in prison, where the two share their stories.
In the first section of the book, the two men discuss the impact that the absence of their fathers had on their lives, and their stories alternate in each chapter. Moore introduces his mother, Joy; father, Westley; and sisters, Nikki and Shani. He details how his parents met and describes his father’s job as a radio journalist. When Moore was three years old, he watched his father become sick and die in front of him. 
Meanwhile, young Wes has never met his father, Bernard, who was an alcoholic, but loved spending time with his father’s mother, Mamie. One day, Wes’s mother, Mary, learns that her funding to go to college has been taken away, and her dream to get her degree crumbles. That night, Mary has plans with friends, so she drops young Wes off at Mamie’s for the night. When Wes arrives at Mamie’s, he sees a drunk man—Bernard—on Mamie’s couch. When Bernard asks Mary who the kid is, Mary introduces Wes to his father.
Several years later, Wes and his friend Woody go the park, where they meet up with a group of boys to play football. The game turns aggressive, and another boy punches Wes. Wes runs home and grabs a knife. He returns to the park and runs after the boy, but the police arrive and arrest Wes. He is eight years old. 
Around this time, Moore’s widowed mother, Joy, unable to raise her children alone any longer, has moved her family to the Bronx to live with her parents. To keep Moore off the street, she sends Moore to Riverdale, a private school. She works three jobs to pay the tuition. Moore feels alienated. He doesn’t fit in at Riverdale, and the neighborhood kids tease him for attending a white school. When Moore’s grades slip, Joy threatens to send him to military school. 
Wes admires and envies his older brother Tony. Tony is very protective of Wes. Tony deals drugs, has a formidable reputation, and always seems to wear expensive, stylish clothes. Hoping to earn money like Tony, Wes becomes a lookout for a local drug dealer. He later starts dealing drugs himself.
In the next section of the book, Moore and Wes discuss maturity and second chances. Once again, their stories alternate in each chapter. At age fifteen, Wes makes his money selling drugs. When Tony asks Wes how he can afford so many pairs of sneakers, Wes lies and says he works as a DJ. Tony knows he’s being dishonest, attacks him, and then tells Mary that Wes sells drugs. Mary finds drugs in Wes’s room and flushes them down the toilet. Wes feels angry about the situation but vows to make up the $4,000 he lost. 
In the Bronx, Moore continues to do poorly in school. The police catch him tagging a building with his friend Shea, who has started running drugs. Shea is obstinate toward the police, but Moore feels terrified. The police let the boys off with a warning. A year later, Moore finds himself on academic probation at Riverdale, so Joy sends him to military school. At first, Moore displays an attitude and defies his commander, Sergeant Anderson. At one point, Anderson gives Moore a map with directions to the nearest bus station, encouraging Moore to leave. The directions are fake, however, and Moore becomes lost in the woods. When Anderson finds Moore in the woods, he brings him to Colonel Batt, who allows Moore to call home for five minutes. The next day, Moore is impressed by the discipline of F Company, and Colonel Batt suggests he talks to its commander, Cadet Captain Ty Hill.
In Maryland, Wes meets Alicia, who quickly becomes pregnant. Wes soon begins dating a new girl, however, and one night, as the girl leaves Wes’s apartment, her boyfriend, Ray, is waiting outside. Ray yells at the girl and attacks Wes, who runs inside and grabs a gun. Wes and some of his crew chase Ray and shoot him. Wes is arrested soon after. He spends six months in juvenile detention for the crime.
Three years later, Wes has dropped out of school and is selling drugs full-time. One day, a suspicious man approaches Wes, asking for drugs. Wes turns the man away at first but then decides to take a chance. However, the man is an undercover cop, and Wes is arrested again. 
Meanwhile, Moore thrives in military school, where he wins academic and athletic scholarships. One day, Moore and a friend walk into town for food. While they are walking, a group of boys in a car accost them, shout racial slurs, and hit Moore in the head with a bottle. Moore and his friend find their way back to campus through the same woods where Moore once got lost. He reflects on how much has changed for him over the past few years.
In the third section of the book, Moore and Wes discuss how other people’s expectations have shaped their lives. While in a plane during his paratrooper training, Moore contemplates how much his life has changed and considers how he now sees every moment of life as precious. 
In Baltimore, Wes, now the father of four, tries to change his life and goes to Job Corps for vocational training. There, he is encouraged by his teachers and peers and finds success. However, after graduating, Wes struggles to pay his bills and turns to selling drugs again.
Three years later, Wes and Tony rob a jewelry store. As they escape, one of them shoots and kills the security guard, Sergeant Prothero. The police find and arrest them in Philadelphia. Tony pleads guilty and receives a life sentence. Wes pleads innocent and goes to trial, where he is convicted and also sentenced to life in prison. 
During this time, Moore works as an intern for Baltimore’s Mayor Schmoke, who encourages Moore to apply for a Rhodes Scholarship. Moore receives a grant and spends a semester in South Africa, where he witnesses true poverty and the impact of apartheid. At the same time, Moore learns how young Black men in South Africa are encouraged and celebrated, rather than feared, and decides to dedicate himself to a life of service."
Resulting,"The protagonist, who is named Tim O’Brien, begins by describing an event that occurred in the middle of his Vietnam experience. “The Things They Carried” catalogs the variety of things his fellow soldiers in the Alpha Company brought on their missions. Several of these things are intangible, including guilt and fear, while others are specific physical objects, including matches, morphine, M-16 rifles, and M&M’s candy.
Throughout the collection, the same characters reappear in various stories. The first member of the Alpha Company to die is Ted Lavender, a “grunt,” or low-ranking soldier, who deals with his anxiety about the war by taking tranquilizers and smoking marijuana. Lavender is shot in the head on his way back from going to the bathroom, and his superior, Lieutenant Jimmy Cross, blames himself for the tragedy. When Lavender is shot, Cross is distracting himself with thoughts of Martha, a college crush. It is revealed in “Love” that Cross’s feelings for Martha, whom he dated once before leaving for Vietnam, were never reciprocated, and that even twenty years after the war, his guilt over Lavender’s death remains.
In “On the Rainy River,” the narrator, O’Brien, explains the series of events that led him to Vietnam in the first place. He receives his draft notice in June of 1968, and his feelings of confusion drive him north to the Canadian border, which he contemplates crossing so that he will not be forced to fight in a war in which he doesn’t believe. Sitting in a rowboat with the proprietor of the Tip Top Lodge, where he stays, O’Brien decides that his guilt about avoiding the war and fear of disappointing his family are more important than his political convictions. He soon leaves, going first back home to Worthington, Minnesota and later to Vietnam.
In addition to Ted Lavender, a few other members of the Alpha Company are killed during their mission overseas, including Curt Lemon, who is killed when he steps on a rigged mortar round. Though O’Brien is not close to Lemon, in “The Dentist,” he tells a story of how Lemon, who faints before a routine checkup with an army-issued dentist, tries to save face by insisting that a perfectly good tooth be pulled. Lee Strunk, another member of the company, dies from injuries he sustains by stepping on a landmine. In “Friends,” O’Brien remembers that before Strunk was fatally hurt, Strunk and Dave Jensen had made a pact that if either man were irreparably harmed, the other man would see that he was quickly killed. However, when Strunk is actually hurt, he begs Jensen to spare him, and Jensen complies. Instead of being upset by the news of his friend’s swift death en route to treatment, Jensen is relieved.
The death that receives the most attention in The Things They Carried is that of Kiowa, a much-loved member of the Alpha Company and one of O’Brien’s closest friends. In “Speaking of Courage,” the story of Kiowa’s death is relayed in retrospect through the memory of Norman Bowker, years after the war. As Bowker drives around a lake in his Iowa hometown, he thinks that he failed to save Kiowa, who was killed when a mortar round hit and caused him to sink headfirst into a marshy field. O’Brien realizes that he has dealt with his guilt over Kiowa’s death differently than Norman Bowker in “Notes.” Just before the end of the war, O’Brien receives a long letter from Bowker that says he hasn’t found a way to make life meaningful after the war. O’Brien resolves to tell Bowker’s story, and the story of Kiowa’s death, in order to negotiate his own feelings of guilt and hollowness.
Like “Love” and “Notes,” several of O’Brien’s stories are told from a perspective twenty years after the Vietnam War, when he is a forty-three-year-old writer living in Massachusetts. Exposure to the guilt of old friends like Jimmy Cross and Norman Bowker prompts him to write stories in order to understand what they were going through. But two stories, “The Man I Killed” and “Ambush,” are written so that O’Brien can confront his own guilt over killing a man with a grenade outside the village of My Khe. In “The Man I Killed,” O’Brien imagines the life of his victim, from his childhood to the way things would have turned out for him had O’Brien not spotted him on a path and thrown a grenade at his feet. In “Ambush,” O’Brien imagines how he might relay the story of the man he killed to his nine-year-old daughter, Kathleen. In this second story, O’Brien provides more details of the actual killing—including the sound of the grenade and his own feelings—and explains that even well after the fact, he hasn’t finished sorting out the experience.
In the last story, “The Lives of the Dead,” O’Brien gives another twist to his contention that stories have the power to save people. In the stories of Curt Lemon and Kiowa, O’Brien explains that his imagination allowed him to grapple successfully with his guilt and confusion over the death of his fourth-grade first love, Linda."
Awaken,"The Awakening opens in the late 1800s in Grand Isle, a summer holiday resort popular with the wealthy inhabitants of nearby New Orleans. Edna Pontellier is vacationing with her husband, Léonce, and their two sons at the cottages of Madame Lebrun, which house affluent Creoles from the French Quarter. Léonce is kind and loving but preoccupied with his work. His frequent business-related absences mar his domestic life with Edna. Consequently, Edna spends most of her time with her friend Adèle Ratignolle, a married Creole who epitomizes womanly elegance and charm. Through her relationship with Adèle, Edna learns a great deal about freedom of expression. Because Creole women were expected and assumed to be chaste, they could behave in a forthright and unreserved manner. Exposure to such openness liberates Edna from her previously prudish behavior and repressed emotions and desires.
Edna’s relationship with Adèle begins Edna’s process of “awakening” and self-discovery, which constitutes the focus of the book. The process accelerates as Edna comes to know Robert Lebrun, the elder, single son of Madame Lebrun. Robert is known among the Grand Isle vacationers as a man who chooses one woman each year—often a married woman—to whom he then plays “attendant” all summer long. This summer, he devotes himself to Edna, and the two spend their days together lounging and talking by the shore. Adèle Ratignolle often accompanies them.
At first, the relationship between Robert and Edna is innocent. They mostly bathe in the sea or engage in idle talk. As the summer progresses, however, Edna and Robert grow closer, and Robert’s affections and attention inspire in Edna several internal revelations. She feels more alive than ever before, and she starts to paint again as she did in her youth. She also learns to swim and becomes aware of her independence and sexuality. Edna and Robert never openly discuss their love for one another, but the time they spend alone together kindles memories in Edna of the dreams and desires of her youth. She becomes inexplicably depressed at night with her husband and profoundly joyful during her moments of freedom, whether alone or with Robert. Recognizing how intense the relationship between him and Edna has become, Robert honorably removes himself from Grand Isle to avoid consummating his forbidden love. Edna returns to New Orleans a changed woman.
Back in New Orleans, Edna actively pursues her painting and ignores all of her social responsibilities. Worried about the changing attitude and increasing disobedience of his wife, Léonce seeks the guidance of the family physician, Doctor Mandelet. A wise and enlightened man, Doctor Mandelet suspects that Edna’s transformation is the result of an affair, but he hides his suspicions from Léonce. Instead, Doctor Mandelet suggests that Léonce let Edna’s defiance run its course, since attempts to control her would only fuel her rebellion. Léonce heeds the doctor’s advice, allowing Edna to remain home alone while he is away on business. With her husband gone and her children away as well, Edna wholly rejects her former lifestyle. She moves into a home of her own and declares herself independent—the possession of no one. Her love for Robert still intense, Edna pursues an affair with the town seducer, Alcée Arobin, who is able to satisfy her sexual needs. Never emotionally attached to Arobin, Edna maintains control throughout their affair, satisfying her animalistic urges but retaining her freedom from male domination.
At this point, the self-sufficient and unconventional old pianist Mademoiselle Reisz adopts Edna as a sort of protégé, warning Edna of the sacrifices required of an artist. Edna is moved by Mademoiselle Reisz’s piano playing and visits her often. She is also eager to read the letters from abroad that Robert sends the woman. A woman who devotes her life entirely to her art, Mademoiselle serves as an inspiration and model to Edna, who continues her process of awakening and independence. Mademoiselle Reisz is the only person who knows of Robert and Edna’s secret love for one another and she encourages Edna to admit to, and act upon, her feelings.
Unable to stay away, Robert returns to New Orleans, finally expressing openly his feelings for Edna. He admits his love but reminds her that they cannot possibly be together, since she is the wife of another man. Edna explains to him her newly established independence, denying the rights of her husband over her and explaining how she and Robert can live together happily, ignoring everything extraneous to their relationship. But despite his love for Edna, Robert feels unable to enter into the adulterous affair.
When Adèle undergoes a difficult and dangerous childbirth, Edna leaves Robert’s arms to go to her friend. She pleads with him to wait for her return. From the time she spends with Edna, Adèle senses that Edna is becoming increasingly distant, and she understands that Edna’s relationship with Robert has intensified. She reminds Edna to think of her children and advocates the socially acceptable lifestyle Edna abandoned so long ago. Doctor Mandelet, while walking Edna home from Adèle’s, urges her to come see him because he is worried about the outcome of her passionate but confused actions. Already reeling under the weight of Adèle’s admonition, Edna begins to perceive herself as having acted selfishly.
Edna returns to her house to find Robert gone, a note of farewell left in his place. Robert’s inability to escape the ties of society now prompts Edna’s most devastating awakening. Haunted by thoughts of her children and realizing that she would have eventually found even Robert unable to fulfill her desires and dreams, Edna feels an overwhelming sense of solitude. Alone in a world in which she has found no feeling of belonging, she can find only one answer to the inescapable and heartbreaking limitations of society. She returns to Grand Isle, the site of her first moments of emotional, sexual, and intellectual awareness, and, in a final escape, gives herself to the sea. As she swims through the soft, embracing water, she thinks about her freedom from her husband and children, as well as Robert’s failure to understand her, Doctor Mandelet’s words of wisdom, and Mademoiselle Reisz’s courage. The text leaves open the question of whether the suicide constitutes a cowardly surrender or a liberating triumph."
Fashioning,"In a series of letters, Robert Walton, the captain of a ship bound for the North Pole, recounts to his sister back in England the progress of his dangerous mission. Successful early on, the mission is soon interrupted by seas full of impassable ice. Trapped, Walton encounters Victor Frankenstein, who has been traveling by dog-drawn sledge across the ice and is weakened by the cold. Walton takes him aboard ship, helps nurse him back to health, and hears the fantastic tale of the monster that Frankenstein created.
Victor first describes his early life in Geneva. At the end of a blissful childhood spent in the company of Elizabeth Lavenza (his cousin in the 1818 edition, his adopted sister in the 1831 edition) and friend Henry Clerval, Victor enters the university of Ingolstadt to study natural philosophy and chemistry. There, he is consumed by the desire to discover the secret of life and, after several years of research, becomes convinced that he has found it.
Armed with the knowledge he has long been seeking, Victor spends months feverishly fashioning a creature out of old body parts. One climactic night, in the secrecy of his apartment, he brings his creation to life. When he looks at the monstrosity that he has created, however, the sight horrifies him. After a fitful night of sleep, interrupted by the specter of the monster looming over him, he runs into the streets, eventually wandering in remorse. Victor runs into Henry, who has come to study at the university, and he takes his friend back to his apartment. Though the monster is gone, Victor falls into a feverish illness.
Sickened by his horrific deed, Victor prepares to return to Geneva, to his family, and to health. Just before departing Ingolstadt, however, he receives a letter from his father informing him that his youngest brother, William, has been murdered. Grief-stricken, Victor hurries home. While passing through the woods where William was strangled, he catches sight of the monster and becomes convinced that the monster is his brother’s murderer. Arriving in Geneva, Victor finds that Justine Moritz, a kind, gentle girl who had been adopted by the Frankenstein household, has been accused. She is tried, condemned, and executed, despite her assertions of innocence. Victor grows despondent, guilty with the knowledge that the monster he has created bears responsibility for the death of two innocent loved ones.
Hoping to ease his grief, Victor takes a vacation to the mountains. While he is alone one day, crossing an enormous glacier, the monster approaches him. The monster admits to the murder of William but begs for understanding. Lonely, shunned, and forlorn, he says that he struck out at William in a desperate attempt to injure Victor, his cruel creator. The monster begs Victor to create a mate for him, a monster equally grotesque to serve as his sole companion.
Victor refuses at first, horrified by the prospect of creating a second monster. The monster is eloquent and persuasive, however, and he eventually convinces Victor. After returning to Geneva, Victor heads for England, accompanied by Henry, to gather information for the creation of a female monster. Leaving Henry in Scotland, he secludes himself on a desolate island in the Orkneys and works reluctantly at repeating his first success. One night, struck by doubts about the morality of his actions, Victor glances out the window to see the monster glaring in at him with a frightening grin. Horrified by the possible consequences of his work, Victor destroys his new creation. The monster, enraged, vows revenge, swearing that he will be with Victor on Victor’s wedding night.
Later that night, Victor takes a boat out onto a lake and dumps the remains of the second creature in the water. The wind picks up and prevents him from returning to the island. In the morning, he finds himself ashore near an unknown town. Upon landing, he is arrested and informed that he will be tried for a murder discovered the previous night. Victor denies any knowledge of the murder, but when shown the body, he is shocked to behold his friend Henry Clerval, with the mark of the monster’s fingers on his neck. Victor falls ill, raving and feverish, and is kept in prison until his recovery, after which he is acquitted of the crime.
Shortly after returning to Geneva with his father, Victor marries Elizabeth. He fears the monster’s warning and suspects that he will be murdered on his wedding night. To be cautious, he sends Elizabeth away to wait for him. While he awaits the monster, he hears Elizabeth scream and realizes that the monster had been hinting at killing his new bride, not himself. Victor returns home to his father, who dies of grief a short time later. Victor vows to devote the rest of his life to finding the monster and exacting his revenge, and he soon departs to begin his quest.
Victor tracks the monster ever northward into the ice. In a dogsled chase, Victor almost catches up with the monster, but the sea beneath them swells and the ice breaks, leaving an unbridgeable gap between them. At this point, Walton encounters Victor, and the narrative catches up to the time of Walton’s fourth letter to his sister.
Walton tells the remainder of the story in another series of letters to his sister. Victor, already ill when the two men meet, worsens and dies shortly thereafter. When Walton returns, several days later, to the room in which the body lies, he is startled to see the monster weeping over Victor. The monster tells Walton of his immense solitude, suffering, hatred, and remorse. He asserts that now that his creator has died, he too can end his suffering. The monster then departs for the northernmost ice to die."
Matured,"In a series of vignettes, The House on Mango Street covers a year in the life of Esperanza, a Chicana (Mexican-American girl), who is about twelve years old when the novel begins. During the year, she moves with her family into a house on Mango Street. The house is a huge improvement from the family’s previous apartment, and it is the first home her parents actually own. However, the house is not what Esperanza has dreamed of, because it is run-down and small. The house is in the center of a crowded Latino neighborhood in Chicago, a city where many of the poor areas are racially segregated. Esperanza does not have any privacy, and she resolves that she will someday leave Mango Street and have a house all her own.
Esperanza matures significantly during the year, both sexually and emotionally. The novel charts her life as she makes friends, grows hips, develops her first crush, endures sexual assault, and begins to write as a way of expressing herself and as a way to escape the neighborhood. The novel also includes the stories of many of Esperanza’s neighbors, giving a full picture of the neighborhood and showing the many possible paths Esperanza may follow in the future.
After moving to the house, Esperanza quickly befriends Lucy and Rachel, two Chicana girls who live across the street. Lucy, Rachel, Esperanza, and Esperanza’s little sister, Nenny, have many adventures in the small space of their neighborhood. They buy a bike, learn exciting stories about boys from a young woman named Marin, explore a junk shop, and have intimate conversations while playing Double Dutch (jumping rope). The girls are on the brink of puberty and sometimes find themselves sexually vulnerable, such as when they walk around their neighborhood in high-heeled shoes or when Esperanza is kissed by an older man at her first job. During the first half of the year, the girls are content to live and play in their child’s world. At school, Esperanza feels ashamed about her family’s poverty and her difficult-to-pronounce name. She secretly writes poems that she shares only with older women she trusts.
Over the summer, Esperanza slips into puberty. She suddenly likes it when boys watch her dance, and she enjoys dreaming about them. Esperanza’s newfound sexual maturity, combined with the death of two of her family members, her grandfather and her Aunt Lupe, bring her closer to the world of adults. She begins to closely watch the women in her neighborhood. This second half of The House on Mango Street presents a string of stories about older women in the neighborhood, all of whom are even more stuck in their situations and, quite literally, in their houses, than Esperanza is. Meanwhile, during the beginning of the following school year, Esperanza befriends Sally, a girl her age who is more sexually mature than Lucy or Rachel. Sally, meanwhile, has her own agenda. She uses boys and men as an escape route from her abusive father. Esperanza is not completely comfortable with Sally’s sexual experience, and their friendship results in a crisis when Sally leaves Esperanza alone, and a group of boys sexually assaults Esperanza in her absence.
Esperanza’s traumatic experiences as Sally’s friend, in conjunction with her detailed observations of the older women in her neighborhood, cement her desire to escape Mango Street and to have her own house. When Esperanza finds herself emotionally ready to leave her neighborhood, however, she discovers that she will never fully be able to leave Mango Street behind, and that after she leaves she’ll have to return to help the women she has left. At the end of the year, Esperanza remains on Mango Street, but she has matured extensively. She has a stronger desire to leave and understands that writing will help her put distance between herself and her situation. Though for now writing helps her escape only emotionally, in the future it may help her to escape physically as well."
Striking,"During a New Year’s Eve feast at King Arthur’s court, a strange figure, referred to only as the Green Knight, pays the court an unexpected visit. He challenges the group’s leader or any other brave representative to a game. The Green Knight says that he will allow whomever accepts the challenge to strike him with his own axe, on the condition that the challenger find him in exactly one year to receive a blow in return.
Stunned, Arthur hesitates to respond, but when the Green Knight mocks Arthur’s silence, the king steps forward to take the challenge. As soon as Arthur grips the Green Knight’s axe, Sir Gawain leaps up and asks to take the challenge himself. He takes hold of the axe and, in one deadly blow, cuts off the knight’s head. To the amazement of the court, the now-headless Green Knight picks up his severed head. Before riding away, the head reiterates the terms of the pact, reminding the young Gawain to seek him in a year and a day at the Green Chapel. After the Green Knight leaves, the company goes back to its festival, but Gawain is uneasy.
Time passes, and autumn arrives. On the Day of All Saints, Gawain prepares to leave Camelot and find the Green Knight. He puts on his best armor, mounts his horse, Gringolet, and starts off toward North Wales, traveling through the wilderness of northwest Britain. Gawain encounters all sorts of beasts, suffers from hunger and cold, and grows more desperate as the days pass. On Christmas Day, he prays to find a place to hear Mass, then looks up to see a castle shimmering in the distance. The lord of the castle welcomes Gawain warmly, introducing him to his lady and to the old woman who sits beside her. For sport, the host (whose name is later revealed to be Bertilak) strikes a deal with Gawain: the host will go out hunting with his men every day, and when he returns in the evening, he will exchange his winnings for anything Gawain has managed to acquire by staying behind at the castle. Gawain happily agrees to the pact, and goes to bed.
The first day, the lord hunts a herd of does, while Gawain sleeps late in his bedchambers. On the morning of the first day, the lord’s wife sneaks into Gawain’s chambers and attempts to seduce him. Gawain puts her off, but before she leaves she steals one kiss from him. That evening, when the host gives Gawain the venison he has captured, Gawain kisses him, since he has won one kiss from the lady. The second day, the lord hunts a wild boar. The lady again enters Gawain’s chambers, and this time she kisses Gawain twice. That evening Gawain gives the host the two kisses in exchange for the boar’s head.
The third day, the lord hunts a fox, and the lady kisses Gawain three times. She also asks him for a love token, such as a ring or a glove. Gawain refuses to give her anything and refuses to take anything from her, until the lady mentions her girdle. The green silk girdle she wears around her waist is no ordinary piece of cloth, the lady claims, but possesses the magical ability to protect the person who wears it from death. Intrigued, Gawain accepts the cloth, but when it comes time to exchange his winnings with the host, Gawain gives the three kisses but does not mention the lady’s green girdle. The host gives Gawain the fox skin he won that day, and they all go to bed happy, but weighed down with the fact that Gawain must leave for the Green Chapel the following morning to find the Green Knight.
New Year’s Day arrives, and Gawain dons his armor, including the girdle, then sets off with Gringolet to seek the Green Knight. A guide accompanies him out of the estate grounds. When they reach the border of the forest, the guide promises not to tell anyone if Gawain decides to give up the quest. Gawain refuses, determined to meet his fate head-on. Eventually, he comes to a kind of crevice in a rock, visible through the tall grasses. He hears the whirring of a grindstone, confirming his suspicion that this strange cavern is in fact the Green Chapel. Gawain calls out, and the Green Knight emerges to greet him. Intent on fulfilling the terms of the contract, Gawain presents his neck to the Green Knight, who proceeds to feign two blows. On the third feint, the Green Knight nicks Gawain’s neck, barely drawing blood. Angered, Gawain shouts that their contract has been met, but the Green Knight merely laughs.
The Green Knight reveals his name, Bertilak, and explains that he is the lord of the castle where Gawain recently stayed. Because Gawain did not honestly exchange all of his winnings on the third day, Bertilak drew blood on his third blow. Nevertheless, Gawain has proven himself a worthy knight, without equal in all the land. When Gawain questions Bertilak further, Bertilak explains that the old woman at the castle is really Morgan le Fay, Gawain’s aunt and King Arthur’s half sister. She sent the Green Knight on his original errand and used her magic to change Bertilak’s appearance. Relieved to be alive but extremely guilty about his sinful failure to tell the whole truth, Gawain wears the girdle on his arm as a reminder of his own failure. He returns to Arthur’s court, where all the knights join Gawain, wearing girdles on their arms to show their support."
Red,"M. de Rênal, the mayor of the provincial town Verrières, hires Julien Sorel to be his children's tutor. Julien is only a carpenter's son, but dreams of following in the footsteps of his hero, Napoleon. However, in Julien's time, men gain power in the Church and not in the army. Even though he is training to become a priest, Julien decides to seduce the mayor's wife, Mme. de Rênal, because he thinks that it is his duty. They become lovers, but M. Valenod, the mayor's political adversary, finds out about the affair and begins to spread rumors. M. de Rênal is profoundly embarrassed, but his wife convinces him that the rumors are false. M. Chélan, the town priest and Julien's mentor, sends him to the Besançon seminary to avoid any further scandal.
The director of the seminary, M. Pirard, likes Julien and encourages him to become a great priest. Julien does very well at the seminary, but only because he wants to make a fortune and succeed in French society. The other priests at the seminary are not aware of Julien's hypocrisy, but are jealous of his intelligence. M. Pirard is disgusted with the political involvement of the Church and resigns. His aristocratic benefactor, the Marquis de la Mole, wants M. Pirard to be his personal secretary in Paris, but M. Pirard tells him to hire Julien instead.
Julien is both enthralled and repulsed by Parisian society at the same time. He tries to fit in among the nobles but they treat him as a social inferior. However, the Marquis's daughter, Mathilde, falls in love with Julien and they become lovers. When Mathilde gets pregnant and tells the Marquis about her affair, he is furious, but soon ennobles Julien so Mathilde can marry him. Julien finally has the aristocratic title he always wanted. But Mme. de Rênal sends the Marquis a letter denouncing Julien as a womanizer only concerned with making his fortune. The Marquis then refuses to let Mathilde marry Julien, who furiously returns to Verrières and shoots Mme. de Rênal. She survives, but Julien is sentenced to death anyway. Mme. de Rênal forgives Julien and dies of love three days after his execution."
Rate,"Guy Montag is a fireman who burns books in a futuristic American city. In Montag’s world, firemen start fires rather than putting them out. The people in this society do not read books, enjoy nature, spend time by themselves, think independently, or have meaningful conversations. Instead, they drive very fast, watch excessive amounts of television on wall-size sets, and listen to the radio on “Seashell Radio” sets attached to their ears.
Montag encounters a gentle seventeen-year-old girl named Clarisse McClellan, who opens his eyes to the emptiness of his life with her innocently penetrating questions and her unusual love of people and nature. Over the next few days, Montag experiences a series of disturbing events. First, his wife, Mildred, attempts suicide by swallowing a bottle of sleeping pills. Then, when he responds to an alarm that an old woman has a stash of hidden literature, the woman shocks him by choosing to be burned alive along with her books. A few days later, he hears that Clarisse has been killed by a speeding car. Montag’s dissatisfaction with his life increases, and he begins to search for a solution in a stash of books that he has stolen from his own fires and hidden inside an air-conditioning vent.
When Montag fails to show up for work, his fire chief, Beatty, pays a visit to his house. Beatty explains that it’s normal for a fireman to go through a phase of wondering what books have to offer, and he delivers a dizzying monologue explaining how books came to be banned in the first place. According to Beatty, special-interest groups and other “minorities” objected to books that offended them. Soon, books all began to look the same, as writers tried to avoid offending anybody. This was not enough, however, and society as a whole decided to simply burn books rather than permit conflicting opinions. Beatty tells Montag to take twenty-four hours or so to see if his stolen books contain anything worthwhile and then turn them in for incineration. Montag begins a long and frenzied night of reading.
Overwhelmed by the task of reading, Montag looks to his wife for help and support, but she prefers television to her husband’s company and cannot understand why he would want to take the terrible risk of reading books. He remembers that he once met a retired English professor named Faber sitting in a park, and he decides that this man might be able to help him understand what he reads. He visits Faber, who tells him that the value of books lies in the detailed awareness of life that they contain. Faber says that Montag needs not only books but also the leisure to read them and the freedom to act upon their ideas.
Faber agrees to help Montag with his reading, and they concoct a risky scheme to overthrow the status quo. Faber will contact a printer and begin reproducing books, and Montag will plant books in the homes of firemen to discredit the profession and to destroy the machinery of censorship. Faber gives him a two-way radio earpiece (the “green bullet”) so that he can hear what Montag hears and talk to him secretly.
Montag goes home, and soon two of his wife’s friends arrive to watch television. The women discuss their families and the war that is about to be declared in an extremely frivolous manner. Their superficiality angers him, and he takes out a book of poetry and reads “Dover Beach” by Matthew Arnold. Faber buzzes in his ear for him to be quiet, and Mildred tries to explain that the poetry reading is a standard way for firemen to demonstrate the uselessness of literature. The women are extremely disturbed by the poem and leave to file a complaint against Montag.
Montag goes to the fire station and hands over one of his books to Beatty. Beatty confuses Montag by barraging him with contradictory quotations from great books. Beatty exploits these contradictions to show that literature is morbid and dangerously complex, and that it deserves incineration. Suddenly, the alarm sounds, and they rush off to answer the call, only to find that the alarm is at Montag’s own house. Mildred gets into a cab with her suitcase, and Montag realizes that his own wife has betrayed him.
Beatty forces Montag to burn the house himself; when he is done, Beatty places him under arrest. When Beatty continues to berate Montag, Montag turns the flamethrower on his superior and proceeds to burn him to ashes. Montag knocks the other firemen unconscious and runs. The Mechanical Hound, a monstrous machine that Beatty has set to attack Montag, pounces and injects Montag’s leg with a large dose of anesthetic. Montag manages to destroy it with his flamethrower; then he walks off the numbness in his leg and escapes with some books that were hidden in his backyard. He hides these in another fireman’s house and calls in an alarm from a pay phone.
Montag goes to Faber’s house, where he learns that a new Hound has been put on his trail, along with several helicopters and a television crew. Faber tells Montag that he is leaving for St. Louis to see a retired printer who may be able to help them. Montag gives Faber some money and tells him how to remove Montag’s scent from his house so the Hound will not enter it. Montag then takes some of Faber’s old clothes and runs off toward the river. The whole city watches as the chase unfolds on TV, but Montag manages to escape in the river and change into Faber’s clothes to disguise his scent. He drifts downstream into the country and follows a set of abandoned railroad tracks until he finds a group of renegade intellectuals (“the Book People”), led by a man named Granger, who welcome him. They are a part of a nationwide network of book lovers who have memorized many great works of literature and philosophy. They hope that they may be of some help to mankind in the aftermath of the war that has just been declared. Montag’s role is to memorize the Book of Ecclesiastes. Enemy jets appear in the sky and completely obliterate the city with bombs. Montag and his new friends move on to search for survivors and rebuild civilization."
Lightened,"The Lightning Thief follows the story of young Percy Jackson, a troubled 12-year-old boy with a secret unknown even to himself. Diagnosed with dyslexia and ADHD, while being raised primarily by his mother, his life so far has not always been easy. Percy is repeatedly kicked out of school due to unexplainable events that aren’t really his fault. While on a sixth-grade field trip to a museum, Percy faces his strangest event yet. After an argument with a school bully, his math teacher, Mrs. Dodds, draws Percy aside to punish him. Mrs. Dodds suddenly transforms into a monster and attacks him. His favorite teacher, Mr. Brunner, rescues Percy by throwing him a ballpoint pen that changes into a sword. 
Although Percy defeats Mrs. Dodds, when he reunites with his other classmates, no one remembers her. In response, Percy acts out and is expelled from school. Percy overhears a conversation between Mr. Brunner and his friend Grover regarding Percy’s impending future, so he seeks answers from Grover on the bus ride home. After the bus breaks down, Percy and Grover notice three old women across the street knitting. One of the women cuts a string, which Percy and Grover discuss as signifying death. 
At home, Percy escapes his dreadful stepfather, whom he calls Smelly Gabe, by joining his mother, Sally, on a trip to their favorite beach where she originally met his birth father. Forceful winds and an unexpected visit from Grover lead Percy to reveal to his mother the incident that happened with Mrs. Dodds. After Percy finishes his story, Sally instructs Grover and Percy to get into the car where Percy notices Grover has hooves for feet and learns his friend is a satyr. Sally insists that Percy must go to a special camp for his safety. A monster chases after their car as they head in that direction, attacking Percy’s mother, which causes her to disappear into a golden light. Enraged, and fearing his mother’s death, Percy defeats the monster and obtains one of its horns as a souvenir. 
Percy arrives at Camp Half-Blood and meets Mr. D, the god of wine, and Chiron, a centaur, formerly known as Mr. Brunner, Percy’s Latin teacher. Chiron and Grover explain to Percy that he is a half-blood, or a demi-god, meaning that he is half mortal and half god. Since his godly parent is unknown, Percy is assigned the cabin dedicated to Hermes. At camp, Percy meets Annabeth, the daughter of Athena; his cabin counselor Luke, the son of Hermes; and Clarisse, the daughter of Ares. An altercation with Clarisse allows Percy to discover his father is Poseidon, one of the “Big Three” gods. This revelation is cut short when a hellhound attacks Percy from the Fields of Punishment. Chiron protects everyone at the camp by sending Percy off on a special quest to save the world.  
Percy’s Oracle reveals that Zeus has accused Poseidon of stealing his lightning bolt and requires Poseidon’s son to return it before the summer solstice. Chiron believes Hades actually stole the bolt to start a war between the gods. Percy chooses Grover and Annabeth to accompany him on his quest and together they head west to the entrance of the Underworld to confront Hades on the missing bolt. Along the way, the three will face several monsters before making it to Hades’ house. 
On one part of their journey, Percy and his friends fight the Furies, which causes the bus they are on to explode. After escaping into nearby woods, they come across a shop filled with many life-size statues. They meet Aunty Em, who Annabeth later identifies as Medusa. Percy defeats Medusa and sends her head to Olympus to show that he’s not a pawn in the gods’ game. Annabeth, Percy, and Grover take a train to Denver but stop at an Arch during a layover where Percy encounters the monsters Echidna and Chimera. He jumps off the Arch into the river to avoid dying and is met by a spirit who tells him to go to Santa Monica before going to the Underworld. 
In Denver, Percy, Annabeth, and Grover meet Ares, the god of war, who requests their help in retrieving his shield in exchange for information on Percy’s mother. Despite facing a trap placed by Hephaestus, Aphrodite’s husband, the three successfully grab the shield and return it to Ares who tells Percy that his mother is still alive. Ares gives the trio a backpack of supplies and safe transportation to Nevada.  
Percy and his friends continue west but lose track of time in a magical casino in Las Vegas, which leaves them only one more day to find and return the master bolt. Percy, Annabeth, and Grover arrive in Santa Monica where Percy receives three pearls from the same spirit who visited him in the river. The three search for directions to the Underworld and encounter a monster named Crusty. Percy defeats this monster and finds the address to an entrance to the Underworld. 
In the Underworld, Percy barters with Charon, a security officer, to let them in and tries to distract Cerberus, a three-headed security Rottweiler, but Annabeth is able to successfully command him. While on their way to Hades’ house, Grover’s flying shoes, on loan from Luke, pull him toward a pit Percy has dreamed uneasily about. Luckily, the shoes fall off before Grover reaches the pit. Finally, at the house, Hades accuses Percy of stealing his Helm of Darkness as well as the master bolt that surprisingly appears in the backpack Percy received from Ares. Hades reveals Percy’s mother to him in a golden light and says she will be returned once his helm is retrieved. Percy denies the allegations but after Hades threatens to kill his mother and unleash the dead back into the world, he agrees to find and return the helm. 
Percy, Grover, and Annabeth escape the Underworld and arrive in Santa Monica with the help of the magical pearls. They realize they have been manipulated by Ares and Percy confronts him about stealing the bolt and the helm. The two engage in battle. Percy defeats Ares after stabbing him in the heel. Rather than continue fighting, Ares accepts defeat but points out that Percy has made a new enemy. The Furies appear and return the Helm of Darkness to Hades while Percy, Annabeth, and Grover head to Olympus to return the bolt to Zeus.
 
Percy returns the bolt to Zeus on Mount Olympus and meets his father, Poseidon. Percy informs them of his quest and shares his concerns about the mysterious pit, but Zeus dismisses the conversation. He rewards Percy by sparing his life. Before returning home, Percy has a brief conversation with Poseidon about his mother who is safely back home. Percy learns that he has a decision to make regarding a package Poseidon has sent back to him. At home, Percy shares the details of his quest with his mother and discovers that the package with Medusa’s head has been returned to him. Before leaving for camp, he encourages his mother to use it on Smelly Gabe. 
Percy returns to Camp Half-Blood for the rest of the summer. While there, he learns his mother used Medusa to turn Smelly Gabe into a statue as she no longer needs to put up with him to keep Percy safe. She sells the statue and uses some of the money to enroll Percy in a new private school for the fall. Before the end of the summer, Percy learns that Luke was really the one responsible for stealing the master bolt and the Helm of Darkness in order to serve Kronos, a Titan and the father of Zeus. After Chiron tells Percy justice will be restored when the time is right, Percy makes plans to confront Luke the following summer."
Like,"John Howard Griffin, the author and main character of Black Like Me, is a middle-aged white man living in Mansfield, Texas, in 1959. Deeply committed to the cause of racial justice and frustrated by his inability as a white man to understand the Black experience, Griffin decides to take a radical step. He decides to undergo medical treatment to change the color of his skin and temporarily become a Black man. After securing the support of his wife and of George Levitan, the editor of a Black-oriented magazine called Sepia which will fund Griffin's experience in return for an article about it, Griffin sets out for New Orleans to begin his life posing as a Black man. He finds a contact in the Black community, a soft-spoken, wise shoe-shiner named Sterling Williams, and begins a dermatological regimen of exposure to ultraviolet light, oral medication, and skin dyes. Eventually, Griffin looks in the mirror and sees a Black man looking back. He briefly panics, feeling that he has lost his identity, and then he sets out to explore the Black community.
Griffin expects to find prejudice, oppression, and hardship, but he is shocked at the extent of it. Everywhere he goes, he experiences difficulties and insults. The word “n*****” seems to echo from every street corner. It is impossible to find a job, or even a restroom that Blacks are allowed to use. Clerks refuse to cash his checks, and a white bully nearly attacks him before he chases the man away. After several traumatic days in New Orleans, Griffin decides to travel into the Deep South of Mississippi and Alabama, which are reputed to be even worse for Black people. (In Mississippi, a grand jury has just refused to indict a lynch mob that murdered a Black man before he could stand trial.) In Mississippi, he is disheartened and exhausted, so he calls a white friend named P.D. East, a newspaperman who is ferociously opposed to racism. He spends a day with East, during which time they discuss the way racial prejudice has been incorporated into the South's legal code by bigoted writers and politicians. Eventually, a rejuvenated Griffin leaves for a long hitchhiking trip throughout Alabama and Mississippi.
In general, Griffin finds that conditions for Black people are appalling, and that Black communities seem run-down and defeated. He even notices a look of defeat and hopelessness on his own face, after only a few weeks as a Black man. In Montgomery, however, the Black community is charged with determination and energy by the example of one of its leaders, a preacher named Marin Luther King, Jr. Black people in Montgomery have begun practicing passive resistance, a nonviolent form of refusing to comply with racist laws and rules.
Griffin, again depressed and weary of life as a Black man, briefly stops taking his medication and lightens his skin back to his normal color. He begins alternating back and forth between races, visiting a place first as a Black man and then as a white man. He notices immediately that when he is a white man, whites treat him with respect and Black people treat him with suspicious fear; when he is a Black man, Black people treat him with generosity and warmth, while whites treat him with hostility and contempt. Griffin concludes that the races do not understand one another at all, and that a tolerant dialogue is needed to bridge the terrible gap separating them.
In Atlanta, Griffin conducts a long series of interviews with Black leaders before returning to New Orleans to make a photographic record of his time there. He then goes off his medication entirely, permanently returning his skin color to white. He returns home to his family and writes his article, which is published in March 1960. After the article appears, Griffin is called on to do interviews with prominent television shows and newsmagazines. The story of his amazing experience quickly spreads around the world, and he receives a flood of congratulatory mail.
In Mansfield, however, the prevalent attitude is that of racism, and Griffin and his family become the subject of hateful reprisals. An effigy of Griffin, painted half white and half black, is burned on Main Street; a cross is burned in a Negro schoolyard; threats are made against Griffin, including one to castrate him. By August, things are so bad that he has decided to move his family to Mexico. Before he goes, he has a talk with a young Black boy, to whom he explains that racism is a result of social conditioning, not any inherent quality within Blacks or whites. He issues a plea for tolerance and understanding between the races, fearing that, if the current conflict is sustained, it will explode in an outbreak of terrible violence."
Traveled,"Gulliver’s Travels recounts the story of Lemuel Gulliver, a practical-minded Englishman trained as a surgeon who takes to the seas when his business fails. In a deadpan first-person narrative that rarely shows any signs of self-reflection or deep emotional response, Gulliver narrates the adventures that befall him on these travels.
Gulliver’s adventure in Lilliput begins when he wakes after his shipwreck to find himself bound by innumerable tiny threads and addressed by tiny captors who are in awe of him but fiercely protective of their kingdom. They are not afraid to use violence against Gulliver, though their arrows are little more than pinpricks. But overall, they are hospitable, risking famine in their land by feeding Gulliver, who consumes more food than a thousand Lilliputians combined could. Gulliver is taken into the capital city by a vast wagon the Lilliputians have specially built. He is presented to the emperor, who is entertained by Gulliver, just as Gulliver is flattered by the attention of royalty. Eventually Gulliver becomes a national resource, used by the army in its war against the people of Blefuscu, whom the Lilliputians hate for doctrinal differences concerning the proper way to crack eggs. But things change when Gulliver is convicted of treason for putting out a fire in the royal palace with his urine and is condemned to be shot in the eyes and starved to death. Gulliver escapes to Blefuscu, where he is able to repair a boat he finds and set sail for England.
After staying in England with his wife and family for two months, Gulliver undertakes his next sea voyage, which takes him to a land of giants called Brobdingnag. Here, a field worker discovers him. The farmer initially treats him as little more than an animal, keeping him for amusement. The farmer eventually sells Gulliver to the queen, who makes him a courtly diversion and is entertained by his musical talents. Social life is easy for Gulliver after his discovery by the court, but not particularly enjoyable. Gulliver is often repulsed by the physicality of the Brobdingnagians, whose ordinary flaws are many times magnified by their huge size. Thus, when a couple of courtly ladies let him play on their naked bodies, he is not attracted to them but rather disgusted by their enormous skin pores and the sound of their torrential urination. He is generally startled by the ignorance of the people here—even the king knows nothing about politics. More unsettling findings in Brobdingnag come in the form of various animals of the realm that endanger his life. Even Brobdingnagian insects leave slimy trails on his food that make eating difficult. On a trip to the frontier, accompanying the royal couple, Gulliver leaves Brobdingnag when his cage is plucked up by an eagle and dropped into the sea.
Next, Gulliver sets sail again and, after an attack by pirates, ends up in Laputa, where a floating island inhabited by theoreticians and academics oppresses the land below, called Balnibarbi. The scientific research undertaken in Laputa and in Balnibarbi seems totally inane and impractical, and its residents too appear wholly out of touch with reality. Taking a short side trip to Glubbdubdrib, Gulliver is able to witness the conjuring up of figures from history, such as Julius Caesar and other military leaders, whom he finds much less impressive than in books. After visiting the Luggnaggians and the Struldbrugs, the latter of which are senile immortals who prove that age does not bring wisdom, he is able to sail to Japan and from there back to England.
Finally, on his fourth journey, Gulliver sets out as captain of a ship, but after the mutiny of his crew and a long confinement in his cabin, he arrives in an unknown land. This land is populated by Houyhnhnms, rational-thinking horses who rule, and by Yahoos, brutish humanlike creatures who serve the Houyhnhnms. Gulliver sets about learning their language, and when he can speak he narrates his voyages to them and explains the constitution of England. He is treated with great courtesy and kindness by the horses and is enlightened by his many conversations with them and by his exposure to their noble culture. He wants to stay with the Houyhnhnms, but his bared body reveals to the horses that he is very much like a Yahoo, and he is banished. Gulliver is grief-stricken but agrees to leave. He fashions a canoe and makes his way to a nearby island, where he is picked up by a Portuguese ship captain who treats him well, though Gulliver cannot help now seeing the captain—and all humans—as shamefully Yahoolike. Gulliver then concludes his narrative with a claim that the lands he has visited belong by rights to England, as her colonies, even though he questions the whole idea of colonialism."
Earn,"Jack Worthing, the play’s protagonist, is a pillar of the community in Hertfordshire, where he is guardian to Cecily Cardew, the pretty, eighteen-year-old granddaughter of the late Thomas Cardew, who found and adopted Jack when he was a baby. In Hertfordshire, Jack has responsibilities: he is a major landowner and justice of the peace, with tenants, farmers, and a number of servants and other employees all dependent on him. For years, he has also pretended to have an irresponsible black-sheep brother named Ernest who leads a scandalous life in pursuit of pleasure and is always getting into trouble of a sort that requires Jack to rush grimly off to his assistance. In fact, Ernest is merely Jack’s alibi, a phantom that allows him to disappear for days at a time and do as he likes. No one but Jack knows that he himself is Ernest. Ernest is the name Jack goes by in London, which is where he really goes on these occasions—probably to pursue the very sort of behavior he pretends to disapprove of in his imaginary brother.
Jack is in love with Gwendolen Fairfax, the cousin of his best friend, Algernon Moncrieff. When the play opens, Algernon, who knows Jack as Ernest, has begun to suspect something, having found an inscription inside Jack’s cigarette case addressed to “Uncle Jack” from someone who refers to herself as “little Cecily.” Algernon suspects that Jack may be leading a double life, a practice he seems to regard as commonplace and indispensable to modern life. He calls a person who leads a double life a “Bunburyist,” after a nonexistent friend he pretends to have, a chronic invalid named Bunbury, to whose deathbed he is forever being summoned whenever he wants to get out of some tiresome social obligation.
At the beginning of Act 1, Jack drops in unexpectedly on Algernon and announces that he intends to propose to Gwendolen. Algernon confronts him with the cigarette case and forces him to come clean, demanding to know who “Jack” and “Cecily” are. Jack confesses that his name isn’t really Ernest and that Cecily is his ward, a responsibility imposed on him by his adoptive father’s will. Jack also tells Algernon about his fictional brother. Jack says he’s been thinking of killing off this fake brother, since Cecily has been showing too active an interest in him. Without meaning to, Jack describes Cecily in terms that catch Algernon’s attention and make him even more interested in her than he is already.
Gwendolen and her mother, Lady Bracknell, arrive, which gives Jack an opportunity to propose to Gwendolen. Jack is delighted to discover that Gwendolen returns his affections, but he is alarmed to learn that Gwendolen is fixated on the name Ernest, which she says “inspires absolute confidence.” Gwendolen makes clear that she would not consider marrying a man who was not named Ernest.
Lady Bracknell interviews Jack to determine his eligibility as a possible son-in-law, and during this interview she asks about his family background. When Jack explains that he has no idea who his parents were and that he was found, by the man who adopted him, in a handbag in the cloakroom at Victoria Station, Lady Bracknell is scandalized. She forbids the match between Jack and Gwendolen and sweeps out of the house.
In Act 2, Algernon shows up at Jack’s country estate posing as Jack’s brother Ernest. Meanwhile, Jack, having decided that Ernest has outlived his usefulness, arrives home in deep mourning, full of a story about Ernest having died suddenly in Paris. He is enraged to find Algernon there masquerading as Ernest but has to go along with the charade. If he doesn’t, his own lies and deceptions will be revealed.
While Jack changes out of his mourning clothes, Algernon, who has fallen hopelessly in love with Cecily, asks her to marry him. He is surprised to discover that Cecily already considers that they are engaged, and he is charmed when she reveals that her fascination with “Uncle Jack’s brother” led her to invent an elaborate romance between herself and him several months ago. Algernon is less enchanted to learn that part of Cecily’s interest in him derives from the name Ernest, which, unconsciously echoing Gwendolen, she says “inspires absolute confidence.”
Algernon goes off in search of Dr. Chasuble, the local rector, to see about getting himself christened Ernest. Meanwhile, Gwendolen arrives, having decided to pay Jack an unexpected visit. Gwendolen is shown into the garden, where Cecily orders tea and attempts to play hostess. Cecily has no idea how Gwendolen figures into Jack’s life, and Gwendolen, for her part, has no idea who Cecily is. Gwendolen initially thinks Cecily is a visitor to the Manor House and is disconcerted to learn that Cecily is “Mr. Worthing’s ward.” She notes that Ernest has never mentioned having a ward, and Cecily explains that it is not Ernest Worthing who is her guardian but his brother Jack and, in fact, that she is engaged to be married to Ernest Worthing. Gwendolen points out that this is impossible as she herself is engaged to Ernest Worthing. The tea party degenerates into a war of manners.
Jack and Algernon arrive toward the climax of this confrontation, each having separately made arrangements with Dr. Chasuble to be christened Ernest later that day. Each of the young ladies points out that the other has been deceived: Cecily informs Gwendolen that her fiancé is really named Jack and Gwendolen informs Cecily that hers is really called Algernon. The two women demand to know where Jack’s brother Ernest is, since both of them are engaged to be married to him. Jack is forced to admit that he has no brother and that Ernest is a complete fiction. Both women are shocked and furious, and they retire to the house arm in arm.
Act 3 takes place in the drawing room of the Manor House, where Cecily and Gwendolen have retired. When Jack and Algernon enter from the garden, the two women confront them. Cecily asks Algernon why he pretended to be her guardian’s brother. Algernon tells her he did it in order to meet her. Gwendolen asks Jack whether he pretended to have a brother in order to come into London to see her as often as possible, and she interprets his evasive reply as an affirmation. The women are somewhat appeased but still concerned over the issue of the name. However, when Jack and Algernon tell Gwendolen and Cecily that they have both made arrangements to be christened Ernest that afternoon, all is forgiven and the two pairs of lovers embrace. At this moment, Lady Bracknell’s arrival is announced.
Lady Bracknell has followed Gwendolen from London, having bribed Gwendolen’s maid to reveal her destination. She demands to know what is going on. Gwendolen again informs Lady Bracknell of her engagement to Jack, and Lady Bracknell reiterates that a union between them is out of the question. Algernon tells Lady Bracknell of his engagement to Cecily, prompting her to inspect Cecily and inquire into her social connections, which she does in a routine and patronizing manner that infuriates Jack. He replies to all her questions with a mixture of civility and sarcasm, withholding until the last possible moment the information that Cecily is actually worth a great deal of money and stands to inherit still more when she comes of age. At this, Lady Bracknell becomes genuinely interested.
Jack informs Lady Bracknell that, as Cecily’s legal guardian, he refuses to give his consent to her union with Algernon. Lady Bracknell suggests that the two young people simply wait until Cecily comes of age, and Jack points out that under the terms of her grandfather’s will, Cecily does not legally come of age until she is thirty-five. Lady Bracknell asks Jack to reconsider, and he points out that the matter is entirely in her own hands. As soon as she consents to his marriage to Gwendolen, Cecily can have his consent to marry Algernon. However, Lady Bracknell refuses to entertain the notion. She and Gwendolen are on the point of leaving when Dr. Chasuble arrives and happens to mention Cecily’s governess, Miss Prism. At this, Lady Bracknell starts and asks that Miss Prism be sent for.
When the governess arrives and catches sight of Lady Bracknell, she begins to look guilty and furtive. Lady Bracknell accuses her of having left her sister’s house twenty-eight years before with a baby and never returned. She demands to know where the baby is. Miss Prism confesses she doesn’t know, explaining that she lost the baby, having absentmindedly placed it in a handbag in which she had meant to place the manuscript for a novel she had written. Jack asks what happened to the bag, and Miss Prism says she left it in the cloakroom of a railway station. Jack presses her for further details and goes racing offstage, returning a few moments later with a large handbag. When Miss Prism confirms that the bag is hers, Jack throws himself on her with a cry of “Mother!” It takes a while before the situation is sorted out, but before too long we understand that Jack is not the illegitimate child of Miss Prism but the legitimate child of Lady Bracknell’s sister and, therefore, Algernon’s older brother. Furthermore, Jack had been originally christened “Ernest John.” All these years Jack has unwittingly been telling the truth: Ernest is his name, as is Jack, and he does have an unprincipled younger brother—Algernon. Again the couples embrace, Miss Prism and Dr. Chasuble follow suit, and Jack acknowledges that he now understands “the vital Importance of Being Earnest.”"
Build,"The story begins with the unnamed main character, simply referred to as “the man,” on the Yukon trail. He is in the middle of a cold and isolated setting. The ground is covered in snow, and it is −75 degrees F. The man is a newcomer to the Yukon and is traveling alone except for his dog. They are heading to a camp where the man will join his companions. The man thinks happily of the lunch he carries with him and looks forward to finding his friends that night. He is not concerned about the cold, even as ice has frozen his lips together. The dog, on the other hand, senses the danger in the extreme cold. It expects the man to find shelter or build a fire. The omniscient narrator also comments on the danger in the man’s narrow perspective and lack of understanding.
The man hikes along a frozen creek, noticing areas where water has run down into the ice, making pools that could get him very wet if he fell through. The man knows that wet feet would cause trouble and delay his journey, but he does not fully consider the danger of wet feet. Nonetheless, he is cautious as he walks along the ice. At one point, he forces his dog to go ahead over some dangerous ice and it falls through. The dog climbs out, and the water immediately freezes on its legs and paws. The dog bites the ice off, and the man helps it clear its paws.
By noon, the man is pleased with his progress. He sits down and tries to eat his lunch but is shocked to discover how numb his hands have become and that his mouth has frozen over too much for him to eat. He realizes that he should build a fire. The man remembers how “a man from Sulphur Creek” had warned him about the cold but he had dismissed the danger. He slowly builds a fire and eats lunch. After he smokes a pipe, he sets off again. The dog enjoys the warm fire and is reluctant to leave it. The dog’s instinct tells it that they should not travel in the cold but should find shelter. 
The man and the dog continue up the creek until the man falls in a pool, ending up soaked to his knees. He is angry, but not frightened. He must build a fire to dry out his socks and moccasins. Slowly, he builds a fire with grass, bark, and larger and larger sticks. The narrator explains that a man must warm up quickly if his feet are wet when the temperature is this low. The man knows this as well, since he has been told so by the old man on Sulphur Creek. Additionally, he has lost all feeling in his feet and his hands are going numb. Now that he has stopped walking, his blood itself feels the cold. He feels it sinking away from his hands, feet, and skin to hide from the cold. He is surprised by how quickly his hands grow numb, and his face freezes, but the man is confident in his growing fire. He plans to warm his moccasins and feet there. He thinks back to the old man on Sulphur Creek and laughs at his warning that no one should travel alone when it is that cold. He is confident that he has saved himself.
However, disaster strikes. The man has built his fire under a tree with branches covered with snow. When he pulls sticks free, he dislodges some of the snow. In a cascading effect, snow falls from all the branches down onto his fire. It puts the fire out. The man finally begins to realize that he is in real danger. He wonders if he should have had a companion on the trip who could have built a second fire, but he must try to build another fire himself. He makes a pile of dry grass, sticks, and branches in an open space. The dog watches anxiously, depending on the man to provide a fire. The man tries to find his piece of tree bark but can’t. He realizes that his feet are freezing and beats his hands until he has feeling enough to find his bark. He is jealous of the dog’s warm fur as he struggles to light a match. But his hands are too numb to pull off a match and he drops them all in the snow. He even tries to light one with his teeth, but he coughs and drops it in the snow.
The man becomes more desperate. He burns all seventy matches at once. He tries to light the tree bark and badly burns his hands. He finally lights the bark and tries to build up the fire, using his teeth as well as his hands. But he accidentally scatters the fire, and it goes out. The man sees the dog looking at him uneasily. He decides he must kill the dog and use its warm body to defrost his hands. He calls the dog, but the dog hears a strange, frightened tone in his voice and won’t obey. He crawls toward the dog, but it backs away. The man forces himself to stand up and this reassures the dog enough that the man can grab it with his arms because his hands are too frozen. He realizes that his hands are too frozen to kill the dog anyway. Even beating his hands for five minutes does not bring feeling back. 
The man knows now that his life is in danger. In terror, he runs up the creek bed with the dog following. He oscillates between hope that he can somehow run to the camp and the knowledge that he is too frozen to make it. He cannot even feel his feet as he runs. He falls and feels warm and comfortable, although he has lost feeling in his face as well. He is frightened by this and runs again but falls a second time. He is angered by the dog’s apparent warmth and yells at it, then runs again. This time he only makes it a hundred feet before he falls. At this point, the man accepts his coming death. He imagines himself as one of “the boys,” coming down the trail and finding his own body in the snow. In his mind, the man tells the old man in Sulphur Creek that he was right. He falls into a peaceful sleep as he freezes to death. The dog stays for a while, confused that he is sitting in the snow without making a fire. Eventually it realizes the man is dead and heads up the trail alone, in search of other humans who can provide food and warmth."
Dimensions,"In Part I of The Elegant Universe, “The Edge of Knowledge,” Greene introduces the central problem of modern physics: the incompatibility of Einstein’s theory of general relativity with quantum mechanics. He then lists the physical curiosities—properties of the motion of light, gravity, and the behavior of particles at the subatomic level—that have prevented physicists from establishing a single coherent theory for how the universe works. For most of the twentieth century, physicists contented themselves with describing either the most small-scale or the most large-scale workings of the cosmos, but never both simultaneously. At the end of this section, Greene describes both the objectives and the promise of superstring theory, which attempts to merge the laws of general relativity with those of quantum mechanics.
Without dismissing the importance of electrons and quarks, which are the basis of quantum mechanics, superstring theory depicts the smallest particles in the universe not as dots but as tiny strings of energy. These strings are one hundred billion billion (a quintillion) times smaller than a single atomic nucleus. They vibrate in different patterns, which in turn produce different particle properties. But because these strings are too tiny to locate with current scientific tools, superstring theory is not yet predictable or testable. Therefore, physicists like Greene must work with approximations of equations until more information has been verified. Still, the promise of string theory is tremendous. Only string theory’s conceptual framework offers any possibility of unifying general relativity and quantum mechanics into one complete understanding of how the universe works.
In Part II, “The Dilemma of Space, Time, and the Quanta,” Greene reviews the basic precepts of the two competing theories—first, Einstein’s special and general relativity, and then the “microscopic weirdness” of quantum mechanics. General relativity presupposes a smooth surface of space, but at an ultramicroscopic level (which quantum mechanics has helped unveil), the spatial fabric is subject to violent undulations known as “quantum foam.” Greene also discusses the basic principle of quantum mechanics: the uncertainty principle. The uncertainty principle predicts the impossibility of knowing both the exact location and the velocity of a particle at any given time. Greene goes over the four fundamental forces—the strong force, the weak force, electromagnetism, and gravity—and he describes the complexity of incorporating gravity into the standard model of the first three. In the last chapter of this section, Greene stresses the necessity of finding a new theory that revises both general relativity and quantum mechanics. Like many of his colleagues, Greene simply cannot accept that the universe is, at its core, divided into two contradictory theoretical frameworks.
In Part III, “The Cosmic Symphony,” Greene discusses in detail how superstring theory works. He employs many musical metaphors to suggest how strings “harmonize” or bring together the most puzzling aspects of the cosmos. After praising the elegance and economy of the theory, Greene gives a brief history of its first incarnation in the 1970s, when it was referred to as the bosonic string theory. He also explains the subsequent revisions the theory underwent during the first superstring revolution in 1984. Greene then describes how supersymmetry— a concept that predicts the existence of superpartners that correspond with all known particles—transformed string theory into superstring theory.
With these basics covered, Greene proceeds to one of the oddest claims of string theory: the theory that the universe contains far more dimensions than we can perceive. In its current form, superstring theory postulates the existence of eleven total dimensions: ten of space and one of time. According to the theory, equations of quantum theory can mesh beautifully with relativity if we assume the existence of eleven dimensions. Greene concludes “The Cosmic Symphony” by analyzing the central difficulty of string theory—namely, the lack of experimental evidence for superstring theory. He describes the efforts he and his colleagues have made to develop string theory and refine its underlying mathematical principles. He shows what a Calabi-Yau space (the six-dimensional shape that physicists believe the additional, curled-up dimensions of space will form) may look like.
Part IV, “String Theory and the Fabric of Spacetime,” is the most complicated and involved section of the book. Greene begins with an overview of quantum geometry and the new kind of math that must emerge to explain the universe on an ultramicroscopic scale. He argues that contrary to what physicists previously believed, the fabric of space can be ripped and torn with no catastrophic consequences. He also covers the second superstring revolution, which shows that all five string theories are really part of a single, unified framework called M-theory. It is fitting that no one knows what the “M” signifies, because M-theory is one of the most radical, incompletely understood theories ever to evolve. M-theory proposes the unification of gravity with the three nongravitational forces. It is an extension of string theory that suggests the elementary particles of the universe might include, in addition to strings, two-dimensional membranes and three-dimensional blobs of varying size. Greene ends his discussion of the latest advances in superstring theory by discussing its cosmological implications, what it might reveal about the origins of the universe.
Part V, “Unification in the Twenty-First Century,” concludes the book. It covers the prospects of string theory in the twenty-first century. It describes the advances Greene and other string theorists hope to make in unveiling a single theory to explain the entire universe. For all his optimistic predictions, however, Greene never hesitates to admit that because of its complexity, superstring theory might not be fully understood for many years."
1899,"Heart of Darkness centers around Marlow, an introspective sailor, and his journey up the Congo River to meet Kurtz, reputed to be an idealistic man of great abilities. Marlow takes a job as a riverboat captain with the Company, a Belgian concern organized to trade in the Congo. As he travels to Africa and then up the Congo, Marlow encounters widespread inefficiency and brutality in the Company’s stations. The native inhabitants of the region have been forced into the Company’s service, and they suffer terribly from overwork and ill treatment at the hands of the Company’s agents. The cruelty and squalor of imperial enterprise contrasts sharply with the impassive and majestic jungle that surrounds the white man’s settlements, making them appear to be tiny islands amidst a vast darkness.
Marlow arrives at the Central Station, run by the general manager, an unwholesome, conspiratorial character. He finds that his steamship has been sunk and spends several months waiting for parts to repair it. His interest in Kurtz grows during this period. The manager and his favorite, the brickmaker, seem to fear Kurtz as a threat to their position. Kurtz is rumored to be ill, making the delays in repairing the ship all the more costly. Marlow eventually gets the parts he needs to repair his ship, and he and the manager set out with a few agents (whom Marlow calls pilgrims because of their strange habit of carrying long, wooden staves wherever they go) and a crew of cannibals on a long, difficult voyage up the river. The dense jungle and the oppressive silence make everyone aboard a little jumpy, and the occasional glimpse of a native village or the sound of drums works the pilgrims into a frenzy.
Marlow and his crew come across a hut with stacked firewood, together with a note saying that the wood is for them but that they should approach cautiously. Shortly after the steamer has taken on the firewood, it is surrounded by a dense fog. When the fog clears, the ship is attacked by an unseen band of natives, who fire arrows from the safety of the forest. The African helmsman is killed before Marlow frightens the natives away with the ship’s steam whistle. Not long after, Marlow and his companions arrive at Kurtz’s Inner Station, expecting to find him dead, but a half-crazed Russian trader, who meets them as they come ashore, assures them that everything is fine and informs them that he is the one who left the wood. The Russian claims that Kurtz has enlarged his mind and cannot be subjected to the same moral judgments as normal people. Apparently, Kurtz has established himself as a god with the natives and has gone on brutal raids in the surrounding territory in search of ivory. The collection of severed heads adorning the fence posts around the station attests to his “methods.” The pilgrims bring Kurtz out of the station-house on a stretcher, and a large group of native warriors pours out of the forest and surrounds them. Kurtz speaks to them, and the natives disappear into the woods.
The manager brings Kurtz, who is quite ill, aboard the steamer. A beautiful native woman, apparently Kurtz’s mistress, appears on the shore and stares out at the ship. The Russian implies that she is somehow involved with Kurtz and has caused trouble before through her influence over him. The Russian reveals to Marlow, after swearing him to secrecy, that Kurtz had ordered the attack on the steamer to make them believe he was dead in order that they might turn back and leave him to his plans. The Russian then leaves by canoe, fearing the displeasure of the manager. Kurtz disappears in the night, and Marlow goes out in search of him, finding him crawling on all fours toward the native camp. Marlow stops him and convinces him to return to the ship. They set off down the river the next morning, but Kurtz’s health is failing fast.
Marlow listens to Kurtz talk while he pilots the ship, and Kurtz entrusts Marlow with a packet of personal documents, including an eloquent pamphlet on civilizing the savages which ends with a scrawled message that says, “Exterminate all the brutes!” The steamer breaks down, and they have to stop for repairs. Kurtz dies, uttering his last words—“The horror! The horror!”—in the presence of the confused Marlow. Marlow falls ill soon after and barely survives. Eventually he returns to Europe and goes to see Kurtz’s Intended (his fiancée). She is still in mourning, even though it has been over a year since Kurtz’s death, and she praises him as a paragon of virtue and achievement. She asks what his last words were, but Marlow cannot bring himself to shatter her illusions with the truth. Instead, he tells her that Kurtz’s last word was her name."
120,"In the midst of a raging war, a plane evacuating a group of schoolboys from Britain is shot down over a deserted tropical island. Two of the boys, Ralph and Piggy, discover a conch shell on the beach, and Piggy realizes it could be used as a horn to summon the other boys. Once assembled, the boys set about electing a leader and devising a way to be rescued. They choose Ralph as their leader, and Ralph appoints another boy, Jack, to be in charge of the boys who will hunt food for the entire group.
Ralph, Jack, and another boy, Simon, set off on an expedition to explore the island. When they return, Ralph declares that they must light a signal fire to attract the attention of passing ships. The boys succeed in igniting some dead wood by focusing sunlight through the lenses of Piggy’s eyeglasses. However, the boys pay more attention to playing than to monitoring the fire, and the flames quickly engulf the forest. A large swath of dead wood burns out of control, and one of the youngest boys in the group disappears, presumably having burned to death.
At first, the boys enjoy their life without grown-ups and spend much of their time splashing in the water and playing games. Ralph, however, complains that they should be maintaining the signal fire and building huts for shelter. The hunters fail in their attempt to catch a wild pig, but their leader, Jack, becomes increasingly preoccupied with the act of hunting.
When a ship passes by on the horizon one day, Ralph and Piggy notice, to their horror, that the signal fire—which had been the hunters’ responsibility to maintain—has burned out. Furious, Ralph accosts Jack, but the hunter has just returned with his first kill, and all the hunters seem gripped with a strange frenzy, reenacting the chase in a kind of wild dance. Piggy criticizes Jack, who hits Piggy across the face. Ralph blows the conch shell and reprimands the boys in a speech intended to restore order. At the meeting, it quickly becomes clear that some of the boys have started to become afraid. The littlest boys, known as “littluns,” have been troubled by nightmares from the beginning, and more and more boys now believe that there is some sort of beast or monster lurking on the island. The older boys try to convince the others at the meeting to think rationally, asking where such a monster could possibly hide during the daytime. One of the littluns suggests that it hides in the sea—a proposition that terrifies the entire group.
Not long after the meeting, some military planes engage in a battle high above the island. The boys, asleep below, do not notice the flashing lights and explosions in the clouds. A parachutist drifts to earth on the signal-fire mountain, dead. Sam and Eric, the twins responsible for watching the fire at night, are asleep and do not see the parachutist land. When the twins wake up, they see the enormous silhouette of his parachute and hear the strange flapping noises it makes. Thinking the island beast is at hand, they rush back to the camp in terror and report that the beast has attacked them.
The boys organize a hunting expedition to search for the monster. Jack and Ralph, who are increasingly at odds, travel up the mountain. They see the silhouette of the parachute from a distance and think that it looks like a huge, deformed ape. The group holds a meeting at which Jack and Ralph tell the others of the sighting. Jack says that Ralph is a coward and that he should be removed from office, but the other boys refuse to vote Ralph out of power. Jack angrily runs away down the beach, calling all the hunters to join him. Ralph rallies the remaining boys to build a new signal fire, this time on the beach rather than on the mountain. They obey, but before they have finished the task, most of them have slipped away to join Jack.
Jack declares himself the leader of the new tribe of hunters and organizes a hunt and a violent, ritual slaughter of a sow to solemnize the occasion. The hunters then decapitate the sow and place its head on a sharpened stake in the jungle as an offering to the beast. Later, encountering the bloody, fly-covered head, Simon has a terrible vision, during which it seems to him that the head is speaking. The voice, which he imagines as belonging to the Lord of the Flies, says that Simon will never escape him, for he exists within all men. Simon faints. When he wakes up, he goes to the mountain, where he sees the dead parachutist. Understanding then that the beast does not exist externally but rather within each individual boy, Simon travels to the beach to tell the others what he has seen. But the others are in the midst of a chaotic revelry—even Ralph and Piggy have joined Jack’s feast—and when they see Simon’s shadowy figure emerge from the jungle, they fall upon him and kill him with their bare hands and teeth.
The following morning, Ralph and Piggy discuss what they have done. Jack’s hunters attack them and their few followers and steal Piggy’s glasses in the process. Ralph’s group travels to Jack’s stronghold in an attempt to make Jack see reason, but Jack orders Sam and Eric tied up and fights with Ralph. In the ensuing battle, one boy, Roger, rolls a boulder down the mountain, killing Piggy and shattering the conch shell. Ralph barely manages to escape a torrent of spears.
Ralph hides for the rest of the night and the following day, while the others hunt him like an animal. Jack has the other boys ignite the forest in order to smoke Ralph out of his hiding place. Ralph stays in the forest, where he discovers and destroys the sow’s head, but eventually, he is forced out onto the beach, where he knows the other boys will soon arrive to kill him. Ralph collapses in exhaustion, but when he looks up, he sees a British naval officer standing over him. The officer’s ship noticed the fire raging in the jungle. The other boys reach the beach and stop in their tracks at the sight of the officer. Amazed at the spectacle of this group of bloodthirsty, savage children, the officer asks Ralph to explain. Ralph is overwhelmed by the knowledge that he is safe but, thinking about what has happened on the island, he begins to weep. The other boys begin to sob as well. The officer turns his back so that the boys may regain their composure."
Among,"Two migrant workers, George and Lennie, have been let off a bus miles away from the California farm where they are due to start work. George is a small, dark man with “sharp, strong features.” Lennie, his companion, is his opposite, a giant of a man with a “shapeless” face. Overcome with thirst, the two stop in a clearing by a pool and decide to camp for the night. As the two converse, it becomes clear that Lennie has an intellectual disability, and is deeply devoted to George and dependent upon him for protection and guidance. George finds that Lennie, who loves petting soft things but often accidentally kills them, has been carrying and stroking a dead mouse. George angrily throws it away, fearing that Lennie might catch a disease from the dead animal. George complains loudly that his life would be easier without having to care for Lennie, but the reader senses that their friendship and devotion is mutual. He and Lennie share a dream of buying their own piece of land, farming it, and, much to Lennie’s delight, keeping rabbits. George ends the night by treating Lennie to the story he often tells him about what life will be like in such an idyllic place.
The next day, the men report to the nearby ranch. George, fearing how the boss will react to Lennie, insists that he’ll do all the talking. He lies, explaining that they travel together because they are cousins and that a horse kicked Lennie in the head when he was a child. They are hired. They meet Candy, an old “swamper,” or handyman, with a missing hand and an ancient dog, and Curley, the boss’s mean-spirited son. Curley is newly married, possessive of his flirtatious wife, and full of jealous suspicion. Once George and Lennie are alone in the bunkhouse, Curley’s wife appears and flirts with them. Lennie thinks she is “purty,” but George, sensing the trouble that could come from tangling with this woman and her husband, warns Lennie to stay away from her. Soon, the ranch-hands return from the fields for lunch, and George and Lennie meet Slim, the skilled mule driver who wields great authority on the ranch. Slim comments on the rarity of friendship like that between George and Lennie. Carlson, another ranch-hand, suggests that since Slim’s dog has just given birth, they should offer a puppy to Candy and shoot Candy’s old, good-for-nothing dog.
The next day, George confides in Slim that he and Lennie are not cousins, but have been friends since childhood. He tells how Lennie has often gotten them into trouble. For instance, they were forced to flee their last job because Lennie tried to touch a woman’s dress and was accused of rape. Slim agrees to give Lennie one of his puppies, and Carlson continues to badger Candy to kill his old dog. When Slim agrees with Carlson, saying that death would be a welcome relief to the suffering animal, Candy gives in. Carlson, before leading the dog outside, promises to do the job painlessly.
Slim goes to the barn to do some work, and Curley, who is maniacally searching for his wife, heads to the barn to accost Slim. Candy overhears George and Lennie discussing their plans to buy land, and offers his life’s savings if they will let him live there too. The three make a pact to let no one else know of their plan. Slim returns to the bunkhouse, berating Curley for his suspicions. Curley, searching for an easy target for his anger, finds Lennie and picks a fight with him. Lennie crushes Curley’s hand in the altercation. Slim warns Curley that if he tries to get George and Lennie fired, he will be the laughingstock of the farm.
The next night, most of the men go to the local brothel. Lennie is left with Crooks, the lonely, Black stable-hand, and Candy. Curley’s wife flirts with them, refusing to leave until the other men come home. She notices the cuts on Lennie’s face and suspects that he, and not a piece of machinery as Curley claimed, is responsible for hurting her husband. This thought amuses her. The next day, Lennie accidentally kills his puppy in the barn. Curley’s wife enters and consoles him. She admits that life with Curley is a disappointment, and wishes that she had followed her dream of becoming a movie star. Lennie tells her that he loves petting soft things, and she offers to let him feel her hair. When he grabs too tightly, she cries out. In his attempt to silence her, he accidentally breaks her neck.
Lennie flees back to a pool of the Salinas River that George had designated as a meeting place should either of them get into trouble. As the men back at the ranch discover what has happened and gather together a lynch party, George joins Lennie. Much to Lennie’s surprise, George is not mad at him for doing “a bad thing.” George begins to tell Lennie the story of the farm they will have together. As he describes the rabbits that Lennie will tend, the sound of the approaching lynch party grows louder. George shoots his friend in the back of the head.
When the other men arrive, George lets them believe that Lennie had the gun, and George wrestled it away from him and shot him. Only Slim understands what has really happened, that George has killed his friend out of mercy. Slim consolingly leads him away, and the other men, completely puzzled, watch them leave."
Convictions,"Lawyer Bryan Stevenson gives a first-person account of his decades helping marginalized Americans who have been unfairly and harshly punished by the U.S. criminal justice system, which disproportionately targets people of color and poor people. At the heart of Just Mercy is the story of Walter McMillian, a Black man who was framed for the murder of a girl named Ronda Morrison, convicted, and sent to death row. 
Stevenson alternates chapters about Walter with his personal reflections on our country’s history with racial disparity and issues around incarceration. Stevenson highlights other groups of vulnerable people who have been victimized by the criminal justice system and shares the stories of the prisoners he has helped over the years. The book also follows the growth of Stevenson’s nonprofit law project, the Alabama-based Equal Justice Initiative (EJI), through its expansion from focusing on death row prisoners to helping people sentenced to life without parole. Stevenson chronicles how EJI becomes a significant force in criminal justice reform.
In 1983 as a law student, Stevenson discovers his life’s passion when he interns with the Georgia-based Southern Prisoners Defense Committee and meets his first death row prisoner. After graduation Stevenson accepts a job with the organization to represent poor prisoners, including those in Alabama who lack any public defender. He meets Walter McMillian on Alabama’s death row. Walter owns a successful business but also transgresses racial boundaries when he has an affair with a white woman. Soon after the affair becomes public, the woman’s friend, Ralph Myers, accuses Walter of committing the unsolved murder of Ronda Morrison, which has outraged the community. Law enforcement, including a racist sheriff and the district attorney, eagerly pounces on this accusation, overlooking Walter’s alibi and a lack of evidence. Instead, they actively force Ralph to stick with his story even when he tries to recant. They coerce other false witness testimonies, and—as revealed years later—actively suppress evidence.
After Stevenson and the team at EJI unsuccessfully appeal Walter’s conviction, they launch their own investigation of the crime and uncover new evidence. They find witnesses who can prove the witnesses against Walter lied as well as financial records that indicate that one of these witnesses was paid to give false testimony. Stevenson and his team also petition for and receive all records from Walter’s trial. However, their big break comes when they receive a phone call from Ralph, who now wants to make amends. Ralph admits to lying about Walter and says he was threatened by law enforcement. Stevenson wins a hearing for Walter where he can present his new evidence: Ralph’s testimony, which is confirmed by health care workers and other inmates, as well as recordings of the law enforcement team threatening Ralph if he doesn’t frame Walter. 
While the judge refuses to grant Walter relief, Stevenson continues the appeal process through the Alabama courts. The district attorney asks outside agents to investigate the murder for which Walter was convicted, and the investigators determine that Walter had nothing to do with the crime. Six weeks later, the court invalidates Walter’s conviction. Stevenson and the State file a joint motion to dismiss the charges, and Walter is set free.
Throughout the process, Stevenson and Walter become close friends, and Stevenson helps Walter upon his release, including filing a civil suit on his behalf and offering him a place to stay. Walter works with Stevenson to share his story, giving interviews and speaking at legal conferences, and Walter is even featured in a documentary. Unfortunately, Walter is diagnosed with advancing dementia and is forced to rely on family and eventually a nursing facility for his care. He dies in 2013. Stevenson gives a eulogy at his funeral and shares all he learned from Walter, particularly that we must extend mercy to everyone, even those who have not earned it.
Interspersed with chapters chronicling Walter’s narrative are stories of Stevenson’s other clients and work. His closeness with these prisoners and their horrifying circumstances makes Stevenson more determined to help and causes him to reflect on abstract issues that nevertheless imbue the criminal justice system, like humanity and mercy. Stevenson focuses on several categories of vulnerable people who become trapped in the system, including mentally ill prisoners, disabled prisoners, and poor women who give birth to stillborn babies. 
Stevenson and his team at EJI also become increasingly focused on juvenile offenders who are sometimes tried as adults despite their young age. These offenders may be given de facto death sentences by being sentenced to life without parole and face perilous circumstances when they are housed in adult prisons. Stevenson illustrates how these prisoners retain their own humanity while being forced to live under inhumane conditions. He also discusses some of the qualities common among these types of prisoners: They are generally poor and disproportionately people of color, and most of them lack adequate legal counsel. The juveniles have horrific backgrounds of abuse and neglect.
Stevenson and his team at EJI also work to change the legal system to offer more protection to marginalized people. Several of his cases end up before the U.S. Supreme Court, and he succeeds in winning rulings that ban as unconstitutional the conviction of children to life without parole and the execution of people deemed incompetent from dementia or neurological disease. EJI works to raise public awareness of issues surrounding unfair incarceration, produces groundbreaking reports on racial issues, and sets up programs to help formerly incarcerated people adjust to life on the outside.
Stevenson also reflects on the issues that surround the criminal justice system. His time spent with prisoners awaiting their execution makes him realize how inhumane it is to prepare another human to die. After decades of work, when Stevenson fails to prevent the execution of a man who suffers from an intellectual disability, he momentarily feels unable to continue his work. However, he realizes that he cannot help but be broken by his experiences and comes to understand that it is his own brokenness that allows him to more fully understand the need for mercy and to bring compassion to others. The book ends with Stevenson’s renewed commitment to helping others."
Idle,"Stephen Dedalus spends the early morning hours of June 16, 1904, remaining aloof from his mocking friend, Buck Mulligan, and Buck’s English acquaintance, Haines. As Stephen leaves for work, Buck orders him to leave the house key and meet them at the pub at 12:30. Stephen resents Buck.
	Around 10:00 A.M., Stephen teaches a history lesson to his class at Garrett Deasy’s boys’ school. After class, Stephen meets with Deasy to receive his wages. The narrow-minded and prejudiced Deasy lectures Stephen on life. Stephen agrees to take Deasy’s editorial letter about cattle disease to acquaintances at the newspaper. 
	Stephen spends the remainder of his morning walking alone on Sandymount Strand, thinking critically about his younger self and about perception. He composes a poem in his head and writes it down on a scrap torn from Deasy’s letter. 
	At 8:00 A.M. the same morning, Leopold Bloom fixes breakfast and brings his wife her mail and breakfast in bed. One of her letters is from Molly’s concert tour manager, Blazes Boylan (Bloom suspects he is also Molly’s lover)—Boylan will visit at 4:00 this afternoon. Bloom returns downstairs, reads a letter from their daughter, Milly, then goes to the outhouse. 
	At 10:00 A.M., Bloom picks up an amorous letter from the post office—he is corresponding with a woman named Martha Clifford under the pseudonym Henry Flower. He reads the tepid letter, ducks briefly into a church, then orders Molly’s lotion from the pharmacist. He runs into Bantam Lyons, who mistakenly gets the impression that Bloom is giving him a tip on the horse Throwaway in the afternoon’s Gold Cup race.
	Around 11:00 A.M., Bloom rides with Simon Dedalus (Stephen’s father), Martin Cunningham, and Jack Power to the funeral of Paddy Dignam. The men treat Bloom as somewhat of an outsider. At the funeral, Bloom thinks about the deaths of his son and his father.
	At noon, we find Bloom at the offices of the Freeman newspaper, negotiating an advertisement for Keyes, a liquor merchant. Several idle men, including editor Myles Crawford, are hanging around in the office, discussing political speeches. Bloom leaves to secure the ad. Stephen arrives at the newspaper with Deasy’s letter. Stephen and the other men leave for the pub just as Bloom is returning. Bloom’s ad negotiation is rejected by Crawford on his way out.
	At 1:00 P.M., Bloom runs into Josie Breen, an old flame, and they discuss Mina Purefoy, who is in labor at the maternity hospital. Bloom stops in Burton’s restaurant, but he decides to move on to Davy Byrne’s for a light lunch. Bloom reminisces about an intimate afternoon with Molly on Howth. Bloom leaves and is walking toward the National Library when he spots Boylan on the street and ducks into the National Museum.
	At 2:00 P.M., Stephen is informally presenting his “Hamlet theory” in the National Library to the poet A.E. and the librarians John Eglinton, Best, and Lyster. A.E. is dismissive of Stephen’s theory and leaves. Buck enters and jokingly scolds Stephen for failing to meet him and Haines at the pub. On the way out, Buck and Stephen pass Bloom, who has come to obtain a copy of Keyes’ ad.
	At 4:00 P.M., Simon Dedalus, Ben Dollard, Lenehan, and Blazes Boylan converge at the Ormond Hotel bar. Bloom notices Boylan’s car outside and decides to watch him. Boylan soon leaves for his appointment with Molly, and Bloom sits morosely in the Ormond restaurant—he is briefly mollified by Dedalus’s and Dollard’s singing. Bloom writes back to Martha, then leaves to post the letter.
	At 5:00 P.M., Bloom arrives at Barney Kiernan’s pub to meet Martin Cunningham about the Dignam family finances, but Cunningham has not yet arrived. The citizen, a belligerent Irish nationalist, becomes increasingly drunk and begins attacking Bloom’s Jewishness. Bloom stands up to the citizen, speaking in favor of peace and love over xenophobic violence. Bloom and the citizen have an altercation on the street before Cunningham’s carriage carries Bloom away.
	Bloom relaxes on Sandymount Strand around sunset, after his visit to Mrs. Dignam’s house nearby. A young woman, Gerty MacDowell, notices Bloom watching her from across the beach. Gerty subtly reveals more and more of her legs while Bloom surreptitiously masturbates. Gerty leaves, and Bloom dozes. 
	At 10:00 P.M., Bloom wanders to the maternity hospital to check on Mina Purefoy. Also at the hospital are Stephen and several of his medi-c-al student friends, drinking and talking boisterously about subjects related to birth. Bloom agrees to join them, though he privately disapproves of their revelry in light of Mrs. Purefoy’s struggles upstairs. Buck arrives, and the men proceed to Burke’s pub. At closing time, Stephen convinces his friend Lynch to go to the brothel section of town and Bloom follows, feeling protective.
	Bloom finally locates Stephen and Lynch at Bella Cohen’s brothel. Stephen is drunk and imagines that he sees the ghost of his mother—full of rage, he shatters a lamp with his walking stick. Bloom runs after Stephen and finds him in an argument with a British soldier who knocks him out.
	Bloom revives Stephen and takes him for coffee at a cabman’s shelter to sober up. Bloom invites Stephen back to his house.
	Well after midnight, Stephen and Bloom arrive back at Bloom’s house. They drink cocoa and talk about their respective backgrounds. Bloom asks Stephen to stay the night. Stephen politely refuses. Bloom sees him out and comes back in to find evidence of Boylan’s visit. Still, Bloom is at peace with the world and he climbs into bed, tells Molly of his day and requests breakfast in bed. 
After Bloom falls asleep, Molly remains awake, surprised by Bloom’s request for breakfast in bed. Her mind wanders to her childhood in Gibraltar, her afternoon of sex with Boylan, her singing career, Stephen Dedalus. Her thoughts of Bloom vary wildly over the course of the monologue, but it ends with a reminiscence of their intimate moment at Howth and a positive affirmation."
Plays,"The Glass Menagerie is a memory play, and its action is drawn from the memories of the narrator, Tom Wingfield. Tom is a character in the play, which is set in St. Louis in 1937. He is an aspiring poet who toils in a shoe warehouse to support his mother, Amanda, and sister, Laura. Mr. Wingfield, Tom and Laura’s father, ran off years ago and, except for one postcard, has not been heard from since.
Amanda, originally from a genteel Southern family, regales her children frequently with tales of her idyllic youth and the scores of suitors who once pursued her. She is disappointed that Laura, who wears a brace on her leg and is painfully shy, does not attract any gentlemen callers. She enrolls Laura in a business college, hoping that she will make her own and the family’s fortune through a business career. Weeks later, however, Amanda discovers that Laura’s crippling shyness has led her to drop out of the class secretly and spend her days wandering the city alone. Amanda then decides that Laura’s last hope must lie in marriage and begins selling magazine subscriptions to earn the extra money she believes will help to attract suitors for Laura. Meanwhile, Tom, who loathes his warehouse job, finds escape in liquor, movies, and literature, much to his mother’s chagrin. During one of the frequent arguments between mother and son, Tom accidentally breaks several of the glass animal figurines that are Laura’s most prized possessions.
Amanda and Tom discuss Laura’s prospects, and Amanda asks Tom to keep an eye out for potential suitors at the warehouse. Tom selects Jim O’Connor, a casual friend, and invites him to dinner. Amanda quizzes Tom about Jim and is delighted to learn that he is a driven young man with his mind set on career advancement. She prepares an elaborate dinner and insists that Laura wear a new dress. At the last minute, Laura learns the name of her caller; as it turns out, she had a devastating crush on Jim in high school. When Jim arrives, Laura answers the door, on Amanda’s orders, and then quickly disappears, leaving Tom and Jim alone. Tom confides to Jim that he has used the money for his family’s electric bill to join the merchant marine and plans to leave his job and family in search of adventure. Laura refuses to eat dinner with the others, feigning illness. Amanda, wearing an ostentatious dress from her glamorous youth, talks vivaciously with Jim throughout the meal.
As dinner is ending, the lights go out as a consequence of the unpaid electric bill. The characters light candles, and Amanda encourages Jim to entertain Laura in the living room while she and Tom clean up. Laura is at first paralyzed by Jim’s presence, but his warm and open behavior soon draws her out of her shell. She confesses that she knew and liked him in high school but was too shy to approach him. They continue talking, and Laura reminds him of the nickname he had given her: “Blue Roses,” an accidental corruption of pleurosis, an illness Laura had in high school. He reproaches her for her shyness and low self-esteem but praises her uniqueness. Laura then ventures to show him her favorite glass animal, a unicorn. Jim dances with her, but in the process, he accidentally knocks over the unicorn, breaking off its horn. Laura is forgiving, noting that now the unicorn is a normal horse. Jim then kisses her, but he quickly draws back and apologizes, explaining that he was carried away by the moment and that he actually has a serious girlfriend. Resigned, Laura offers him the broken unicorn as a souvenir.
Amanda enters the living room, full of good cheer. Jim hastily explains that he must leave because of an appointment with his fiancée. Amanda sees him off warmly but, after he is gone, turns on Tom, who had not known that Jim was engaged. Amanda accuses Tom of being an inattentive, selfish dreamer and then throws herself into comforting Laura. From the fire escape outside of their apartment, Tom watches the two women and explains that, not long after Jim’s visit, he gets fired from his job and leaves Amanda and Laura behind. Years later, though he travels far, he finds that he is unable to leave behind guilty memories of Laura."
Risen,"A Raisin in the Sun portrays a few weeks in the life of the Youngers, a Black family living on the South Side of Chicago in the 1950s. When the play opens, the Youngers are about to receive an insurance check for $10,000. This money comes from the deceased Mr. Younger’s life insurance policy. Each of the adult members of the family has an idea as to what he or she would like to do with this money. The matriarch of the family, Mama, wants to buy a house to fulfill a dream she shared with her husband. Mama’s son, Walter Lee, would rather use the money to invest in a liquor store with his friends. He believes that the investment will solve the family’s financial problems forever. Walter’s wife, Ruth, agrees with Mama, however, and hopes that she and Walter can provide more space and opportunity for their son, Travis. Finally, Beneatha, Walter’s sister and Mama’s daughter, wants to use the money for her medical school tuition. She also wishes that her family members were not so interested in assimilating into the white world. Beneatha instead tries to find her identity by looking back to the past and to Africa.
As the play progresses, the Youngers clash over their competing dreams. Ruth discovers that she is pregnant but fears that if she has the child, she will put more financial pressure on her family members. When Walter says nothing to Ruth’s admission that she is considering abortion, Mama puts a down payment on a house for the whole family. She believes that a bigger, brighter dwelling will help them all. This house is in Clybourne Park, an entirely white neighborhood. When the Youngers’ future neighbors find out that the Youngers are moving in, they send Mr. Lindner, from the Clybourne Park Improvement Association, to offer the Youngers money in return for staying away. The Youngers refuse the deal, even after Walter loses the rest of the money ($6,500) to his friend Willy Harris, who persuades Walter to invest in the liquor store and then runs off with his cash.
In the meantime, Beneatha rejects her suitor, George Murchison, whom she believes to be shallow and blind to the problems of race. Subsequently, she receives a marriage proposal from her Nigerian boyfriend, Joseph Asagai, who wants Beneatha to get a medical degree and move to Africa with him (Beneatha does not make her choice before the end of the play). The Youngers eventually move out of the apartment, fulfilling the family’s long-held dream. Their future seems uncertain and slightly dangerous, but they are optimistic and determined to live a better life. They believe that they can succeed if they stick together as a family and resolve to defer their dreams no longer."
Governmental,"In Common Sense, Thomas Paine argues for American independence. His argument begins with more general, theoretical reflections about government and religion, then progresses onto the specifics of the colonial situation.
Paine begins by distinguishing between government and society. Society, according to Paine, is everything constructive and good that people join together to accomplish. Government, on the other hand, is an institution whose sole purpose is to protect us from our own vices. Government has its origins in the evil of man and is therefore a necessary evil at best. Paine says that government's sole purpose is to protect life, liberty and property, and that a government should be judged solely on the basis of the extent to which it accomplishes this goal.
Paine then considers an imagined scenario in which a small group of people has been placed on an island, and cut off from the rest of society. In time, these people develop ties with one another, and lawmaking becomes inevitable. Paine says the people will be much happier if they are responsible for the creation of the laws that rule them. Paine is also implicitly arguing that such a system of representation is also better for the American colonists. Having expressed his disagreement with British reign in America, Paine proceeds to launch a general attack on the British system of government. Paine says the British system is too complex and rife with contradictions, and that the monarchy is granted far too much power. The British system pretends to offer a reasonable system of checks and balances, but in fact, it does not.
From here Paine moves on to discuss, in general, the notions of monarchy and hereditary succession. Man, Pain argues, was born into a state of equality, and the distinction that has arisen between king and subject is an unnatural one. At first, Paine says, the world was without kings, but the ancient Jews decided they wanted a king. This angered God, but he allowed them to have one. Paine presents pages of biblical evidence detailing God's wrath at the idea of the Jews having a king. The conclusion Paine reaches is that the practice of monarchy originates from sin, and is an institution that the Bible and God condemn. Paine calls hereditary succession an abominable practice. He says that even if people were to choose to have a king, that does not legitimize that King's child acting as a future ruler. Furthermore, hereditary succession has brought with it innumerable evils, such as incompetent kings, corruption, and civil war.
Having dispensed with the preliminary theoretical issues, Paine sets in to discuss the details of the American situation. In response to the argument that America has flourished under British rule, and therefore ought to stay under the king, Paine says that such an argument fails to realize that America has evolved and no longer needs Britain's help. Some say that Britain has protected America, and therefore deserves allegiance, but Paine responds that Britain has only watched over America in order to secure its own economic well-being. Paine adds that most recently, instead of watching over the colonies, the British have been attacking them, and are therefore undeserving of American loyalty.
Paine says that the colonies have little to gain from remaining attached to Britain. Commerce can be better conducted with the rest of Europe, but only after America becomes independent. Paine also asserts that if the colonies remain attached to Britain, the same problems that have arisen in the past will arise in the future. Paine argues that it is necessary to seek independence now, as to do otherwise would only briefly cover up problems that will surely reemerge.
Paine even proposes the form of government that the independent colonies should adopt. His recommendation is for a representative democracy that gives roughly equal weight to each of the colonies.
Paine explains why the current time is a good time to break free of Britain. Primarily, Paine focuses on the present size of the colonies, and on their current capabilities. He presents an inventory of the British Navy and gives calculations revealing how America could build a navy of comparable size. Paine recommends this as a way of ensuring America's security and prosperity in trade. Paine also argues that America is sufficiently small as to be united now. If time were to elapse, and the population of the colonies to grow, the same feeling of unity would not be present. Paine adds that if the Americans revolt now, they can use the vast expanses of uncharted land to the West in order to pay down some of the debt they will incur.
Paine says that as a colony of Britain, America lacks respectability on the international scene. They are seen simply as rebels, and cannot form substantial alliances with other nations. In order to prosper in the long term, the colonies need to be independent. Paine says that, by declaring independence, America will be able to ask for the help of other countries in its struggle for freedom. For all of these reasons, Paine says it is imperative and urgent that the colonies declare independence."
Smiled,"The Unbearable Lightness of Being opens with a philosophical discussion of lightness versus heaviness. Kundera contrasts Nietzsche's philosophy of eternal return, or of heaviness, with Parmenides's understanding of life as light. Kundera wonders if any meaning or weight can be attributed to life, since there is no eternal return: if man only has the opportunity to try one path, to make one decision, he cannot return to take a different path, and then compare the two lives. Without the ability to co mpare lives, Kundera argues, we cannot find meaning; where meaning should exist we find only an unbearable weightlessness. The uncertain existence of meaning, and the opposition of lightness and heaviness, the key dichotomy of The Unbearable Lightness of Being, sets the stage for the entire novel.
The year is 1968. The protagonist, Tomas, a brilliant Prague surgeon, pursues a philosophy of lightness in his erotic adventures and exploits. Briefly married in the past, he neither sees nor wishes to see his ex-wife or young son and is comfortably established as a perpetual bachelor. He meets Tereza, a café waitress in a town he visits, and realizes when she follows him to Prague that she intends to ""offer him up her life."" A determined libertine, he momentarily resists his budding roma ntic feelings for her, then gives in to his love.
Tereza had been living a frustrated life as a waitress in a small town, and dreamed of escaping, especially from her vulgar mother. She recognizes in Tomas an intellectual and dreamer, and falls in love with him instantly. The two live together, but Tomas is unable to give up his mistresses. For a while he hides his infidelity from Teresa. Eventually he admits to it, but claims that his sexuality is entirely separate from his love for her. Tereza, unable to accept his behavior or adopt a light attitud e towards sex, suffers increasingly from nightmares, and contemplates suicide.
To keep Tereza happy, Tomas marries her. He keeps his mistresses, however, including his closest friend and long-term lover Sabina, a beautiful, reckless, and talented painter. In spite of herself, Tereza is charmed by Sabina's openness and light-heartedness, and the two women grow friendly. Sabina finds Tereza a job in Prague as a photographer. Despite her friendship with Sabina, however, Tereza's jealousy of Tomas does not slacken.
The events of the Prague Spring result in the Soviet military occupation of the city. Tomas, who in the past wrote an article condemning the Czech Communists, is warned to leave. Sabina flees first, and later Tomas and Tereza join her in Switzerland. Tereza, who found some fulfillment in her job as photographer in Prague, realizes that in Zurich she is jobless and must sit at home while Tomas continues having affairs. She decides that ""when the strong were too weak to hurt the weak, the weak had to be strong enough to leave,"" and returns to Prague. Tomas attempts to enjoy his newly recovered freedom for a few days, then gives up and returns to Prague and Tereza. The return truly means giving up freedom—there is no chance that the couple will be allo wed to leave again. In Prague, Tomas's political troubles escalate. He loses his position as surgeon for refusing to sign a denunciation of his anti-Communist article. Both the Communist regime and underground dissidents attempt to seduce him to their side. His own son reappears as a young dissident and preaches to Tomas with no success, for Tomas hates the idea of being used politically in the same way Sabina hates artistic kitsch. In the end, Tomas seeks obscurity in a job washing windows. His fame persists, however, and he continues seducing the women he works for.
Tereza, now a bartender, in a moment of desperation has an affair with a tall engineer who comes to her bar. She does so in hopes of coming closer to Tomas's way of life; instead she grows more miserable and becomes convinced the man was a police agent hired to gather potential blackmailing material. After many scenes and nightmares, she convinces Tomas to move with her to the country. This means giving up their way of life entirely, and an end to Tomas's erotic adventures.
After living peacefully in the country for some time, Tomas and Tereza are killed one night in a driving accident; they die instantly and together.
In Geneva, Sabina has a love affair with Franz, a university professor and idealistic intellectual who has more in common emotionally with Tereza than Sabina—he imbues his life with heavy meaning. He views Sabina as a romantic and courageous Czech dissident, and is tortured that he must betray his wife Marie-Claude in order to see her. Sabina loves Franz but their views on betrayal differ dramatically; whereas he hates the idea of betrayal, she views betrayal as the first step towards ""going off into the unknown,"" the most glorious thing she can think of.
When Franz leaves his wife and expects to move in with her, Sabina abruptly leaves Switzerland. Sabina leaves Geneva for Paris and then Paris for America; she learns of Tomas and Tereza's deaths from a letter and understands her last link to the past has been broken. She ends up living with an elderly American couple and wondering if she has reached the end of her perpetual flight.
Franz remains separated from his wife. After Sabina's betrayal, he finds consolation with a young student, a girl in over-sized glasses who loves him simply. Franz never accepts that he clearly misunderstood Sabina, but continues to hold her image as in ideal in his head, (wrongly) thinking his decisions in life would have made her proud. At his death, his wife reclaims Franz's body and orders the words ""A return after long wanderings"" written on his tombstone."
Simple,"Two migrant workers, George and Lennie, have been let off a bus miles away from the California farm where they are due to start work. George is a small, dark man with “sharp, strong features.” Lennie, his companion, is his opposite, a giant of a man with a “shapeless” face. Overcome with thirst, the two stop in a clearing by a pool and decide to camp for the night. As the two converse, it becomes clear that Lennie has an intellectual disability, and is deeply devoted to George and dependent upon him for protection and guidance. George finds that Lennie, who loves petting soft things but often accidentally kills them, has been carrying and stroking a dead mouse. George angrily throws it away, fearing that Lennie might catch a disease from the dead animal. George complains loudly that his life would be easier without having to care for Lennie, but the reader senses that their friendship and devotion is mutual. He and Lennie share a dream of buying their own piece of land, farming it, and, much to Lennie’s delight, keeping rabbits. George ends the night by treating Lennie to the story he often tells him about what life will be like in such an idyllic place.
The next day, the men report to the nearby ranch. George, fearing how the boss will react to Lennie, insists that he’ll do all the talking. He lies, explaining that they travel together because they are cousins and that a horse kicked Lennie in the head when he was a child. They are hired. They meet Candy, an old “swamper,” or handyman, with a missing hand and an ancient dog, and Curley, the boss’s mean-spirited son. Curley is newly married, possessive of his flirtatious wife, and full of jealous suspicion. Once George and Lennie are alone in the bunkhouse, Curley’s wife appears and flirts with them. Lennie thinks she is “purty,” but George, sensing the trouble that could come from tangling with this woman and her husband, warns Lennie to stay away from her. Soon, the ranch-hands return from the fields for lunch, and George and Lennie meet Slim, the skilled mule driver who wields great authority on the ranch. Slim comments on the rarity of friendship like that between George and Lennie. Carlson, another ranch-hand, suggests that since Slim’s dog has just given birth, they should offer a puppy to Candy and shoot Candy’s old, good-for-nothing dog.
The next day, George confides in Slim that he and Lennie are not cousins, but have been friends since childhood. He tells how Lennie has often gotten them into trouble. For instance, they were forced to flee their last job because Lennie tried to touch a woman’s dress and was accused of rape. Slim agrees to give Lennie one of his puppies, and Carlson continues to badger Candy to kill his old dog. When Slim agrees with Carlson, saying that death would be a welcome relief to the suffering animal, Candy gives in. Carlson, before leading the dog outside, promises to do the job painlessly.
Slim goes to the barn to do some work, and Curley, who is maniacally searching for his wife, heads to the barn to accost Slim. Candy overhears George and Lennie discussing their plans to buy land, and offers his life’s savings if they will let him live there too. The three make a pact to let no one else know of their plan. Slim returns to the bunkhouse, berating Curley for his suspicions. Curley, searching for an easy target for his anger, finds Lennie and picks a fight with him. Lennie crushes Curley’s hand in the altercation. Slim warns Curley that if he tries to get George and Lennie fired, he will be the laughingstock of the farm.
The next night, most of the men go to the local brothel. Lennie is left with Crooks, the lonely, Black stable-hand, and Candy. Curley’s wife flirts with them, refusing to leave until the other men come home. She notices the cuts on Lennie’s face and suspects that he, and not a piece of machinery as Curley claimed, is responsible for hurting her husband. This thought amuses her. The next day, Lennie accidentally kills his puppy in the barn. Curley’s wife enters and consoles him. She admits that life with Curley is a disappointment, and wishes that she had followed her dream of becoming a movie star. Lennie tells her that he loves petting soft things, and she offers to let him feel her hair. When he grabs too tightly, she cries out. In his attempt to silence her, he accidentally breaks her neck.
Lennie flees back to a pool of the Salinas River that George had designated as a meeting place should either of them get into trouble. As the men back at the ranch discover what has happened and gather together a lynch party, George joins Lennie. Much to Lennie’s surprise, George is not mad at him for doing “a bad thing.” George begins to tell Lennie the story of the farm they will have together. As he describes the rabbits that Lennie will tend, the sound of the approaching lynch party grows louder. George shoots his friend in the back of the head.
When the other men arrive, George lets them believe that Lennie had the gun, and George wrestled it away from him and shot him. Only Slim understands what has really happened, that George has killed his friend out of mercy. Slim consolingly leads him away, and the other men, completely puzzled, watch them leave."
Correctives,"A youth named Equality 7-2521, who has found a hidden tunnel and hides in it to write, knows his solitude violates all the laws of his society. Even though he does not feel guilt for his actions, he begs the forgiveness of the ruling Council. As he spends more time alone, he realizes that solitude suits him, and he begins to crave more and more time by himself. From his tunnel, Equality 7-2521 records episodes from his childhood. As a child, Equality 7-2521 wanted more than anything to be a scholar. He believed he was cursed with a terrific curiosity, which made him prefer some things to others and to prefer some people to others. He often fought with the boys at the Home of Students, and he was reprimanded by his teachers for being too smart and too tall. He tried to conform to the standard the others set, but no matter how hard he tried, he was smarter and quicker than they were. When the Council of Vocations assigned him to be a street sweeper instead of a scholar, he was pleased because it meant he could atone for the sins he had committed.
When he was ten, Equality 7-2521 saw the public execution of the Transgressor of the Unspeakable Word, who had discovered the word “I” and was burned to death in the town square as punishment for using the word. While he was burning, the Transgressor showed no pain but locked eyes with Equality 7-2521. Equality 7-2521 comes to believe that that moment anointed him as a disciple of the same crusade as the Transgressor.
Equality 7-2521 begins to conduct experiments and shortly discovers electricity. After many weeks of work, he successfully builds a lightbulb from the materials he finds in his tunnel. He decides that he must share his invention with the world and resolves to present it to the World Council of Scholars when it convenes that year in his city.
In the meantime, Equality 7-2521 has met the Golden One, a beautiful peasant girl who is proud and haughty. He knows it is wrong to do so, but he speaks to her when he gets the chance, and they immediately fall in love. One day, she offers him some water from her hands, and he drinks it, not understanding why this act makes him think of the Palace of Mating, where he and all other mature citizens are sent once a year to have sex.
Before he can show the lightbulb to the World Council, Equality 7-2521 accidentally returns late to the Home of the Street Sweepers, where he lives. When he refuses to tell his Home Council where he has been, he is thrown into the Palace of Corrective Detention. There he is tortured, but he still refuses to tell where he has been, because he wants to keep the lightbulb a secret until he gets to show it to the World Council. He remains incarcerated until the World Council convenes, when he breaks out of the Palace of Corrective Detention and goes to the World Council, expecting to be exonerated and reconciled with his brothers.
When Equality 7-2521 arrives and tells the World Council his story, however, the World Council rejects him out of fear and anger. It threatens to kill him and to get rid of his lightbulb. He cannot abide having his lightbulb destroyed, so he grabs his invention and flees the city. He runs to the Uncharted Forest where he discovers that he is free at last to do as he pleases.
A few days later, the Golden One appears. She has followed Equality 7-2521 into the woods. They vow to live together in peace and solitude. After they have been hiking for several days in the mountains, they find an abandoned house from the Unmentionable Times. The Golden One revels in the finery she finds in the house, and Equality 7-2521 consumes the library. He discovers the meaning of the word “I,” and he vows to protect his home and from there launch a new race of men who will believe in individualism and the never-ending supremacy of the ego."
Our,"Our Town is introduced and narrated by the Stage Manager, who welcomes the audience to the fictional town of Grover’s Corners, New Hampshire, early on a May morning in 1901. In the opening scene, the stage is largely empty, except for some tables and chairs that represent the homes of the Gibbs and Webb families, the setting of most of the action in Act I. The set remains sparse throughout the rest of the play.
	After the Stage Manager’s introduction, the activities of a typical day begin. Howie Newsome, the milkman, and Joe Crowell, Jr., the paperboy, make their delivery rounds. Dr. Gibbs returns from delivering a set of twins at one of the homes in town. Mrs. Gibbs and Mrs. Webb make breakfast, send their children off to school, and meet in their gardens to gossip. The two women also discuss their modest ambitions, and Mrs. Gibbs reveals that she longs to visit Paris.
Throughout the play, the characters pantomime their activities and chores. When Howie makes his milk deliveries, for example, no horse appears onstage despite the fact that he frequently addresses his horse as “Bessie.” Howie does not actually hold anything in his hands, but he pantomimes carrying bottles of milk, and the sound of clinking milk bottles comes from offstage. This deliberate abandonment of props goes hand in hand with the minimal set.
	The Stage Manager interrupts the action. He calls Professor Willard and then Mr. Webb out onto the stage to tell the audience some basic facts about Grover’s Corners. Mr. Webb not only reports to the audience, but also takes questions from some “audience members” who are actually characters in the play seated in the audience.
Afternoon arrives, school lets out, and George Gibbs meets his neighbor Emily Webb outside the gate of her house. We see the first inkling of George and Emily’s romantic affection for one another during this scene and during Emily’s subsequent conversation with her mother. The Stage Manager thanks and dismisses Emily and Mrs. Webb, then launches into a discussion of a time capsule that will be placed in the foundation of a new bank building in town. He tells us that he wishes to put a copy of Our Town into this time capsule.
	Now evening, a choir in the orchestra pit begins to sing “Blessed Be the Tie That Binds.” The choir, directed by the bitter yet comical choirmaster Simon Stimson, continues to sing as George and Emily talk to each other through their open windows. Mrs. Webb, Mrs. Gibbs, and their gossipy friend Mrs. Soames return home from choir practice and chat about the choirmaster’s alcoholism. The women return to their respective homes. George and his sister Rebecca sit at a window and look outside. Rebecca ponders the position of Grover’s Corners within the vastness of the universe, which she believes is contained within “the Mind of God.” Night has fallen on Grover’s Corners, and the first act comes to an end.
	Act II takes place three years later, on George and Emily’s wedding day. George tries to visit his fiancée, but he is shooed away by Mr. and Mrs. Webb, who insist that it is bad luck for the groom to see the bride-to-be on the wedding day anytime before the ceremony. Mrs. Webb goes upstairs to make sure Emily does not come downstairs. George is left alone with Mr. Webb. The young man and his future father-in-law awkwardly discuss marriage and how to be a virtuous husband.
	The Stage Manager interjects and introduces a flashback to the previous year. George and Emily are on their way home from school. George has just been elected class president and Emily has just been elected secretary and treasurer. George has also become something of a local baseball star. Emily tells George that his popularity has made him “conceited and stuck-up.” George, though hurt, thanks Emily for her honesty, but Emily becomes mortified by her own words and asks George to forget them. The two stop at Mr. Morgan’s drugstore for ice-cream sodas and, over the course of their drink, admit their mutual affection. George decides to scrap his plan of attending agriculture school in favor of staying in Grover’s Corners with Emily.
	We return to the day of the wedding in 1904. Both the bride and groom feel jittery, but their parents calm them down and the ceremony goes ahead as planned. The Stage Manager acts as the clergyman. The newlyweds run out through the audience, and the second act ends with the Stage Manager’s announcement that it is time for another intermission.
	Act III takes place nine years later, in a cemetery on a hilltop overlooking the town. Emily has died in childbirth and is about to be buried. The funeral party occupies the back of the stage. The most prominent characters in this act, the dead souls who already inhabit the cemetery, sit in chairs at the front of the stage. Among the dead are Mrs. Gibbs, Mrs. Soames, Wally Webb, and Simon Stimson. As the funeral takes place, the dead speak, serving as detached witnesses. Death has rendered them largely indifferent to earthly events. Emily joins the dead, but she misses her previous life and decides to go back and relive part of it. The other souls disapprove and advise Emily to stay in the cemetery.
	With the aid of the Stage Manager, Emily steps into the past, revisiting the morning of her twelfth birthday. Howie Newsome and Joe Crowell, Jr. make their deliveries as usual. Mrs. Webb gives her daughter some presents and calls to Mr. Webb. As Emily participates, she also watches the scene as an observer, noting her parents’ youth and beauty. Emily now has a nostalgic appreciation for everyday life that her parents and the other living characters do not share. She becomes agonized by the beauty and transience of everyday life and demands to be taken back to the cemetery. As Emily settles in among the dead souls, George lays prostrate by her tomb. “They don’t understand,” she says of the living. The stars come out over Grover’s Corners, and the play ends."
Covering,"In the midst of a raging war, a plane evacuating a group of schoolboys from Britain is shot down over a deserted tropical island. Two of the boys, Ralph and Piggy, discover a conch shell on the beach, and Piggy realizes it could be used as a horn to summon the other boys. Once assembled, the boys set about electing a leader and devising a way to be rescued. They choose Ralph as their leader, and Ralph appoints another boy, Jack, to be in charge of the boys who will hunt food for the entire group.
Ralph, Jack, and another boy, Simon, set off on an expedition to explore the island. When they return, Ralph declares that they must light a signal fire to attract the attention of passing ships. The boys succeed in igniting some dead wood by focusing sunlight through the lenses of Piggy’s eyeglasses. However, the boys pay more attention to playing than to monitoring the fire, and the flames quickly engulf the forest. A large swath of dead wood burns out of control, and one of the youngest boys in the group disappears, presumably having burned to death.
At first, the boys enjoy their life without grown-ups and spend much of their time splashing in the water and playing games. Ralph, however, complains that they should be maintaining the signal fire and building huts for shelter. The hunters fail in their attempt to catch a wild pig, but their leader, Jack, becomes increasingly preoccupied with the act of hunting.
When a ship passes by on the horizon one day, Ralph and Piggy notice, to their horror, that the signal fire—which had been the hunters’ responsibility to maintain—has burned out. Furious, Ralph accosts Jack, but the hunter has just returned with his first kill, and all the hunters seem gripped with a strange frenzy, reenacting the chase in a kind of wild dance. Piggy criticizes Jack, who hits Piggy across the face. Ralph blows the conch shell and reprimands the boys in a speech intended to restore order. At the meeting, it quickly becomes clear that some of the boys have started to become afraid. The littlest boys, known as “littluns,” have been troubled by nightmares from the beginning, and more and more boys now believe that there is some sort of beast or monster lurking on the island. The older boys try to convince the others at the meeting to think rationally, asking where such a monster could possibly hide during the daytime. One of the littluns suggests that it hides in the sea—a proposition that terrifies the entire group.
Not long after the meeting, some military planes engage in a battle high above the island. The boys, asleep below, do not notice the flashing lights and explosions in the clouds. A parachutist drifts to earth on the signal-fire mountain, dead. Sam and Eric, the twins responsible for watching the fire at night, are asleep and do not see the parachutist land. When the twins wake up, they see the enormous silhouette of his parachute and hear the strange flapping noises it makes. Thinking the island beast is at hand, they rush back to the camp in terror and report that the beast has attacked them.
The boys organize a hunting expedition to search for the monster. Jack and Ralph, who are increasingly at odds, travel up the mountain. They see the silhouette of the parachute from a distance and think that it looks like a huge, deformed ape. The group holds a meeting at which Jack and Ralph tell the others of the sighting. Jack says that Ralph is a coward and that he should be removed from office, but the other boys refuse to vote Ralph out of power. Jack angrily runs away down the beach, calling all the hunters to join him. Ralph rallies the remaining boys to build a new signal fire, this time on the beach rather than on the mountain. They obey, but before they have finished the task, most of them have slipped away to join Jack.
Jack declares himself the leader of the new tribe of hunters and organizes a hunt and a violent, ritual slaughter of a sow to solemnize the occasion. The hunters then decapitate the sow and place its head on a sharpened stake in the jungle as an offering to the beast. Later, encountering the bloody, fly-covered head, Simon has a terrible vision, during which it seems to him that the head is speaking. The voice, which he imagines as belonging to the Lord of the Flies, says that Simon will never escape him, for he exists within all men. Simon faints. When he wakes up, he goes to the mountain, where he sees the dead parachutist. Understanding then that the beast does not exist externally but rather within each individual boy, Simon travels to the beach to tell the others what he has seen. But the others are in the midst of a chaotic revelry—even Ralph and Piggy have joined Jack’s feast—and when they see Simon’s shadowy figure emerge from the jungle, they fall upon him and kill him with their bare hands and teeth.
The following morning, Ralph and Piggy discuss what they have done. Jack’s hunters attack them and their few followers and steal Piggy’s glasses in the process. Ralph’s group travels to Jack’s stronghold in an attempt to make Jack see reason, but Jack orders Sam and Eric tied up and fights with Ralph. In the ensuing battle, one boy, Roger, rolls a boulder down the mountain, killing Piggy and shattering the conch shell. Ralph barely manages to escape a torrent of spears.
Ralph hides for the rest of the night and the following day, while the others hunt him like an animal. Jack has the other boys ignite the forest in order to smoke Ralph out of his hiding place. Ralph stays in the forest, where he discovers and destroys the sow’s head, but eventually, he is forced out onto the beach, where he knows the other boys will soon arrive to kill him. Ralph collapses in exhaustion, but when he looks up, he sees a British naval officer standing over him. The officer’s ship noticed the fire raging in the jungle. The other boys reach the beach and stop in their tracks at the sight of the officer. Amazed at the spectacle of this group of bloodthirsty, savage children, the officer asks Ralph to explain. Ralph is overwhelmed by the knowledge that he is safe but, thinking about what has happened on the island, he begins to weep. The other boys begin to sob as well. The officer turns his back so that the boys may regain their composure."
Barbarian,"The Woman Warrior focuses on the stories of five women—Kingston's long-dead aunt, ""No-Name Woman""; a mythical female warrior, Fa Mu Lan; Kingston's mother, Brave Orchid; Kingston's aunt, Moon Orchid; and finally Kingston herself—told in five chapters. The chapters integrate Kingston's lived experience with a series of talk-stories—spoken stories that combine Chinese history, myths, and beliefs—her mother tells her.
The first chapter, ""No-Name Woman,"" begins with one such talk-story, about an aunt Kingston never knew she had. Because this aunt had brought disgrace upon her family by having an illegitimate child, she killed herself and her baby by jumping into the family well in China. After hearing the story, which is told to her as a warning, Kingston is never allowed to mention her aunt aloud again, so she decides to create a history of her aunt in her memoir. She imagines the ways that her aunt attracted a suitor, comparing her aunt's actions of quiet rebellion against the community to her own rebellion. Kingston also recreates her aunt's horrible experience of giving birth in a pigsty and imagines her aunt's ghost walking around with no one to give it gifts, as was Chinese custom. In the end, Kingston is unsure whether she is doing justice to her aunt's memory or just serving her own needs.
""White Tigers"" is based on another talk-story, one about the mythical female warrior Fa Mu Lan. Fa Mu Lan, whose story is told through Kingston's first-person narrative, trains to become a warrior from the time she is seven years old, then leads an army of men—even pretending to be a man herself—against the forces of a corrupt baron and emperor. After her battles are over, she returns to be a wife and mother. The story of Fa Mu Lan is contrasted sharply with Kingston's own life in America, in which she can barely stand up to her racist bosses. Kingston realizes, however, that her weapons are her words.
""Shaman"" focuses on Kingston's mother, Brave Orchid, and her old life back in China. Brave Orchid was a powerful doctor, midwife, and, according to the talk-story, destroyer of ghosts back in her village. To a young Kingston, Brave Orchid's past is as astounding as it is terrifying, and many of the images from her mother's talk-story—Chinese babies left to die, slave girls being bought and sold, a woman stoned to death by her villagers—haunt Kingston's dreams for years to come. At the end of the chapter, Maxine visits her mother after being away for many years. The two arrive at some kind of understanding after many years of disagreement and conflict, and Brave Orchid is warm and affectionate towards her daughter for the first time in the memoir.
The title of ""At the Western Palace"" refers to another of Brave Orchid's talk-stories, about an emperor who had four wives. It is an analogy for her sister Moon Orchid's situation: Moon Orchid's husband, now a successful Los Angeles doctor, had left her behind in China and remarried in America. Brave Orchid urges her sister into a disastrous confrontation with the man to demand her due as his wife. As a result, Moon Orchid, who does not speak a word of English, is left to fend for herself in America. She eventually becomes insane and dies in a California state mental asylum.
The final chapter of the memoir, ""A Song for a Barbarian Reed Pipe,"" is about Kingston herself. This section focuses mainly on her childhood and teenage years, depicting her anger and frustration in trying to express herself and attempting to please an unappreciative mother. There are a number of characters whose personalities highlight many of her Kingston's own characteristics, including a silent Chinese girl whom Kingston torments as a little girl. In a pivotal moment in the chapter, Kingston, after unsuccessfully trying to express her feelings one at a time, erupts at her mother with a torrent of complaints and criticisms.
Later in her life, however, Kingston comes to appreciate her mother's talk-stories. At the end of the chapter she even tells one herself: the story of Ts'ai Yen, a warrior poetess captured by barbarians who returns to the Chinese with songs from another land. It is a fitting conclusion to a text in which Kingston combines very different worlds and cultures and create a harmony of her own."
Articles,"The Unbearable Lightness of Being opens with a philosophical discussion of lightness versus heaviness. Kundera contrasts Nietzsche's philosophy of eternal return, or of heaviness, with Parmenides's understanding of life as light. Kundera wonders if any meaning or weight can be attributed to life, since there is no eternal return: if man only has the opportunity to try one path, to make one decision, he cannot return to take a different path, and then compare the two lives. Without the ability to co mpare lives, Kundera argues, we cannot find meaning; where meaning should exist we find only an unbearable weightlessness. The uncertain existence of meaning, and the opposition of lightness and heaviness, the key dichotomy of The Unbearable Lightness of Being, sets the stage for the entire novel.
The year is 1968. The protagonist, Tomas, a brilliant Prague surgeon, pursues a philosophy of lightness in his erotic adventures and exploits. Briefly married in the past, he neither sees nor wishes to see his ex-wife or young son and is comfortably established as a perpetual bachelor. He meets Tereza, a café waitress in a town he visits, and realizes when she follows him to Prague that she intends to ""offer him up her life."" A determined libertine, he momentarily resists his budding roma ntic feelings for her, then gives in to his love.
Tereza had been living a frustrated life as a waitress in a small town, and dreamed of escaping, especially from her vulgar mother. She recognizes in Tomas an intellectual and dreamer, and falls in love with him instantly. The two live together, but Tomas is unable to give up his mistresses. For a while he hides his infidelity from Teresa. Eventually he admits to it, but claims that his sexuality is entirely separate from his love for her. Tereza, unable to accept his behavior or adopt a light attitud e towards sex, suffers increasingly from nightmares, and contemplates suicide.
To keep Tereza happy, Tomas marries her. He keeps his mistresses, however, including his closest friend and long-term lover Sabina, a beautiful, reckless, and talented painter. In spite of herself, Tereza is charmed by Sabina's openness and light-heartedness, and the two women grow friendly. Sabina finds Tereza a job in Prague as a photographer. Despite her friendship with Sabina, however, Tereza's jealousy of Tomas does not slacken.
The events of the Prague Spring result in the Soviet military occupation of the city. Tomas, who in the past wrote an article condemning the Czech Communists, is warned to leave. Sabina flees first, and later Tomas and Tereza join her in Switzerland. Tereza, who found some fulfillment in her job as photographer in Prague, realizes that in Zurich she is jobless and must sit at home while Tomas continues having affairs. She decides that ""when the strong were too weak to hurt the weak, the weak had to be strong enough to leave,"" and returns to Prague. Tomas attempts to enjoy his newly recovered freedom for a few days, then gives up and returns to Prague and Tereza. The return truly means giving up freedom—there is no chance that the couple will be allo wed to leave again. In Prague, Tomas's political troubles escalate. He loses his position as surgeon for refusing to sign a denunciation of his anti-Communist article. Both the Communist regime and underground dissidents attempt to seduce him to their side. His own son reappears as a young dissident and preaches to Tomas with no success, for Tomas hates the idea of being used politically in the same way Sabina hates artistic kitsch. In the end, Tomas seeks obscurity in a job washing windows. His fame persists, however, and he continues seducing the women he works for.
Tereza, now a bartender, in a moment of desperation has an affair with a tall engineer who comes to her bar. She does so in hopes of coming closer to Tomas's way of life; instead she grows more miserable and becomes convinced the man was a police agent hired to gather potential blackmailing material. After many scenes and nightmares, she convinces Tomas to move with her to the country. This means giving up their way of life entirely, and an end to Tomas's erotic adventures.
After living peacefully in the country for some time, Tomas and Tereza are killed one night in a driving accident; they die instantly and together.
In Geneva, Sabina has a love affair with Franz, a university professor and idealistic intellectual who has more in common emotionally with Tereza than Sabina—he imbues his life with heavy meaning. He views Sabina as a romantic and courageous Czech dissident, and is tortured that he must betray his wife Marie-Claude in order to see her. Sabina loves Franz but their views on betrayal differ dramatically; whereas he hates the idea of betrayal, she views betrayal as the first step towards ""going off into the unknown,"" the most glorious thing she can think of.
When Franz leaves his wife and expects to move in with her, Sabina abruptly leaves Switzerland. Sabina leaves Geneva for Paris and then Paris for America; she learns of Tomas and Tereza's deaths from a letter and understands her last link to the past has been broken. She ends up living with an elderly American couple and wondering if she has reached the end of her perpetual flight.
Franz remains separated from his wife. After Sabina's betrayal, he finds consolation with a young student, a girl in over-sized glasses who loves him simply. Franz never accepts that he clearly misunderstood Sabina, but continues to hold her image as in ideal in his head, (wrongly) thinking his decisions in life would have made her proud. At his death, his wife reclaims Franz's body and orders the words ""A return after long wanderings"" written on his tombstone."
Noblest,"Winston Smith is a low-ranking member of the ruling Party in London, in the nation of Oceania. Everywhere Winston goes, even his own home, the Party watches him through telescreens; everywhere he looks he sees the face of the Party’s seemingly omniscient leader, a figure known only as Big Brother. The Party controls everything in Oceania, even the people’s history and language. Currently, the Party is forcing the implementation of an invented language called Newspeak, which attempts to prevent political rebellion by eliminating all words related to it. Even thinking rebellious thoughts is illegal. Such thoughtcrime is, in fact, the worst of all crimes.
As the novel opens, Winston feels frustrated by the oppression and rigid control of the Party, which prohibits free thought, sex, and any expression of individuality. Winston dislikes the party and has illegally purchased a diary in which to write his criminal thoughts. He has also become fixated on a powerful Party member named O’Brien, whom Winston believes is a secret member of the Brotherhood—the mysterious, legendary group that works to overthrow the Party.
Winston works in the Ministry of Truth, where he alters historical records to fit the needs of the Party. He notices a coworker, a beautiful dark-haired girl, staring at him, and worries that she is an informant who will turn him in for his thoughtcrime. He is troubled by the Party’s control of history: the Party claims that Oceania has always been allied with Eastasia in a war against Eurasia, but Winston seems to recall a time when this was not true. The Party also claims that Emmanuel Goldstein, the alleged leader of the Brotherhood, is the most dangerous man alive, but this does not seem plausible to Winston. Winston spends his evenings wandering through the poorest neighborhoods in London, where the proletarians, or proles, live squalid lives, relatively free of Party monitoring.
One day, Winston receives a note from the dark-haired girl that reads “I love you.” She tells him her name, Julia, and they begin a covert affair, always on the lookout for signs of Party monitoring. Eventually they rent a room above the secondhand store in the prole district where Winston bought the diary. This relationship lasts for some time. Winston is sure that they will be caught and punished sooner or later (the fatalistic Winston knows that he has been doomed since he wrote his first diary entry), while Julia is more pragmatic and optimistic. As Winston’s affair with Julia progresses, his hatred for the Party grows more and more intense. At last, he receives the message that he has been waiting for: O’Brien wants to see him.
Winston and Julia travel to O’Brien’s luxurious apartment. As a member of the powerful Inner Party (Winston belongs to the Outer Party), O’Brien leads a life of luxury that Winston can only imagine. O’Brien confirms to Winston and Julia that, like them, he hates the Party, and says that he works against it as a member of the Brotherhood. He indoctrinates Winston and Julia into the Brotherhood, and gives Winston a copy of Emmanuel Goldstein’s book, the manifesto of the Brotherhood. Winston reads the book—an amalgam of several forms of class-based twentieth-century social theory—to Julia in the room above the store. Suddenly, soldiers barge in and seize them. Mr. Charrington, the proprietor of the store, is revealed as having been a member of the Thought Police all along.
Torn away from Julia and taken to a place called the Ministry of Love, Winston finds that O’Brien, too, is a Party spy who simply pretended to be a member of the Brotherhood in order to trap Winston into committing an open act of rebellion against the Party. O’Brien spends months torturing and brainwashing Winston, who struggles to resist. At last, O’Brien sends him to the dreaded Room 101, the final destination for anyone who opposes the Party. Here, O’Brien tells Winston that he will be forced to confront his worst fear. Throughout the novel, Winston has had recurring nightmares about rats; O’Brien now straps a cage full of rats onto Winston’s head and prepares to allow the rats to eat his face. Winston snaps, pleading with O’Brien to do it to Julia, not to him.
Giving up Julia is what O’Brien wanted from Winston all along. His spirit broken, Winston is released to the outside world. He meets Julia but no longer feels anything for her. He has accepted the Party entirely and has learned to love Big Brother."
Leave,"A middle-class family, Amanda, Clay, and their teenage children, thirteen-year-old Rose and sixteen-year-old Archie, drive from their home in Brooklyn to a luxurious but remote Airbnb in Long Island for their summer vacation. They swim in the pool, stock up on groceries, and spend a day at the beach, but on the second night, their tranquility is disrupted by the arrival of an older Black couple who claim to own the house, G.H. and Ruth Washington. They also claim there’s been a blackout in New York City. Amanda is suspicious, in large part because Ruth and G. H. are Black, but she and Clay let the couple stay in the basement apartment. 
They awake to four news alerts on Amanda’s phone, the last one in gibberish. The TVs, Internet, and landline don’t work but they still have electricity. In the light of day, Amanda is less suspicious of the Washingtons and they begin to make small talk. It emerges that the Washingtons are wealthy and well-connected. As the adults talk, Rose sees dozens of deer in the woods behind the house, not realizing there are thousands of the animals gathering. Clay offers to drive to town to find out what is going on, but gets lost after stopping to smoke a cigarette. The others gather around the pool as if nothing has happened. The kids play with pool floats, Amanda and Ruth make sandwiches for lunch, and G. H. relaxes in the hot tub. 
Rose and Archie go exploring and find a shed. Archie scares Rose with a story of a sinister man who sleeps in the shed, then they wander into the woods. Meanwhile, Clay is still lost and begins to panic. He comes across a Spanish-speaking woman in evident distress on the road and drives away without helping her. Out in the quiet woods, the children spot another house but don’t approach it. Poolside, Amanda worries that Clay isn’t back. While she and G.H. are talking, an unidentifiable, ear-splitting noise terrifies them all. It is loud enough to make hairline fractures in the house’s plate glass doors. Amanda screams and runs to find her children, who are running home in fear. The noise terrifies Clay and makes him long for the safety of the house. Suddenly, he recognizes his surroundings and sets off for home. When the others ask where he has been, he lies because he is ashamed that he got lost. He doesn’t mention the woman on the roadside or his panic when he couldn’t find his way back to the house. Instead, he says he smoked a cigarette and came home when he heard the noise. 
Archie takes a shower and feels hot and sleepy afterward. It begins to rain, and Rose wishes their vacation could have lasted one more day. Ruth prepares to do laundry and considers asking Amanda to put hers in too, while Rose decides to bake a cake. Amanda asks Clay to fill the bathtubs as an emergency precaution after G. H. confirms that a power outage would mean they can’t get water. They discuss going home or to town but decide to wait. Amanda finds Archie asleep and feverish. He vomits and they decide to take him to their doctor in Brooklyn the next day. That night feels almost like a party, as the adults indulge in lots of food and alcohol. Ruth sees Amanda and Clay almost as friends now, herself as host. Amanda and Clay begin packing, then have sex to feel better. Amanda goes outside naked and G. H., in a swimsuit, joins her in the hot tub. Clay, also naked, brings drinks. A flock of flamingos lands in the yard and the pool, and everyone speculates about what their presence means. They go back inside and hear the terrible noise again. 
Amanda, Clay, and their children huddle in bed together. Amanda and Clay wake up feeling terrible and hungover. Amanda vomits a pinkish fluid and Clay has diarrhea. When Archie wakes up, five of his teeth fall out. Clay consults Ruth and G. H., who agree Archie needs to go to the hospital. Clay doesn’t know the way, so G. H. agrees to go with him even though Ruth wants G. H. to stay with her at the house. Then Amanda notices that Rose is gone. They search for her, but when Archie collapses and starts vomiting pinkish fluid, G. H., Clay, and Archie leave for the hospital. Ruth and Amanda argue as they search for Rose. Afterward, Amanda apologizes to Ruth and wants to hug her but doesn’t. 
Instead of going to the hospital, G. H. drives to the home of Danny, his contractor and supposed friend. Danny thinks a war has broken out and he offers them no help. His harsh demeanor makes it clear that he tolerated G. H. when he was making money from him, but he does not consider him a friend. In Danny’s mind, he dislikes G. H. for the same reasons he dislikes Barack Obama. To G. H.’s disappointment, Danny refuses to help or even to let them inside, but he warns them that the best thing to do is to stay home and wait. Instead of going to the hospital, they decide to return to the house. 
Unaware that people are looking for her, Rose is in the woods on a mission to do something helpful. Following the example set by the books and movies she loves, she believes they shouldn’t panic but prepare. She walks to the house she and Archie found in the woods. When nobody answers the door, she breaks in and explores the place, imagining her family could live there. She puts on a DVD to listen to as she takes stock of the food and other supplies. Then she heads back with a full bag of provisions and news of the vacant house."
August,"Lena Grove, a pregnant teenager, has made her way to Mississippi in search of her baby’s father. She hitches a ride into the small town of Jefferson, which is home to a planing mill. One of the workers at the mill, Joe Christmas, is a brooding, racially ambiguous man who appeared suddenly at the mill one day in search of a job. After gaining employment, he was soon joined at the mill by another man named Joe Brown. The two formed a partnership, making and selling liquor illegally, and eventually quit their jobs.
Another of the mill workers, Byron Bunch, is intrigued and unsettled when Lena Grove suddenly appears at the mill one day. He tells the town’s disgraced former minister, Reverend Gail Hightower, of his efforts to care for the girl. Soon, Lena comes to realize that the man she seeks—her baby’s father, Lucas Burch—is really Joe Brown. Upon Lena’s arrival in town, Brown is being held in the town jail after the murder of a local woman, Joanna Burden, and the burning of her home. Joe Christmas, Miss Burden’s occasional lover, is the chief suspect.
The narrative then shifts to explore several of the characters’ pasts. As a young minister, Gail Hightower secures a church in Jefferson to feed his obsession with his grandfather, a Confederate cavalryman who was killed in the town during the Civil War. Hightower’s young wife is unfaithful and grapples with mental health problems. She eventually dies in a fall from the window of a Memphis hotel room where she is staying with another man. A scandal ensues, and the Jefferson parishioners turn on Hightower, who is forced to step down.
As a child, Joe Christmas is left on the steps of an orphanage. When the facility’s dietician mistakenly believes that Joe has overheard her having sex with a young doctor in her room, she worries she will lose her job. To eliminate this risk, she threatens to expose young Joe’s biracial background and thus have him transferred to an orphanage for black children. She discusses the plan with the orphanage’s janitor, who kidnaps Joe and takes him to Little Rock, where he is found and returned, only to be adopted two weeks later by a sternly religious man, Mr. McEachern, and his wife.
Joe’s new foster father subjects him to regular beatings. As Joe grows and enters puberty, he eventually crosses paths with Bobbie, a prostitute who works as a waitress in the nearby town. When Mr. McEachern catches his son at a dance with Bobbie, a fight erupts, and Joe kills his foster father by smashing a chair over his head. Abandoned by Bobbie and her cohorts, Joe embraces a life on the run and wanders for more than fifteen years, eventually making his way to Jefferson.
In Jefferson, Joe Christmas stays in the cabin on Joanna Burden’s property, and the two quickly become lovers. Their relationship is marked by passion, violence, and long periods in which they ignore each other. Miss Burden wants a child and claims to be pregnant, but Joe is strongly opposed to the idea. After a time, Joe Brown comes to live with Joe Christmas in his cabin. Miss Burden tries to help Joe Christmas financially, but her meddling only provokes his ire. One night, he savagely attacks and kills her with a razor after she tries to fire a pistol at him in an apparent attempt at a murder-suicide.
Miss Burden’s nephew in New Hampshire offers a $1,000 reward for the capture of his aunt’s killer. Search parties with bloodhounds comb the countryside for the fugitive Joe Christmas, who eludes capture for days, running to the point of hunger and exhaustion. Lena, meanwhile, moves into the cabin that the two Joes had shared in order to prepare for the birth of her baby; Byron Bunch stays in a tent nearby.
Joe Christmas is apprehended on the streets of nearby Mottstown. His biological maternal grandfather, Uncle Doc Hines, makes his way through the crowd to curse Joe and call for his death. When the officials from Jefferson arrive to take charge of the prisoner, Mrs. Hines breaks through the crowd as well, hoping to see the face of the grandson who her husband told her died as a child. The Hineses then take the train to Jefferson together.
Byron and the Hineses arrive at Hightower’s house and reveal that Joe Christmas’s father was a circus worker who tried to run off with the Hineses’ daughter before Uncle Doc shot and killed him. Eventually, Uncle Doc placed the baby in the orphanage in Memphis where he worked as a janitor. Byron wants Hightower to lie and claim that Joe Christmas was with him, at his house, on the night of Joanna Burden’s murder. Hightower becomes angry and asks them to leave.
Lena goes into labor, but by the time Byron arrives with the doctor, Hightower has already delivered the baby. Assisting in the delivery is Mrs. Hines, who mistakenly believes that Lena is her long-dead daughter, Milly, and that the newborn is her grandson, Joe Christmas. Byron arranges to have Joe Brown sent to Lena’s cabin; upon arriving, Brown is shocked to see Lena holding his newborn son, slips out a back window, and runs away. Byron sees Brown escape and tries to stop him, but the much larger man beats Byron soundly and escapes on a passing train. Joe Christmas, meanwhile, escapes from his captors as well, while he is being led across the town square. Before long, he is tracked down, shot, killed, and castrated in Hightower’s kitchen by a bounty hunter named Percy Grimm. Afterward, the aging Hightower muses on his past and prepares for his own death.
After a road trip, a local furniture mover near Jefferson recounts to his wife how he gave a ride to a curious couple—a woman with a newborn child accompanied by a man who was not the child’s father. The couple—Lena and Byron—was halfheartedly in search of the baby’s biological father, as the man drove them deeper into Tennessee."
Wander,"Part One of Wonder is told from August “Auggie” Pullman’s point of view. Auggie was born with a genetic syndrome that gives him tiny ears, low eyes, and a misshapen mouth and jaw. By the time he is twelve, he has endured twenty-seven surgeries. Auggie lives in New York City with his parents, his sister, Olivia or “Via,” and his dog, Daisy, and until the novel begins, he has been homeschooled. 
Mom wants Auggie to go to middle school, but Dad feels hesitant, worried the other students will be cruel. Mom takes Auggie to meet Beecher Prep’s principal, Mr. Tushman, who has arranged for three other students—Jack, Charlotte, and Julian—to give Auggie a tour of the school. On the first day of school, Auggie faces a barrage of shocked reactions and surprised looks as people react to his appearance for the first time. Julian teases and provokes Auggie. Mr. Browne, their English teacher, gives his students a precept every month to think and write about. The first precept is about kindness. Auggie becomes good friends with Jack and a girl named Summer who sits with Auggie at lunch of her own volition. However, on Halloween, Auggie overhears Jack telling others that he wishes Auggie would stop following him around. Hurt and rejected, Auggie questions whether he should be in school at all.
Part Two is told from Via’s point of view. Since Auggie’s birth when she was four, she has had to be independent and take a back seat to Auggie’s needs. After Via returns from spending a few weeks with her grandmother, she sees Auggie as others see him for the first time. As Via enters high school, she feels estranged from her former best friends, Ella and Miranda. Miranda has also been a good friend to Auggie and gave him the astronaut helmet that he wore for several years. Auggie confides to Via what he overheard Jack say on Halloween, and they agree school is hard for everyone, but Via encourages Auggie to “suck it up.”
In Part Three, which is told from Summer’s point of view, Summer explains that she chooses to be Auggie’s friend despite criticism from other students. They work on an Egyptian Museum project at her house, where Auggie learns more about Summer’s personal life, including the fact that her father died. Auggie and Summer talk about death and agree that maybe people get to come back with new faces. They talk openly about Auggie’s appearance. When Jack later asks Summer why Auggie is upset with him, she gives him a hint but isn’t explicit.
Part Four is told by Jack. He recalls the day when he gave Auggie the tour of the school but also recalls having seen him outside an ice cream shop before. He is used to Auggie’s face and genuinely likes him as a friend. One day, Jack has an epiphany and finally understands what Summer’s hint meant and why Auggie has been upset with him. Jack feels guilty that he lied to others about his feelings about Auggie. When Julian calls Auggie a “freak,” Jack punches him in the mouth, but he will not tell Mr. Tushman why. Mr. Tushman sends Jack home until after winter break as punishment. Through Facebook messages, Jack apologizes to Auggie, and the boys are friends again. Julian’s mother tells Mr. Tushman that Auggie doesn’t belong at Beecher Prep, but Mr. Tushman disagrees. After the break, Charlotte describes the students who are on Julian’s side, on Auggie’s side, and neutral. Jack goes to Auggie’s house to work on a science fair project. He meets Via and realizes that she knows about what happened on Halloween. Via introduces Auggie and Jack to her boyfriend, Justin.
Part Five is told by Justin. Although he’s unsettled when he meets Auggie, he likes Via and her family very much, especially compared to his parents, who are divorced and rather absent. At school, Justin is cast as the lead in Our Town, and Via has a small part and serves as an understudy for Miranda, who has been cast as Emily, the female lead. When Justin witnesses Julian and others teasing Jack one day, he tells the boys to leave Jack alone. He learns that Miranda and Via were once close friends, and Via confesses that she hasn't told her parents about the play because she doesn’t want them to bring Auggie. She is ashamed that she feels embarrassed by her brother.
In Part Six, Auggie’s point of view returns. He cringes through the science fair because so many people react to seeing him for the first time. Julian puts mean notes in Auggie’s and Jack’s lockers, but Auggie notices that students are accepting him more. When Auggie gets hearing aids, life improves dramatically. However, when he learns that Via doesn’t want him to go to her play, he angrily explodes. Meanwhile, Daisy must be euthanized, which saddens the whole Pullman family, but ultimately draws them closer together and assuages the discord between Auggie and Via. Auggie attends Via’s play with his parents, and they are delighted when they see her playing the lead. Via and Justin get standing ovations.
Part Seven is told by Miranda. In the summer before high school, at camp, she lies and tells people that she has a brother with a deformed face, which increases her popularity. Miranda’s parents are divorced and distant, but she feels safe with Via’s loving family. However, Miranda changes that summer, both in appearance and in attitude. She is cast as the lead in Our Town, but on opening night, when she sees Auggie in the audience and realizes that no one has come to see her, she pretends to be sick so that Via can play the lead. After the play, Miranda sees Auggie backstage, and they hug. The Pullmans invite her to join them for dinner, and she happily accepts.
Part Eight returns to Auggie’s point of view. When his class, minus Julian, goes to the Broarwood Nature Retreat for three days, he feels both excited and afraid. He has a vision of Daisy on his first morning and enjoys nature walks and campfires and horseback riding. On movie night, when Jack has to use the bathroom, Auggie goes with him. In the woods, they meet a group of seventh graders who say awful things to Auggie. A fight breaks out. Jack and several other boys defend and protect Auggie. Auggie gets hurt and loses his hearing aids. 
When Mom picks him up the next day, Auggie says that he had a great time except for the last night. Dad brings home a new puppy. Back at school, Auggie has become a hero along with Jack and the other boys who defended him in the woods. Julian has become irrelevant, and Auggie learns that Julian won’t return to Beecher Prep the following year. When Dad drops Auggie off for his fifth-grade graduation, Dad admits that he is the one who threw away Auggie’s space helmet years ago. Auggie feels angry but forgives him. During the ceremony, Auggie wins the Henry Ward Beecher Award for his strength and kindness and receives a standing ovation. As the Pullmans walk home, Auggie thanks his mother for sending him to school, and his mother thanks him for being such a wonder."
Cemetery,"One night, a man called Jack murders a mother, a father, and a daughter. His final target is a baby boy whose room is at the top of the family home. When he reaches the baby’s crib he finds a stuffed teddy bear in the boy’s place. The boy, having escaped his crib earlier that evening, makes his way up the hill and into the graveyard. He is found by two ghosts, Mr. and Mrs. Owens, who wonder how he ended up there. The boy’s dead mother appears before them and begs them to protect her child. Jack enters the graveyard but is taken away by a shadowy stranger named Silas. That evening, the ghosts deliberate what to do with the child. Eventually, the Lady on the Grey, who shows up for every person’s death, gives her blessing and the child is given the Freedom and the Graveyard. Mr. and Mrs. Owens name him Nobody Owens. 
Later, four-year-old Bod befriends a five-year-old living girl named Scarlett Amber Perkins. They spend time together in the graveyard. One day they visit a mausoleum in the graveyard and encounter an imaginary corpse called the Indigo Man and the slithering creature named the Sleer. The Sleer tells them about the treasures it protects: a brooch, a goblet, and a knife. Outside the tomb, Scarlett’s parents worriedly search for her. The next time Bod sees Scarlett, Scarlett tells him that her family is moving to Scotland. 
When Bod is six years old, he is upset to learn that his guardian Silas will be leaving the graveyard and that he will be taken care of by Miss Lupescu. Miss Lupescu teaches Bod about the different creatures of the world and gives him food he hates. Feeling alone and underappreciated, Bod agrees to go on an adventure with three ghouls who take him through a ghoul-gate. Bod becomes increasingly afraid of the ghouls who suggest that he turn into a ghoul himself. Luckily, Miss Lupescu, in the shape of a menacing dog-like creature, rescues Bod and explains to him that she is a Hound of God. For the rest of the month before Silas’s return, Bod warms up to Miss Lupescu, even feeling sad when she leaves the graveyard. 
When Bod is eight years old, he meets a witch named Liza Hempstock in the unconsecrated portion of the graveyard named Potter’s Field. After hearing that Liza was not buried with a headstone to mark her grave, Bod takes it upon himself to buy her a headstone. He takes the brooch from the Sleer and heads to Abanazer Bolger’s antiques store in town. Transfixed by the brooch and curious to learn more about where Bod attained it, Abanazer locks Bod into a storage room. As Bod thinks about how to escape, Liza appears in the room. Liza, eavesdropping on Abanazer and his acquaintance Tom Hustings, learns that Bod is in danger. Liza casts a spell on Bod helping him Fade, so that when Abanazer and Tom return to the room he is invisible. Still locked inside the room, Bod and Liza hear the men argue about the brooch, until they eventually get into a physical fight and knock each other out. Bod escapes the room, retrieves the brooch, and picks up a black card with the name Jack written on it. 
On his way back to the graveyard, an angry and disappointed Silas intercepts Bod. Back at the graveyard, Bod returns the brooch to the Sleer. Before heading home, Bod, using a paintbrush and a paperweight he took from Abanazer’s store, makes a headstone for Liza.
A ten-year-old Bod witnesses the Danse Macabre, which is a special day in winter when the living and the dead dance with one another. In the book’s interlude, an organization of men from all over the world are eating dessert. One man tells Jack that he must finish the job—killing Bod—that he failed to do years ago. When Bod is eleven years old, Silas tells Bod what he knows about Jack. Bod suggests that it would be a good idea for him to go to school and learn about the world, so he can be prepared to defend himself against Jack. At first, Bod is able to go to school without any issues, but an altercation with two bullies forces Silas to pull him out in order to keep him safe. 
When Bod is fourteen years old, he reunites with Scarlett Amber Perkins after her mother separates from her father and returns to the town. Bod explains to Scarlett about his family’s murder, and to help Bod, Scarlett asks a local historian, Mr. Frost, to help her learn more. Mr. Frost tells Scarlett to bring Bod to his house so that he can reveal what he knows. 
At Mr. Frost’s house, Bod learns that he is, in fact, the man called Jack. Jack’s other associates appear and Bod hides Scarlett in the Indigo Man’s mausoleum. With the help of the ghosts of the graveyard, Bod gets rid of Jack’s associates, who followed him to the cemetery. In the process, Bod learns that they belong to an ancient order called the Jacks of All Trades who, according to a prophecy, must kill Bod in order to save themselves. Jack holds Scarlett hostage in the mausoleum. When Bod arrives, he claims himself the master of the Sleer and the Sleer drags the man named Jack away. A frightened Scarlett calls Bod a monster, then has her memories erased by Silas. When Silas returns to Bod, he takes him out for pizza and reveals that Miss Lupescu died fighting against the Jacks of All Trades in Krakow. 
In the final chapter, fifteen-year-old Bod notices his ability to communicate with the dead is fading. Mr. Owens tells Bod that he was the best son he could’ve hoped for. Liza kisses Bod on his way to visit Silas and says that she will miss him. Bod doesn’t understand why the ghosts are acting this way. Silas explains to Bod that it is time that they must both leave the graveyard. Before Bod leaves, Miss Owens sings him a lullaby from his youth and expresses how proud of Bod she is. Bod knows that he will miss his family in the graveyard, but leaves knowing that it is now time to join the world of the living."
Driving,"In the winter of 1947, the reckless and joyous Dean Moriarty, fresh out of another stint in jail and newly married, comes to New York City and meets Sal Paradise, a young writer with an intellectual group of friends, among them the poet Carlo Marx. Dean fascinates Sal, and their friendship begins three years of restless journeys back and forth across the country. With a combination of bus rides and adventurous hitchhiking escapades, Sal goes to his much-dreamed-of west to join Dean and more friends in Denver, and then continues west by himself, working as a fieldworker in California for awhile, among other things. The next year, Dean comes east to Sal again, foiling Sal's stable life once more, and they drive west together, with more crazy adventures on the way at Bull Lee's in New Orleans, ending in San Francisco this time. The winter after that, Sal goes to Dean, and they blaze across the country together in friendly fashion, and Dean settles in New York for awhile. In the spring, Sal goes to Denver alone, but Dean soon joins him and they go south all the way to Mexico City this time.
Through all of this constant movement, there is an array of colorful characters, shifting landscapes, dramas, and personal development. Dean, a big womanizer, will have three wives and four children in the course of these three years. Perceptive Sal, who at the beginning is weakened and depressed, gains in joy and confidence and finds love at the end. At first Sal is intrigued by Dean because Dean seems to have the active, impulsive passion that Sal lacks, but they turn out to have a lot more in common. The story is in the details."
Bicker,"Buck, a powerful dog, half St. Bernard and half sheepdog, lives on Judge Miller’s estate in California’s Santa Clara Valley. He leads a comfortable life there, but it comes to an end when men discover gold in the Klondike region of Canada and a great demand arises for strong dogs to pull sleds. Buck is kidnapped by a gardener on the Miller estate and sold to dog traders, who teach Buck to obey by beating him with a club and, subsequently, ship him north to the Klondike.
Arriving in the chilly North, Buck is amazed by the cruelty he sees around him. As soon as another dog from his ship, Curly, gets off the boat, a pack of huskies violently attacks and kills her. Watching her death, Buck vows never to let the same fate befall him. Buck becomes the property of Francois and Perrault, two mail carriers working for the Canadian government, and begins to adjust to life as a sled dog. He recovers the instincts of his wild ancestors: he learns to fight, scavenge for food, and sleep beneath the snow on winter nights. At the same time, he develops a fierce rivalry with Spitz, the lead dog in the team. One of their fights is broken up when a pack of wild dogs invades the camp, but Buck begins to undercut Spitz’s authority, and eventually the two dogs become involved in a major fight. Buck kills Spitz and takes his place as the lead dog.
With Buck at the head of the team, Francois and Perrault’s sled makes record time. However, the men soon turn the team over to a mail carrier who forces the dogs to carry much heavier loads. In the midst of a particularly arduous trip, one of the dogs becomes ill, and eventually the driver has to shoot him. At the end of this journey, the dogs are exhausted, and the mail carrier sells them to a group of American gold hunters—Hal, Charles, and Mercedes.
Buck’s new masters are inexperienced and out of place in the wilderness. They overload the sled, beat the dogs, and plan poorly. Halfway through their journey, they begin to run out of food. While the humans bicker, the dogs begin to starve, and the weaker animals soon die. Of an original team of fourteen, only five are still alive when they limp into John Thornton’s camp, still some distance from their destination. Thornton warns them that the ice over which they are traveling is melting and that they may fall through it. Hal dismisses these warnings and tries to get going immediately. The other dogs begin to move, but Buck refuses. When Hal begins to beat him, Thornton intervenes, knocking a knife from Hal’s hand and cutting Buck loose. Hal curses Thornton and starts the sled again, but before they have gone a quarter of a mile, the ice breaks open, swallowing both the humans and the dogs.
Thornton becomes Buck’s master, and Buck’s devotion to him is total. He saves Thornton from drowning in a river, attacks a man who tries to start a fight with Thornton in a bar, and, most remarkably, wins a $1,600 wager for his new master by pulling a sled carrying a thousand-pound load. But Buck’s love for Thornton is mixed with a growing attraction to the wild, and he feels as if he is being called away from civilization and into the wilderness. This feeling grows stronger when he accompanies Thornton and his friends in search of a lost mine hidden deep in the Canadian forest.
While the men search for gold, Buck ranges far afield, befriending wolves and hunting bears and moose. He always returns to Thornton in the end, until, one day, he comes back to camp to find that Yeehat Indians have attacked and killed his master. Buck attacks the Indians, killing several and scattering the rest, and then heads off into the wild, where he becomes the leader of a pack of wolves. He becomes a legendary figure, a Ghost Dog, fathering countless cubs and inspiring fear in the Yeehats—but every year he returns to the place where Thornton died, to mourn his master before returning to his life in the wild."
Wrote,"Anne’s diary begins on her thirteenth birthday, June 12, 1942, and ends shortly after her fifteenth. At the start of her diary, Anne describes fairly typical girlhood experiences, writing about her friendships with other girls, her crushes on boys, and her academic performance at school. Because anti-Semitic laws forced Jews into separate schools, Anne and her older sister, Margot, attended the Jewish Lyceum in Amsterdam.
	The Franks had moved to the Netherlands in the years leading up to World War II to escape persecution in Germany. After the Germans invaded the Netherlands in 1940, the Franks were forced into hiding. With another family, the van Daans, and an acquaintance, Mr. Dussel, they moved into a small secret annex above Otto Frank’s office where they had stockpiled food and supplies. The employees from Otto’s firm helped hide the Franks and kept them supplied with food, medicine, and information about the outside world.
	The residents of the annex pay close attention to every development of the war by listening to the radio. Some bits of news catch Anne’s attention and make their way into her diary, providing a vivid historical context for her personal thoughts. The adults make optimistic bets about when the war will end, and their mood is severely affected by Allied setbacks or German advances. Amsterdam is devastated by the war during the two years the Franks are in hiding. All of the city’s residents suffer, since food becomes scarce and robberies more frequent.
	Anne often writes about her feelings of isolation and loneliness. She has a tumultuous relationship with the adults in the annex, particularly her mother, whom she considers lacking in love and affection. She adores her father, but she is frequently scolded and criticized by Mr. and Mrs. van Daan and Mr. Dussel. Anne thinks that her sister, Margot, is smart, pretty, and agreeable, but she does not feel close to her and does not write much about her. Anne eventually develops a close friendship with Peter van Daan, the teenage boy in the annex. Mr. Frank does not approve, however, and the intensity of Anne’s infatuation begins to lessen.
	Anne matures considerably throughout the course of her diary entries, moving from detailed accounts of basic activities to deeper, more profound thoughts about humanity and her own personal nature. She finds it difficult to understand why the Jews are being singled out and persecuted. Anne also confronts her own identity. Though she considers herself to be German, her German citizenship has been revoked, and though she calls Holland her home, many of the Dutch have turned against the Jews. Anne feels a tremendous solidarity with her aggrieved people, and yet at the same time she wants to be seen as an individual rather than a member of a persecuted group.
During the two years recorded in her diary, Anne deals with confinement and deprivation, as well as the complicated and difficult issues of growing up in the brutal circumstances of the Holocaust. Her diary describes a struggle to define herself within this climate of oppression. Anne’s diary ends without comment on August 1, 1944, the end of a seemingly normal day that leaves us with the expectation of seeing another entry on the next page. However, the Frank family is betrayed to the Nazis and arrested on August 4, 1944. Anne’s diary, the observations of an imaginative, friendly, sometimes petty, and rather normal teenage girl, comes to an abrupt and silent end. 
Otto Frank is the family’s sole survivor, and he recovers Anne’s diary from Miep. He decides to fulfill Anne’s wishes by publishing the diary. Anne’s diary becomes a condemnation of the unimaginable horror of the Holocaust, and one of the few accounts that describe it from a young person’s perspective.
	Since Anne’s diary is a true personal account of a life in hiding, it is inappropriate to analyze it as a novel or other work of fiction. Parts of the diary were intended for public view, but others clearly were not. To appreciate and interpret the diary, it is necessary to consider its horrible context, World War II and the Holocaust, before any discussion of plot development or thematic content."
Tombstones,"In the late winter months of 1801, a man named Lockwood rents a manor house called Thrushcross Grange in the isolated moor country of England. Here, he meets his dour landlord, Heathcliff, a wealthy man who lives in the ancient manor of Wuthering Heights, four miles away from the Grange. In this wild, stormy countryside, Lockwood asks his housekeeper, Nelly Dean, to tell him the story of Heathcliff and the strange denizens of Wuthering Heights. Nelly consents, and Lockwood writes down his recollections of her tale in his diary; these written recollections form the main part of Wuthering Heights.
Nelly remembers her childhood. As a young girl, she works as a servant at Wuthering Heights for the owner of the manor, Mr. Earnshaw, and his family. One day, Mr. Earnshaw goes to Liverpool and returns home with an orphan boy whom he will raise with his own children. At first, the Earnshaw children—a boy named Hindley and his younger sister Catherine—detest the dark-skinned Heathcliff. But Catherine quickly comes to love him, and the two soon grow inseparable, spending their days playing on the moors. After his wife’s death, Mr. Earnshaw grows to prefer Heathcliff to his own son, and when Hindley continues his cruelty to Heathcliff, Mr. Earnshaw sends Hindley away to college, keeping Heathcliff nearby.
Three years later, Mr. Earnshaw dies, and Hindley inherits Wuthering Heights. He returns with a wife, Frances, and immediately seeks revenge on Heathcliff. Once an orphan, later a pampered and favored son, Heathcliff now finds himself treated as a common laborer, forced to work in the fields. Heathcliff continues his close relationship with Catherine, however. One night they wander to Thrushcross Grange, hoping to tease Edgar and Isabella Linton, the cowardly, snobbish children who live there. Catherine is bitten by a dog and is forced to stay at the Grange to recuperate for five weeks, during which time Mrs. Linton works to make her a proper young lady. By the time Catherine returns, she has become infatuated with Edgar, and her relationship with Heathcliff grows more complicated.
When Frances dies after giving birth to a baby boy named Hareton, Hindley descends into the depths of alcoholism, and behaves even more cruelly and abusively toward Heathcliff. Eventually, Catherine’s desire for social advancement prompts her to become engaged to Edgar Linton, despite her overpowering love for Heathcliff. Heathcliff runs away from Wuthering Heights, staying away for three years, and returning shortly after Catherine and Edgar’s marriage.
When Heathcliff returns, he immediately sets about seeking revenge on all who have wronged him. Having come into a vast and mysterious wealth, he deviously lends money to the drunken Hindley, knowing that Hindley will increase his debts and fall into deeper despondency. When Hindley dies, Heathcliff inherits the manor. He also places himself in line to inherit Thrushcross Grange by marrying Isabella Linton, whom he treats very cruelly. Catherine becomes ill, gives birth to a daughter, and dies. Heathcliff begs her spirit to remain on Earth—she may take whatever form she will, she may haunt him, drive him mad—just as long as she does not leave him alone. Shortly thereafter, Isabella flees to London and gives birth to Heathcliff’s son, named Linton after her family. She keeps the boy with her there.
Thirteen years pass, during which Nelly Dean serves as Catherine’s daughter’s nursemaid at Thrushcross Grange. Young Cathy is beautiful and headstrong like her mother, but her temperament is modified by her father’s gentler influence. Cathy grows up at the Grange with no knowledge of Wuthering Heights; one day, however, wandering through the moors, she discovers the manor, meets Hareton, and plays together with him. Soon afterwards, Isabella dies, and Linton comes to live with Heathcliff. Heathcliff treats his sickly, whining son even more cruelly than he treated the boy’s mother.
Three years later, Cathy meets Heathcliff on the moors, and makes a visit to Wuthering Heights to meet Linton. She and Linton begin a secret romance conducted entirely through letters. When Nelly destroys Cathy's collection of letters, the girl begins sneaking out at night to spend time with her frail young lover, who asks her to come back and nurse him back to health. However, it quickly becomes apparent that Linton is pursuing Cathy only because Heathcliff is forcing him to; Heathcliff hopes that if Cathy marries Linton, his legal claim upon Thrushcross Grange—and his revenge upon Edgar Linton—will be complete.
One day, as Edgar Linton grows ill and nears death, Heathcliff lures Nelly and Cathy back to Wuthering Heights, and holds them prisoner until Cathy marries Linton. Soon after the marriage, Edgar dies, and his death is quickly followed by the death of the sickly Linton. Heathcliff now controls both Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange. He forces Cathy to live at Wuthering Heights and act as a common servant, while he rents Thrushcross Grange to Lockwood.
Nelly’s story ends as she reaches the present. Lockwood, appalled, ends his tenancy at Thrushcross Grange and returns to London. However, six months later, he pays a visit to Nelly, and learns of further developments in the story. Although Cathy originally mocked Hareton’s ignorance and illiteracy (in an act of retribution, Heathcliff ended Hareton’s education after Hindley died), Cathy grows to love Hareton as they live together at Wuthering Heights. Heathcliff becomes more and more obsessed with the memory of the elder Catherine, to the extent that he begins speaking to her ghost. Everything he sees reminds him of her. Shortly after a night spent walking on the moors, Heathcliff dies. Hareton and Cathy inherit Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange, and they plan to be married on the next New Year’s Day. After hearing the end of the story, Lockwood goes to visit the graves of Catherine and Heathcliff.
Chronology
The story of Wuthering Heights is told through flashbacks recorded in diary entries, and events are often presented out of chronological order—Lockwood’s narrative takes place after Nelly’s narrative, for instance, but is interspersed with Nelly’s story in his journal. Nevertheless, the novel contains enough clues to enable an approximate reconstruction of its chronology, which was elaborately designed by Emily Brontë. For instance, Lockwood’s diary entries are recorded in the late months of 1801 and in September 1802; in 1801, Nelly tells Lockwood that she has lived at Thrushcross Grange for eighteen years, since Catherine’s marriage to Edgar, which must then have occurred in 1783.
We know that Catherine was engaged to Edgar for three years, and that Nelly was twenty-two when they were engaged, so the engagement must have taken place in 1780, and Nelly must have been born in 1758. Since Nelly is a few years older than Catherine, and since Lockwood comments that Heathcliff is about forty years old in 1801, it stands to reason that Heathcliff and Catherine were born around 1761, three years after Nelly. There are several other clues like this in the novel (such as Hareton’s birth, which occurs in June, 1778). The following chronology is based on those clues, and should closely approximate the timing of the novel’s important events. A “~” before a date indicates that it cannot be precisely determined from the evidence in the novel, but only closely estimated.
1500: The stone above the front door of Wuthering Heights, bearing the name of Hareton Earnshaw, is inscribed, possibly to mark the completion of the house.
1758: Nelly is born.
~1761: Heathcliff and Catherine are born.
~1767: Mr. Earnshaw brings Heathcliff to live at Wuthering Heights. 
1774: Mr. Earnshaw sends Hindley away to college.
1777: Mr. Earnshaw dies; Hindley and Frances take possession of Wuthering Heights; Catherine first visits Thrushcross Grange around Christmastime.
1778: Hareton is born in June; Frances dies; Hindley begins his slide into alcoholism.
1780: Catherine becomes engaged to Edgar Linton; Heathcliff leaves Wuthering Heights.
1783: Catherine and Edgar are married; Heathcliff arrives at Thrushcross Grange in September.
1784: Heathcliff and Isabella elope in the early part of the year; Catherine becomes ill with brain fever; her daughter Cathy is born late in the year; Catherine dies.
1785: Early in the year, Isabella flees Wuthering Heights and settles in London; Linton is born.
~1785: Hindley dies; Heathcliff inherits Wuthering Heights.
~1797: Young Cathy meets Hareton and visits Wuthering Heights for the first time; Linton comes from London after Isabella dies (in late 1797 or early 1798).
1800: Cathy stages her romance with Linton in the winter.
1801: Early in the year, Cathy is imprisoned by Heathcliff and forced to marry Linton; Edgar Linton dies; Linton dies; Heathcliff assumes control of Thrushcross Grange. Late in the year, Lockwood rents the Grange from Heathcliff and begins his tenancy. In a winter storm, Lockwood takes ill and begins conversing with Nelly Dean.
1801-1802: During the winter, Nelly narrates her story for Lockwood.
1802: In spring, Lockwood returns to London; Cathy and Hareton fall in love; Heathcliff dies; Lockwood returns in September and hears the end of the story from Nelly.
1803: On New Year’s Day, Cathy and Hareton plan to be married."
Title,"Okonkwo is a wealthy and respected warrior of the Umuofia clan, a lower Nigerian tribe that is part of a consortium of nine connected villages. He is haunted by the actions of Unoka, his cowardly and spendthrift father, who died in disrepute, leaving many village debts unsettled. In response, Okonkwo became a clansman, warrior, farmer, and family provider extraordinaire. He has a twelve-year-old son named Nwoye whom he finds lazy; Okonkwo worries that Nwoye will end up a failure like Unoka.
In a settlement with a neighboring tribe, Umuofia wins a virgin and a fifteen-year-old boy. Okonkwo takes charge of the boy, Ikemefuna, and finds an ideal son in him. Nwoye likewise forms a strong attachment to the newcomer. Despite his fondness for Ikemefuna and despite the fact that the boy begins to call him “father,” Okonkwo does not let himself show any affection for him.
During the Week of Peace, Okonkwo accuses his youngest wife, Ojiugo, of negligence. He severely beats her, breaking the peace of the sacred week. He makes some sacrifices to show his repentance, but he has shocked his community irreparably.
Ikemefuna stays with Okonkwo’s family for three years. Nwoye looks up to him as an older brother and, much to Okonkwo’s pleasure, develops a more masculine attitude. One day, the locusts come to Umuofia—they will come every year for seven years before disappearing for another generation. The village excitedly collects them because they are good to eat when cooked.
Ogbuefi Ezeudu, a respected village elder, informs Okonkwo in private that the Oracle has said that Ikemefuna must be killed. He tells Okonkwo that because Ikemefuna calls him “father,” Okonkwo should not take part in the boy’s death. Okonkwo lies to Ikemefuna, telling him that they must return him to his home village. Nwoye bursts into tears.
As he walks with the men of Umuofia, Ikemefuna thinks about seeing his mother. After several hours of walking, some of Okonkwo’s clansmen attack the boy with machetes. Ikemefuna runs to Okonkwo for help. But Okonkwo, who doesn’t wish to look weak in front of his fellow tribesmen, cuts the boy down despite the Oracle’s admonishment. When Okonkwo returns home, Nwoye deduces that his friend is dead.
Okonkwo sinks into a depression, neither able to sleep nor eat. He visits his friend Obierika and begins to feel revived a bit. Okonkwo’s daughter Ezinma falls ill, but she recovers after Okonkwo gathers leaves for her medicine.
The death of Ogbuefi Ezeudu is announced to the surrounding villages by means of the ekwe, a musical instrument. Okonkwo feels guilty because the last time Ezeudu visited him was to warn him against taking part in Ikemefuna’s death. At Ogbuefi Ezeudu’s large and elaborate funeral, the men beat drums and fire their guns. Tragedy compounds upon itself when Okonkwo’s gun explodes and kills Ogbuefi Ezeudu’s sixteen-year-old son.
Because killing a clansman is a crime against the earth goddess, Okonkwo must take his family into exile for seven years in order to atone. He gathers his most valuable belongings and takes his family to his mother’s natal village, Mbanta. The men from Ogbuefi Ezeudu’s quarter burn Okonkwo’s buildings and kill his animals to cleanse the village of his sin.
Okonkwo’s kinsmen, especially his uncle, Uchendu, receive him warmly. They help him build a new compound of huts and lend him yam seeds to start a farm. Although he is bitterly disappointed at his misfortune, Okonkwo reconciles himself to life in his motherland.
During the second year of Okonkwo’s exile, Obierika brings several bags of cowries (shells used as currency) that he has made by selling Okonkwo’s yams. Obierika plans to continue to do so until Okonkwo returns to the village. Obierika also brings the bad news that Abame, another village, has been destroyed by the white man.
Soon afterward, six missionaries travel to Mbanta. Through an interpreter named Mr. Kiaga, the missionaries’ leader, Mr. Brown, speaks to the villagers. He tells them that their gods are false and that worshipping more than one God is idolatrous. But the villagers do not understand how the Holy Trinity can be accepted as one God. Although his aim is to convert the residents of Umuofia to Christianity, Mr. Brown does not allow his followers to antagonize the clan.
Mr. Brown grows ill and is soon replaced by Reverend James Smith, an intolerant and strict man. The more zealous converts are relieved to be free of Mr. Brown’s policy of restraint. One such convert, Enoch, dares to unmask an egwugwu during the annual ceremony to honor the earth deity, an act equivalent to killing an ancestral spirit. The next day, the egwugwu burn Enoch’s compound and Reverend Smith’s church to the ground.
The District Commissioner is upset by the burning of the church and requests that the leaders of Umuofia meet with him. Once they are gathered, however, the leaders are handcuffed and thrown in jail, where they suffer insults and physical abuse.
After the prisoners are released, the clansmen hold a meeting, during which five court messengers approach and order the clansmen to desist. Expecting his fellow clan members to join him in uprising, Okonkwo kills their leader with his machete. When the crowd allows the other messengers to escape, Okonkwo realizes that his clan is not willing to go to war.
When the District Commissioner arrives at Okonkwo’s compound, he finds that Okonkwo has hanged himself. Obierika and his friends lead the commissioner to the body. Obierika explains that suicide is a grave sin; thus, according to custom, none of Okonkwo’s clansmen may touch his body. The commissioner, who is writing a book about Africa, believes that the story of Okonkwo’s rebellion and death will make for an interesting paragraph or two. He has already chosen the book’s title: The Pacification of the Primitive Tribes of the Lower Niger."
Descends,"On the Mediterranean Sea, Aeneas and his fellow Trojans flee from their home city of Troy, which has been destroyed by the Greeks. They sail for Italy, where Aeneas is destined to found Rome. As they near their destination, a fierce storm throws them off course and lands them in Carthage. Dido, Carthage’s founder and queen, welcomes them. Aeneas relates to Dido the long and painful story of his group’s travels thus far.
Aeneas tells of the sack of Troy that ended the Trojan War after ten years of Greek siege. In the final campaign, the Trojans were tricked when they accepted into their city walls a wooden horse that, unbeknownst to them, harbored several Greek soldiers in its hollow belly. He tells how he escaped the burning city with his father, Anchises; his son, Ascanius; and the hearth gods that represent their fallen city. Assured by the gods that a glorious future awaited him in Italy, he set sail with a fleet containing the surviving citizens of Troy. Aeneas relates the ordeals they faced on their journey. Twice they attempted to build a new city, only to be driven away by bad omens and plagues. Harpies, creatures that are part woman and part bird, cursed them, but they also encountered friendly countrymen unexpectedly. Finally, after the loss of Anchises and a bout of terrible weather, they made their way to Carthage.
Impressed by Aeneas’s exploits and sympathetic to his suffering, Dido, a Phoenician princess who fled her home and founded Carthage after her brother murdered her husband, falls in love with Aeneas. They live together as lovers for a period, until the gods remind Aeneas of his duty to found a new city. He determines to set sail once again. Dido is devastated by his departure, and kills herself by ordering a huge pyre to be built with Aeneas’s castaway possessions, climbing upon it, and stabbing herself with the sword Aeneas leaves behind.
As the Trojans make for Italy, bad weather blows them to Sicily, where they hold funeral games for the dead Anchises. The women, tired of the voyage, begin to burn the ships, but a downpour puts the fires out. Some of the travel-weary stay behind, while Aeneas, reinvigorated after his father visits him in a dream, takes the rest on toward Italy. Once there, Aeneas descends into the underworld, guided by the Sibyl of Cumae, to visit his father. He is shown a pageant of the future history and heroes of Rome, which helps him to understand the importance of his mission. Aeneas returns from the underworld, and the Trojans continue up the coast to the region of Latium.
The arrival of the Trojans in Italy begins peacefully. King Latinus, the Italian ruler, extends his hospitality, hoping that Aeneas will prove to be the foreigner whom, according to a prophecy, his daughter Lavinia is supposed to marry. But Latinus’s wife, Amata, has other ideas. She means for Lavinia to marry Turnus, a local suitor. Amata and Turnus cultivate enmity toward the newly arrived Trojans. Meanwhile, Ascanius hunts a stag that was a pet of the local herdsmen. A fight breaks out, and several people are killed. Turnus, riding this current of anger, begins a war.
Aeneas, at the suggestion of the river god Tiberinus, sails north up the Tiber to seek military support among the neighboring tribes. During this voyage, his mother, Venus, descends to give him a new set of weapons, wrought by Vulcan. While the Trojan leader is away, Turnus attacks. Aeneas returns to find his countrymen embroiled in battle. Pallas, the son of Aeneas’s new ally Evander, is killed by Turnus. Aeneas flies into a violent fury, and many more are slain by the day’s end.
The two sides agree to a truce so that they can bury the dead, and the Latin leaders discuss whether to continue the battle. They decide to spare any further unnecessary carnage by proposing a hand-to-hand duel between Aeneas and Turnus. When the two leaders face off, however, the other men begin to quarrel, and full-scale battle resumes. Aeneas is wounded in the thigh, but eventually the Trojans threaten the enemy city. Turnus rushes out to meet Aeneas, who wounds Turnus badly. Aeneas nearly spares Turnus but, remembering the slain Pallas, slays him instead."
Pride,"The news that a wealthy young gentleman named Charles Bingley has rented the manor of Netherfield Park causes a great stir in the nearby village of Longbourn, especially in the Bennet household. The Bennets have five unmarried daughters—from oldest to youngest, Jane, Elizabeth, Mary, Kitty, and Lydia—and Mrs. Bennet is desperate to see them all married. After Mr. Bennet pays a social visit to Mr. Bingley, the Bennets attend a ball at which Mr. Bingley is present. He is taken with Jane and spends much of the evening dancing with her. His close friend, Mr. Darcy, is less pleased with the evening and haughtily refuses to dance with Elizabeth, which makes everyone view him as arrogant and obnoxious.
At social functions over subsequent weeks, however, Mr. Darcy finds himself increasingly attracted to Elizabeth’s charm and intelligence. Jane’s friendship with Mr. Bingley also continues to burgeon, and Jane pays a visit to the Bingley mansion. On her journey to the house she is caught in a downpour and catches ill, forcing her to stay at Netherfield for several days. In order to tend to Jane, Elizabeth hikes through muddy fields and arrives with a spattered dress, much to the disdain of the snobbish Miss Bingley, Charles Bingley’s sister. Miss Bingley’s spite only increases when she notices that Darcy, whom she is pursuing, pays quite a bit of attention to Elizabeth.
When Elizabeth and Jane return home, they find Mr. Collins visiting their household. Mr. Collins is a young clergyman who stands to inherit Mr. Bennet’s property, which has been “entailed,” meaning that it can only be passed down to male heirs. Mr. Collins is a pompous fool, though he is quite enthralled by the Bennet girls. Shortly after his arrival, he makes a proposal of marriage to Elizabeth. She turns him down, wounding his pride. Meanwhile, the Bennet girls have become friendly with militia officers stationed in a nearby town. Among them is Wickham, a handsome young soldier who is friendly toward Elizabeth and tells her how Darcy cruelly cheated him out of an inheritance.
At the beginning of winter, the Bingleys and Darcy leave Netherfield and return to London, much to Jane’s dismay. A further shock arrives with the news that Mr. Collins has become engaged to Charlotte Lucas, Elizabeth’s best friend and the poor daughter of a local knight. Charlotte explains to Elizabeth that she is getting older and needs the match for financial reasons. Charlotte and Mr. Collins get married and Elizabeth promises to visit them at their new home. As winter progresses, Jane visits the city to see friends (hoping also that she might see Mr. Bingley). However, Miss Bingley visits her and behaves rudely, while Mr. Bingley fails to visit her at all. The marriage prospects for the Bennet girls appear bleak.
That spring, Elizabeth visits Charlotte, who now lives near the home of Mr. Collins’s patron, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, who is also Darcy’s aunt. Darcy calls on Lady Catherine and encounters Elizabeth, whose presence leads him to make a number of visits to the Collins’s home, where she is staying. One day, he makes a shocking proposal of marriage, which Elizabeth quickly refuses. She tells Darcy that she considers him arrogant and unpleasant, then scolds him for steering Bingley away from Jane and disinheriting Wickham. Darcy leaves her but shortly thereafter delivers a letter to her. In this letter, he admits that he urged Bingley to distance himself from Jane, but claims he did so only because he thought their romance was not serious. As for Wickham, he informs Elizabeth that the young officer is a liar and that the real cause of their disagreement was Wickham’s attempt to elope with his young sister, Georgiana Darcy.
This letter causes Elizabeth to reevaluate her feelings about Darcy. She returns home and acts coldly toward Wickham. The militia is leaving town, which makes the younger, rather man-crazy Bennet girls distraught. Lydia manages to obtain permission from her father to spend the summer with an old colonel in Brighton, where Wickham’s regiment will be stationed. With the arrival of June, Elizabeth goes on another journey, this time with the Gardiners, who are relatives of the Bennets. The trip takes her to the North and eventually to the neighborhood of Pemberley, Darcy’s estate. She visits Pemberley, after making sure that Darcy is away, and delights in the building and grounds, while hearing from Darcy’s servants that he is a wonderful, generous master. Suddenly, Darcy arrives and behaves cordially toward her. Making no mention of his proposal, he entertains the Gardiners and invites Elizabeth to meet his sister.
Shortly thereafter, however, a letter arrives from home, telling Elizabeth that Lydia has eloped with Wickham and that the couple is nowhere to be found, which suggests that they may be living together out of wedlock. Fearful of the disgrace such a situation would bring on her entire family, Elizabeth hastens home. Mr. Gardiner and Mr. Bennet go off to search for Lydia, but Mr. Bennet eventually returns home empty-handed. Just when all hope seems lost, a letter comes from Mr. Gardiner saying that the couple has been found and that Wickham has agreed to marry Lydia in exchange for an annual income. The Bennets are convinced that Mr. Gardiner has paid off Wickham, but Elizabeth learns that the source of the money, and of her family’s salvation, was none other than Darcy.
Now married, Wickham and Lydia return to Longbourn briefly, where Mr. Bennet treats them coldly. They then depart for Wickham’s new assignment in the North of England. Shortly thereafter, Bingley returns to Netherfield and resumes his courtship of Jane. Darcy goes to stay with him and pays visits to the Bennets but makes no mention of his desire to marry Elizabeth. Bingley, on the other hand, presses his suit and proposes to Jane, to the delight of everyone but Bingley’s haughty sister. While the family celebrates, Lady Catherine de Bourgh pays a visit to Longbourn. She corners Elizabeth and says that she has heard that Darcy, her nephew, is planning to marry her. Since she considers a Bennet an unsuitable match for a Darcy, Lady Catherine demands that Elizabeth promise to refuse him. Elizabeth spiritedly refuses, saying she is not engaged to Darcy, but she will not promise anything against her own happiness. A little later, Elizabeth and Darcy go out walking together and he tells her that his feelings have not altered since the spring. She tenderly accepts his proposal, and both Jane and Elizabeth are married."
Founded,"Educated is primarily retrospective, consisting of Tara Westover's memories about her past. She tells the story of the events of her life from a vantage point in her late twenties, occasionally interjecting to comment on the process of trying to arrive at an accurate version of the past. Tara was born the youngest of seven children to parents whom she refers to as Faye and Gene (pseudonyms). The Westover family lived on a farm in rural Idaho, where Gene made a living salvaging scrap metal while Faye worked as an unlicensed midwife and herbal healer. Gene suffered from paranoid fears about interference from the federal government, and as a result he refused to allow his children to attend school, receive birth certificates, or receive medical attention. Gene was also a devout Mormon who believed in radical self-sufficiency and an impending Day of Judgement.
		
Shifts in the Westover family dynamic began to emerge when Tara was about nine. Her mother's work as a midwife increased her sense of independence, but after sustaining a serious and untreated brain injury in a car accident, Faye began to lose confidence in her skills, and focused instead on using herbal remedies and a form of intuitive healing. Around this time, Tyler (the third son) announced that he was going to attend college, which estranged him from his family. Tyler's absence forced Tara to become more involved in helping her father with his scrapping work, which left her constantly exposed to the possibility of dangerous injury. It also made her more curious about possibly pursuing an education herself. When Tara was ten, she told her disapproving father that she wanted to begin going to school, but nothing came of the idea.
As Tara grew into her teens, she acquired more independence from her family due to taking on various jobs and pursuing singing and musical theatre in the local community. However, her life was dominated by the strict rules and religious doctrine her father imposed, and Tara often worried about becoming sinful. When Tara was thirteen, her older brother Shawn moved back home. At first Shawn and Tara were close and spent a lot of time together. When Tara was about fifteen, however, Shawn began to be physically abusive toward her. His behavior only got worse after Shawn experienced a head injury. Tyler eventually realized that Shawn was hurting Tara, and he urged Tara to seriously consider applying to college and getting away from the family. Although she was uncertain at first, Tara began to study and was eventually accepted at Brigham Young University, having passed herself off as homeschooled.
In January 2004, when Tara was seventeen years old, she moved to Utah to begin her college education. She found the adjustment very difficult at first, but eventually began to excel in her studies. Tara's finances were precarious, and she had to hold multiple jobs and maintain very high grades to retain her scholarship. Her emerging independence also caused a threatening dynamic between her, Gene, and Shawn. Whenever Tara returned to Buck's Peak, her father manipulated her into working for him, while Shawn continued to physically and emotionally abuse her. Tara eventually confided to a bishop about her life, and he helped her to secure funding to finance her education. Tara's studies, and the people she met, also gradually opened her eyes to different realities and force her to realize how damaging and isolating her childhood has been. Tara eventually changed her major to studying history, and is encouraged to apply for a study abroad program at Cambridge University in England.
Tara's experience at Cambridge broadened her horizons even further, and she was encouraged to consider graduate studies. Tara still felt isolated from her peers, and ashamed of her origins. She hid most of her past even from her friends and the men she occasionally dated. She was eventually awarded a prestigious Cambridge Gates Fellowship and moved to England to pursue a Master's degree. She remained in close contact with her family and returned to Idaho regularly to visit, but her relationship with them deteriorated. Shawn was growing increasingly erratic and violent, and Tara feared for the safety of his wife and young child. By chance, she revealed to her sister Audrey that Shawn had been abusive with her, and Audrey later confided that Shawn abused her as well. Audrey blamed herself for not protecting her younger sister, and suggested that she and Tara confront their parents and Shawn about what happened to them.
By then Tara had built a happy life for herself in England, and was working on a PhD in history at Cambridge. However, the attempt to speak the truth quickly became a source of conflict in the family. Tara became more and more ostracized within her family, eventually culminating in Shawn learning that she had been telling their parents about the abuse she suffered. Realizing her family would never trust her claims, Tara became estranged from most of them, with the exception of Tyler.  The estrangement from her family prompted grief and depression for Tara, but she was finally able to heal, and successfully completed her PhD. By the end of her memoir, Tara has accepted that she may never have a relationship with her family again, but she takes pride in the independence she has established, and the life she has built for herself."
Enlarged,"Shirin and her family are American Muslims. Her parents come from Iran, but she and her brother Navid were both born in the United States. Her parents move the family often in an ongoing effort to live in bigger homes in better neighborhoods to improve their opportunities for the future. As the story opens, Shirin and Navid are starting at a new high school for the third time in two years. Shirin is sixteen and a sophomore, while Navid, who is very protective of his sister, is a senior. A Very Wide Expanse of Sea tells Shirin’s story during that sophomore year.
A year has passed since 9/11, and because Shirin always wears a hijab, she is harassed and teased by other students. Once, just after the terrorist attacks, several boys attacked Shirin and choked her with her scarf. Because of the racism and prejudice Shirin has experienced throughout her life, she has developed a thick skin. At school, she talks to no one, looks at no one, and does her best to stay under the radar. She has a quick temper, however, and automatically assumes that anyone looking at her or talking to her has malicious or racist intent. Navid, who is far more outgoing than Shirin, starts a breakdancing team with his friends Jacobi, Carlos, and Bijan. He then invites Shirin to join them, which she does. They get a teacher to sponsor the activity, which means they get a room to practice in after school.
Shirin meets a boy named Ocean when they are partnered in biology class to dissect a cat. Because they still have to write a report, she gives him her phone number, and their friendship begins even if it gets off to a rocky start. As they get to know each other, Ocean expresses interest in Shirin’s family and her culture, and they begin texting and talking on the phone. Ocean and Shirin are also both in a class called Global Perspectives, which is taught by Mr. Jordan. When Mr. Jordan uses Shirin to illustrate a point about prejudice, Shirin gets upset and leaves class. Concerned, Ocean follows her, and the two sit at an IHOP and talk, feeling a mutual attraction. 
At lunch one day, Shirin meets a boy named Yusef, another Muslim, who is a senior. At practice, Jacobi tells Shirin that her constant anger is not healthy, which makes her question her defensiveness. Shirin attempts to drop Mr. Jordan’s class, but then he apologizes to her and asks her to return to class, which she does. Ocean tries to get to know her more, and one day they collide in the hallway and accidentally embrace. The physical contact exhilarates them both, and they soon admit their strong feelings for each other. Shirin believes that their relationship will not be good for either of them because of their fellow students’ bigotry. She tries to avoid Ocean, but she finds that she cannot. One day, they kiss in Ocean’s car during lunch, and other students see them. Word spreads quickly that they are a couple.
Shirin discovers that Ocean is a junior and a star basketball player on whom the school and varsity team depend to win championships. She realizes she had no idea what a big deal he was. Ocean confides in Shirin, telling her he doesn’t like playing basketball but doesn’t want to let down his mother, Coach Hart, the team, or the school. Ocean tells Shirin about his parents’ divorce and his mother’s inheritance. Ramadan arrives, and Shirin’s family begins their fasting, which Shirin likes but Navid hates. Shirin invites Ocean to attend a breakdancing event with her one Saturday night, and Navid gives them one hour alone afterward. During their time alone, Ocean takes Shirin to the park where he learned to play basketball. When Shirin expresses her concern for his unhappiness, Ocean feels moved by her compassion for him.
Ocean attends Thanksgiving dinner at Shirin’s house and falls in love with her family and the food. In her room, they kiss again, until Navid cuts their time alone short when he knocks on the door. Later, on the phone, Ocean admits that he is falling in love. As he and Shirin are both tired of hiding their relationship, Shirin agrees to let Ocean drive her to school. In the parking lot, someone calls her “Aladdin,” and someone else throws a cinnamon roll at her, which gets frosting all over her face and scarf. When she goes to the bathroom to wash up, a girl snaps a photo of her without her hijab on and posts it online for the entire school to see. 
Later, Navid and the other breakdancers attack the person who threw the roll. Someone posts a letter accusing Ocean of being a terrorist sympathizer because Shirin is his girlfriend. Coach Hart tells Ocean to stay away from Shirin, but Ocean refuses. Coach Hart then screams at Shirin for ruining Ocean’s life and jeopardizing his scholarship. Even Ocean’s mother, Linda, approaches Shirin and tries to talk her into breaking up with Ocean. Linda admits that she has spent Ocean’s college money, so he needs a basketball scholarship to continue his education. Ocean begs Shirin not to break up with him, but she wants to protect him, so she begins avoiding him completely. Ocean is heartbroken. After he sees her with Yusef, who has joined their breakdancing team, Ocean is suspended for fighting.
After Navid’s breakdancing team wins the school talent show, students begin to change their attitudes toward Shirin, and their hypocrisy angers her. One day, Ocean approaches her locker, and they share how much they miss each other. When Shirin returns to her locker after breakdancing practice, she realizes she never locked it. While nothing has been stolen, she notes that her journal has been moved from the bottom to the top, and she suspects Ocean read it. She feels upset by this idea but also grateful that he might now know her deep, true feelings for him. After Ocean gets suspended again—this time for breaking Coach Hart’s nose, he appears at Shirin’s house one morning, and they skip school together. 
Back at Ocean’s house, Ocean apologizes for reading Shirin’s journal, and they kiss again. When they embrace, Shirin notes that it feels like they have been drowning in a very large expanse of sea. Ocean’s mother hires a lawyer for his hearing. After the hearing, Ocean avoids getting expelled from school, but he quits the basketball team. Shirin and Ocean spend the last few months of the school year together and happy, but at the end of the year, Shirin’s family moves again. Ocean stands in the street and watches Shirin and her family drive away. When he is no longer in sight and just when Shirin feels her heart will break, Ocean texts her, “Don’t give up on me.” The story ends with Shirin stating, “And I never did.”"
Rings,"The Fellowship of the Ring is the first of three volumes in The Lord of the Rings, an epic set in the fictional world of Middle-earth. The Lord of the Rings is an entity named Sauron, the Dark Lord, who long ago lost the One Ring that contains much of his power. His overriding desire is to reclaim the Ring and use it to enslave all of Middle-earth. 
The story of The Lord of the Rings begins with several events that take place in The Hobbit. While wandering lost in a deep cave, Bilbo Baggins, a Hobbit—one of a small, kindly race about half the size of Men—stumbles upon a ring and takes it back with him to the Shire, the part of Middle-earth that is the Hobbits’ home. All Bilbo knows of his ring is that wearing it causes him to become invisible. He is unaware that it is the One Ring, and is therefore oblivious to its significance and to the fact that Sauron has been searching for it.

The Fellowship of the Ring opens with a party for Bilbo’s 111th birthday. Bilbo gives his ring to his heir, his cousin Frodo Baggins. When the time comes to part with the ring, however, Bilbo becomes strangely reluctant to do so. He gives up the ring only at the determined urging of his friend, Gandalf the Grey, a great Wizard. Gandalf suspects that the ring is indeed the One Ring of legend. After confirming his suspicions, he tells Frodo that the Ring must be taken away from the Shire, as Sauron’s power is growing once again.
Frodo sets out from the Shire with three of his Hobbit friends—Sam, Merry, and Pippin. Along the way, they are pursued by the nine Ringwraiths, servants of Sauron who take the form of terrifying Black Riders. The hobbits spend a night in the company of wandering Elves, who promise to send word ahead to friends who will protect the hobbits. Barely out of the Shire, the hobbits get lost in the Old Forest, where they have to be rescued from a malevolent willow tree, which swallows up Merry and Pippin, and then from an evil tomb ghost. The hobbits’ rescuer is Tom Bombadil, a strange, jovial entity with great powers who is the oldest creature in Middle-earth.
The hobbits make it to the town of Bree, where they meet Aragorn, a Ranger who roams the wilderness and who is the heir of the Kings of the ancient Men of Westernesse. Those who do not know Aragorn’s true name call him Strider. Frodo tries to keep a low profile at the inn in Bree, but he ends up causing a scene when while taking part in a rollicking rendition of a song he falls, accidentally slips the Ring onto his finger, and vanishes.
That night, Aragorn advises the hobbits not to sleep in their rooms at the inn. In doing so, he saves their lives—for the first of many times. A letter Gandalf left at the inn months before advises the group to head for Rivendell, a realm of the Elves. Aragorn sets out with the hobbits the next day, and with his help they avoid the Black Riders for some time. However, at the top of the hill Weathertop, the Company is forced to defend itself against the attacking Riders. Frodo is wounded during the skirmish.
Frodo’s wound, made by a weapon of a servant of Sauron, plagues the hobbit as the Company makes its way eastward. Aragorn is greatly concerned about the power the wound might exert over Frodo. Near Rivendell they meet the Elf-lord Glorfindel, who has been out looking for them. At the last ford before Rivendell, Frodo, riding Glorfindel’s horse, outruns the ambushing Black Riders, who are swept away in a flood created by Elrond, the master of Rivendell.
Elrond heals Frodo and then holds a meeting to discuss what to do about the Ring. During this Council, Frodo learns the full history of the Ring. Frodo accepts the burden of taking the Ring to the only place it can be destroyed—the place where it was forged. It promises to be a long, nearly impossible journey, as the Ring was forged in the Cracks of Doom, part of the fiery mountain Orodruin in the very heart of Sauron’s realm of Mordor.
At the end of the meeting, the Council creates a group to help Frodo in his quest. In addition to Frodo, the Fellowship of the Ring includes Sam, Merry, Pippin, Aragorn, Gandalf, an Elf named Legolas, a Dwarf named Gimli, and a Man from the south named Boromir.
The Fellowship heads south and attempts to pass over the Misty Mountains via the pass of Caradhras. Their way is blocked by snow and rock slides, and they are forced to divert their path through the Mines of Moria—the ancient, underground realm of the Dwarves. During the journey through Moria, Gandalf falls into the chasm of Khazad-dûm while protecting the Company from a Balrog, a terrible demon.
The rest of the party continues on to Lórien, the forest of the Galadrim Elves, where the Lady Galadriel tests their hearts and gives them gifts to help them on the quest. Frodo, spellbound by Galadriel’s power and wisdom, offers her the Ring. She refuses, however, saying that, despite her intentions, the Ring would corrupt her; ultimately, she would only replace Sauron.
Leaving Lórien, the Fellowship travels by boat down the Great River, Anduin. At night, they spot Gollum—a deformed creature that had once owned the Ring but then lost it to Bilbo Baggins in The Hobbit—following them. When they reach the Falls of Rauros, the Fellowship must decide whether to head toward Mordor on the east or toward the safety of the city of Minas Tirith to the west.
Boromir, overcome by the Ring’s power and desiring the Ring for himself, confronts Frodo. Frodo fends off Boromir and decides that he must go on to Mordor rather than to the safety of Minas Tirith. However, Frodo cannot bear the thought of imperiling his friends on the dangerous journey or allowing the Ring to corrupt them, so he attempts to leave secretly and continue the quest alone. Frodo does not, however, manage to elude Sam, so the two of them set out together for Mordor."
Lower,"The Bottom is a mostly Black community in Ohio, situated in the hills above the mostly white, wealthier community of Medallion. The Bottom first became a community when a master gave it to his former slave. This ""gift"" was in fact a trick: the master gave the former slave a poor stretch of hilly land, convincing the slave the land was worthwhile by claiming that because it was hilly, it was closer to heaven. The trick, though, led to the growth of a vibrant community. Now the community faces a new threat; wealthy whites have taken a liking to the land, and would like to destroy much of the town in order to build a golf course.
Shadrack, a resident of the Bottom, fought in WWI. He returns a shattered man, unable to accept the complexities of the world; he lives on the outskirts of town, attempting to create order in his life. One of his methods involves compartmentalizing his fear of death in a ritual he invents and names National Suicide Day. The town is at first wary of him and his ritual, then, over time, unthinkingly accepts him.
Meanwhile, the families of the children Nel and Sula are contrasted. Nel is the product of a family that believes deeply in social conventions; hers is a stable home, though some might characterize it as rigid. Nel is uncertain of the conventional life her mother, Helene, wants for her; these doubts are hammered home when she meets Rochelle, her grandmother and a former prostitute, the only unconventional woman in her family line. Sula's family is very different: she lives with her grandmother, Eva, and her mother, Hannah, both of whom are seen by the town as eccentric and loose. Their house also serves as a home for three informally adopted boys and a steady stream of borders.
Despite their differences, Sula and Nel become fiercely attached to each other during adolescence. However, a traumatic accident changes everything. One day, Sula playfully swings a neighborhood boy, Chicken Little, around by his hands. When she loses her grip, the boy falls into a nearby river and drowns. They never tell anyone about the accident even though they did not intend to harm the boy. The two girls begin to grow apart. One day, in an accident, Sula's mother's dress catches fire and she dies of the burns.
After high school, Nel chooses to marry and settles into the conventional role of wife and mother. Sula follows a wildly divergent path and lives a life of fierce independence and total disregard for social conventions. Shortly after Nel's wedding, Sula leaves the Bottom for a period of 10 years. She has many affairs, some with white men. However, she finds people following the same boring routines elsewhere, so she returns to the Bottom and to Nel.
Upon her return, the town regards Sula as the very personification of evil for her blatant disregard of social conventions. Their hatred in part rests upon Sula's interracial relationships, but is crystallized when Sula has an affair with Nel's husband, Jude, who subsequently abandons Nel. Ironically, the community's labeling of Sula as evil actually improves their own lives. Her presence in the community gives them the impetus to live harmoniously with one another. Nel breaks off her friendship with Sula. Just before Sula dies in 1940, they achieve a half-hearted reconciliation. With Sula's death, the harmony that had reigned in the town quickly dissolves.
In 1965, with the Bottom facing the prospect of the white golf course, Nel visits Eva in the nursing home. Eva accuses her of sharing the guilt for Chicken Little's death. Her accusation forces Nel to confront the unfairness of her judgment against Sula. Nel admits to herself that she had blamed his death entirely on Sula and set herself up as the ""good"" half of the relationship. Nel comes to realize that in the aftermath of Chicken Little's death she had too quickly clung to social convention in an effort to define herself as ""good."" Nel goes to the cemetery and mourns at Sula's grave, calling out Sula's name in sadness.
Sula is a novel about ambiguity. It questions and examines the terms ""good"" and ""evil,"" often demonstrating that the two often resemble one another. The novel addresses the confusing mysteries of human emotions and relationships, ultimately concluding that social conventions are inadequate as a foundation for living one's life. The novel tempts the reader to apply the diametrically opposed terms of ""good and evil,"" ""right and wrong"" to the characters and their actions, and yet simultaneously shows why it is necessary to resist such temptation. While exploring the ways in which people try to make meaning of lives filled with conflicts over race, gender, and simple idiosyncratic points of views, Sula resists easy answers, demonstrating the ambiguity, beauty, and terror of life, in both its triumphs and horrors."
Mentioned,"Lawyer Bryan Stevenson gives a first-person account of his decades helping marginalized Americans who have been unfairly and harshly punished by the U.S. criminal justice system, which disproportionately targets people of color and poor people. At the heart of Just Mercy is the story of Walter McMillian, a Black man who was framed for the murder of a girl named Ronda Morrison, convicted, and sent to death row. 
Stevenson alternates chapters about Walter with his personal reflections on our country’s history with racial disparity and issues around incarceration. Stevenson highlights other groups of vulnerable people who have been victimized by the criminal justice system and shares the stories of the prisoners he has helped over the years. The book also follows the growth of Stevenson’s nonprofit law project, the Alabama-based Equal Justice Initiative (EJI), through its expansion from focusing on death row prisoners to helping people sentenced to life without parole. Stevenson chronicles how EJI becomes a significant force in criminal justice reform.
In 1983 as a law student, Stevenson discovers his life’s passion when he interns with the Georgia-based Southern Prisoners Defense Committee and meets his first death row prisoner. After graduation Stevenson accepts a job with the organization to represent poor prisoners, including those in Alabama who lack any public defender. He meets Walter McMillian on Alabama’s death row. Walter owns a successful business but also transgresses racial boundaries when he has an affair with a white woman. Soon after the affair becomes public, the woman’s friend, Ralph Myers, accuses Walter of committing the unsolved murder of Ronda Morrison, which has outraged the community. Law enforcement, including a racist sheriff and the district attorney, eagerly pounces on this accusation, overlooking Walter’s alibi and a lack of evidence. Instead, they actively force Ralph to stick with his story even when he tries to recant. They coerce other false witness testimonies, and—as revealed years later—actively suppress evidence.
After Stevenson and the team at EJI unsuccessfully appeal Walter’s conviction, they launch their own investigation of the crime and uncover new evidence. They find witnesses who can prove the witnesses against Walter lied as well as financial records that indicate that one of these witnesses was paid to give false testimony. Stevenson and his team also petition for and receive all records from Walter’s trial. However, their big break comes when they receive a phone call from Ralph, who now wants to make amends. Ralph admits to lying about Walter and says he was threatened by law enforcement. Stevenson wins a hearing for Walter where he can present his new evidence: Ralph’s testimony, which is confirmed by health care workers and other inmates, as well as recordings of the law enforcement team threatening Ralph if he doesn’t frame Walter. 
While the judge refuses to grant Walter relief, Stevenson continues the appeal process through the Alabama courts. The district attorney asks outside agents to investigate the murder for which Walter was convicted, and the investigators determine that Walter had nothing to do with the crime. Six weeks later, the court invalidates Walter’s conviction. Stevenson and the State file a joint motion to dismiss the charges, and Walter is set free.
Throughout the process, Stevenson and Walter become close friends, and Stevenson helps Walter upon his release, including filing a civil suit on his behalf and offering him a place to stay. Walter works with Stevenson to share his story, giving interviews and speaking at legal conferences, and Walter is even featured in a documentary. Unfortunately, Walter is diagnosed with advancing dementia and is forced to rely on family and eventually a nursing facility for his care. He dies in 2013. Stevenson gives a eulogy at his funeral and shares all he learned from Walter, particularly that we must extend mercy to everyone, even those who have not earned it.
Interspersed with chapters chronicling Walter’s narrative are stories of Stevenson’s other clients and work. His closeness with these prisoners and their horrifying circumstances makes Stevenson more determined to help and causes him to reflect on abstract issues that nevertheless imbue the criminal justice system, like humanity and mercy. Stevenson focuses on several categories of vulnerable people who become trapped in the system, including mentally ill prisoners, disabled prisoners, and poor women who give birth to stillborn babies. 
Stevenson and his team at EJI also become increasingly focused on juvenile offenders who are sometimes tried as adults despite their young age. These offenders may be given de facto death sentences by being sentenced to life without parole and face perilous circumstances when they are housed in adult prisons. Stevenson illustrates how these prisoners retain their own humanity while being forced to live under inhumane conditions. He also discusses some of the qualities common among these types of prisoners: They are generally poor and disproportionately people of color, and most of them lack adequate legal counsel. The juveniles have horrific backgrounds of abuse and neglect.
Stevenson and his team at EJI also work to change the legal system to offer more protection to marginalized people. Several of his cases end up before the U.S. Supreme Court, and he succeeds in winning rulings that ban as unconstitutional the conviction of children to life without parole and the execution of people deemed incompetent from dementia or neurological disease. EJI works to raise public awareness of issues surrounding unfair incarceration, produces groundbreaking reports on racial issues, and sets up programs to help formerly incarcerated people adjust to life on the outside.
Stevenson also reflects on the issues that surround the criminal justice system. His time spent with prisoners awaiting their execution makes him realize how inhumane it is to prepare another human to die. After decades of work, when Stevenson fails to prevent the execution of a man who suffers from an intellectual disability, he momentarily feels unable to continue his work. However, he realizes that he cannot help but be broken by his experiences and comes to understand that it is his own brokenness that allows him to more fully understand the need for mercy and to bring compassion to others. The book ends with Stevenson’s renewed commitment to helping others."
Some,"Maus: A Survivor’s Tale is the illustrated true story of Vladek Spiegelman’s experiences during World War II, as told by his son, Artie. It consists of Book One: My Father Bleeds History, and Book Two: And Here My Troubles Began / From Mauschwitz to the Catskills and Beyond.
While the story is primarily focused on Vladek’s life, there is also a frame narrative (or, a story within the story) that shows Artie and his father interacting in the present, with Artie asking questions as Vladek relays his experiences. As Vladek describes the horrors that he faced as a Jewish person in World War II, there are interspersed scenes that reveal some of the challenges that Artie faces as the son of a concentration camp survivor. For example, Vladek is obsessive about money and constantly fusses over Artie’s clothes, decisions, and refusal to eat everything on his plate (even though Artie is an adult).
Except for a brief scene that depicts Artie as a human wearing a mouse mask, all of the people in the story appear as anthropomorphic animals. Jews are depicted as mice, Germans as cats, Poles as pigs, French as frogs, and Americans as dogs.
The story begins around 1978, with Artie visiting his father Vladek in New York City. Vladek looks frail and unhealthy; he’s had two heart attacks, and the suicide of his wife Anja (Artie’s mother) a decade earlier has taken a serious toll on him. Vladek is remarried to a woman named Mala with whom he constantly argues. Artie asks Vladek to tell him stories about life during World War II so that he can create a comic book based on Vladek’s experiences. 
Vladek starts his story in 1935, when he was living in Poland. After marrying Anja Zylberberg, Vladek moves to Sosnowiec, Poland, where her wealthy family helps them get established. Vladek and Anja have a son named Richieu, and Anja’s father, a millionaire, gives Vladek money to buy a factory in Bielsko. Vladek runs the factory during the week and returns home to Sosnowiec on the weekends to visit Anja and Richieu. Anja has a breakdown due to severe postpartum depression, and Vladek stays with her in a sanitarium in Czechoslovakia until she recovers. In 1939, Vladek is drafted into the Polish army and sent to the frontlines to fight the Nazis, where he is captured and becomes a prisoner of war. Vladek is eventually released back to Poland, and he returns to Anja and Richieu in Sosnoweic.
As the war continues, the Nazis begin rounding up Jewish people in Sosnowiec and sending them away on trains. Food and resources become scarce, and Vladek begins trading goods on the black market in order to provide for his family. Several of his friends are caught trading goods and executed. The Nazis later order that everyone report to the local stadium to have their papers verified; once there, many Jews are taken away for deportation. Luckily, Vladek’s cousin is working one of the tables at the stadium, and he is able to secure Vladek’s release, as well as Anja’s and her parents’. Vladek’s sister Fela, Fela’s four children, and Vladek’s father are not as fortunate—they are never seen again.
During one of Artie’s visits to help his father and record his stories about World War II, he finds out that his father read a comic he drew years before. The comic, Prisoner on the Hell Planet: A Case History, is included in Maus. It depicts Artie as a prisoner and shows the mental and emotional pain he endured because of his mother’s suicide in 1968.
Continuing on with his story, Vladek says that after leaving the stadium, he and his family were relocated to a ghetto in Srodula. In order to keep Richieu safe, Vladek and Anja send him to live with Anja’s sister Tosha in Zawiercie. They later find out that when Tosha discovered that she and the rest of the Jews in Zawiercie were going to be shipped to Auschwitz, she poisoned Richieu, herself, and her two children in order to spare them a worse fate at the camp.
When Vladek and Anja realize that the Germans are going to send everyone in the ghetto to concentration camps, they go into hiding to avoid capture. Once the ghetto is empty, Vladek and Anja begin to walk back to Sosnowiec. Along the way, they secure passage to Hungary with some smugglers, but the smugglers betray them and hand them over to the Germans. Vladek is sent to Auschwitz, and Anja is taken to Birkenau.
Vladek tells Artie that Anja kept diaries after the war, but Vladek destroyed them in a fit of grief. Artie becomes upset and yells at his father, saying that they would have had valuable information in them. At the beginning of Book Two, while Artie is staying with friends in Vermont, he receives a call from Vladek: Mala has left him and taken some of their shared valuables. Fearing that he will be responsible for taking care of his father, Artie goes to visit him in New York.
Vladek continues his story and describes the terrible conditions in Auschwitz. While working there, he uses his knowledge of trade skills to remain valuable and avoid execution. He learns that Anja is in the secondary camp, Auschwitz Birkenau, and arranges to do some repairs there so that he can see her. After hoarding the few resources available, Vladek bribes some of the Nazi guards to have Anja relocated to his camp to work in the munitions shop.
Vladek continues his story, describing the various ways that he used his skills and resourcefulness to help himself and Anja survive at Auschwitz. As the Russian army closes in on Auschwitz, Vladek is tasked with dismantling the gas chambers. All of the prisoners are eventually evacuated and relocated to Dachau, a camp in Germany. Vladek contracts typhus from the lice at Dachau and becomes very sick. He is sent toward Switzerland by train to be traded as a prisoner of war and is eventually rescued by American soldiers. After traveling back through Germany to Poland, he is reunited with Anja.
When Artie visits his father to hear the last of the story, Vladek is very sick. Mala has returned to help, but is still frustrated by Vladek. When Artie starts to leave, Vladek, confused and tired, calls him Richieu."
Tax,"Nick Carraway, a young man from Minnesota, moves to New York in the summer of 1922 to learn about the bond business. He rents a house in the West Egg district of Long Island, a wealthy but unfashionable area populated by the new rich, a group who have made their fortunes too recently to have established social connections and who are prone to garish displays of wealth. Nick’s next-door neighbor in West Egg is a mysterious man named Jay Gatsby, who lives in a gigantic Gothic mansion and throws extravagant parties every Saturday night.
Nick is unlike the other inhabitants of West Egg—he was educated at Yale and has social connections in East Egg, a fashionable area of Long Island home to the established upper class. Nick drives out to East Egg one evening for dinner with his cousin, Daisy Buchanan, and her husband, Tom, an erstwhile classmate of Nick’s at Yale. Daisy and Tom introduce Nick to Jordan Baker, a beautiful, cynical young woman with whom Nick begins a romantic relationship. Nick also learns a bit about Daisy and Tom’s marriage: Jordan tells him that Tom has a lover, Myrtle Wilson, who lives in the valley of ashes, a gray industrial dumping ground between West Egg and New York City. Not long after this revelation, Nick travels to New York City with Tom and Myrtle. At a vulgar, gaudy party in the apartment that Tom keeps for the affair, Myrtle begins to taunt Tom about Daisy, and Tom responds by breaking her nose.
As the summer progresses, Nick eventually garners an invitation to one of Gatsby’s legendary parties. He encounters Jordan Baker at the party, and they meet Gatsby himself, a surprisingly young man who affects an English accent, has a remarkable smile, and calls everyone “old sport.” Gatsby asks to speak to Jordan alone, and, through Jordan, Nick later learns more about his mysterious neighbor. Gatsby tells Jordan that he knew Daisy in Louisville in 1917 and is deeply in love with her. He spends many nights staring at the green light at the end of her dock, across the bay from his mansion. Gatsby’s extravagant lifestyle and wild parties are simply an attempt to impress Daisy. Gatsby now wants Nick to arrange a reunion between himself and Daisy, but he is afraid that Daisy will refuse to see him if she knows that he still loves her. Nick invites Daisy to have tea at his house, without telling her that Gatsby will also be there. After an initially awkward reunion, Gatsby and Daisy reestablish their connection. Their love rekindled, they begin an affair.
After a short time, Tom grows increasingly suspicious of his wife’s relationship with Gatsby. At a luncheon at the Buchanans’ house, Gatsby stares at Daisy with such undisguised passion that Tom realizes Gatsby is in love with her. Though Tom is himself involved in an extramarital affair, he is deeply outraged by the thought that his wife could be unfaithful to him. He forces the group to drive into New York City, where he confronts Gatsby in a suite at the Plaza Hotel. Tom asserts that he and Daisy have a history that Gatsby could never understand, and he announces to his wife that Gatsby is a criminal—his fortune comes from bootlegging alcohol and other illegal activities. Daisy realizes that her allegiance is to Tom, and Tom contemptuously sends her back to East Egg with Gatsby, attempting to prove that Gatsby cannot hurt him.
When Nick, Jordan, and Tom drive through the valley of ashes, however, they discover that Gatsby’s car has struck and killed Myrtle, Tom’s lover. They rush back to Long Island, where Nick learns from Gatsby that Daisy was driving the car when it struck Myrtle, but that Gatsby intends to take the blame. The next day, Tom tells Myrtle’s husband, George, that Gatsby was the driver of the car. George, who has leapt to the conclusion that the driver of the car that killed Myrtle must have been her lover, finds Gatsby in the pool at his mansion and shoots him dead. He then fatally shoots himself.
Nick stages a small funeral for Gatsby, ends his relationship with Jordan, and moves back to the Midwest to escape the disgust he feels for the people surrounding Gatsby’s life and for the emptiness and moral decay of life among the wealthy on the East Coast. Nick reflects that just as Gatsby’s dream of Daisy was corrupted by money and dishonesty, the American dream of happiness and individualism has disintegrated into the mere pursuit of wealth. Though Gatsby’s power to transform his dreams into reality is what makes him “great,” Nick reflects that the era of dreaming—both Gatsby’s dream and the American dream—is over."
Differing,"Refugee follows the stories of three different children and their families, each attempting to flee their violent homelands, in different regions of the world and during different decades. Josef and his family flee Nazi Germany in 1938; Isabel and her family flee Cuba in 1994; and Mahmoud and his family flee Syria in 2015.
Josef Landau is a twelve-year-old boy living in Berlin. In 1938, his home is raided by Nazi storm troopers, and his father is taken to the Dachau concentration camp. Six months later, his mother receives a telegram that her husband has been released, but the family must leave Germany immediately. Josef, his sister Ruth, and his mother all travel to Hamburg to board a ship that will take them to Cuba. When Josef’s father is reunited with his family, they notice that Dachau has changed him: he is paranoid and very thin. They board the St. Louis, a large German ship, and set out.
Aboard the St. Louis, Josef’s family and the other passengers, all Jewish refugees, are treated well by Captain Schroeder and most of the ship’s crew. A few of the crew, however, openly dislike the Jewish passengers, especially Otto Schiendick, who proudly states his Nazi allegiance. When the St. Louis reaches Havana Harbor in Cuba, the ship is not allowed to dock. Josef’s father’s mental state deteriorates further, and he eventually jumps from the ship, trying to kill himself. Officer Padron, a Cuban policeman assigned to the St. Louis, saves Josef’s father. Josef’s father is taken to Havana to recover. When Officer Padron returns to the St. Louis, he is treated like a hero by the Jewish passengers. 
Eventually, the captain announces that they are not going to be allowed to dock in Havana and that the boat will be leaving. He promises the passengers that he will try to deliver them to a country other than Germany. The refugees aboard the St. Louis are delivered to England, Belgium, the Netherlands, and France. The Nazis invade France just a few months after Josef’s family arrives there. When the family is eventually caught, Josef’s mother is forced to choose which of her children will be freed and which will be sent to a concentration camp.
Isabel Fernandez is an eleven-year-old girl who lives just outside Havana in 1994. After the fall of the Soviet Union, Cuba has become inhospitable for most of its citizens under the regime of Fidel Castro. Isabel’s best friend and neighbor, Iván, is building a small boat with his father so that his family can flee to America. After a riot in Havana, Isabel’s family decides that they should also leave Cuba immediately. Isabel trades her trumpet to a fisherman for gasoline, paying her family’s way onto Iván’s family’s boat. Lito, Isabel’s grandfather, also joins them. 
The two families face many challenges as they try to cross the Caribbean Sea to Florida. A storm sweeps them to the Bahamas, where they are not allowed to disembark; Iván is attacked by sharks and eventually bleeds to death in the boat; and toward the end of the journey, Isabel’s pregnant mother goes into labor. Lito tells the story of the St. Louis and how he had to turn away so many refugees when he was a young policeman. (He is Officer Padron from Josef’s story.) Just when Miami becomes visible on the horizon, a U.S. Coast Guard boat tries to intercept the two families. Lito jumps in the water to distract the Coast Guard, and Isabel’s mother gives birth to a boy, just as they reach the shore. When Isabel is asked to play a song at her new school in America, she plays a Cuban salsa version of “The Star-Spangled Banner.”
Mahmoud Bishara is a twelve-year-old boy who lives in Aleppo, Syria in 2015. For the last few years, there has been a war in his country between the Syrian government, rebels, the Soviets, the United States and several other factions. After Mahmoud’s home is destroyed, his brother Waleed, sister Hana, and his parents drive to the border of Turkey, hoping to escape. Mahmoud’s father tells them that Germany is accepting Syrian refugees and if they can get to Greece, they will be able to travel within the European Union to reach Germany. After a violent conflict between the rebels and the Syrian government, Mahmoud and his family walk to the Turkish border. Mahmoud’s father arranges for a smuggler to take them to the island of Lesbos, in Greece. The smuggler’s raft is destroyed by rocks as they cross the Mediterranean. Mahmoud hands his sister, Hana, to another passing raft of refugees, knowing that his mother cannot hold her and swim. The family is eventually pulled from the water by the Greek Coast Guard. 
Mahmoud and his family travel through Serbia and into Hungary, where they are detained at a refugee camp that is built like a prison. Mahmoud decides that he no longer wants to be ignored and leads the refugees out of the prison, walking twelve hours to Austria. The refugees are welcomed in Austria, and Mahmoud’s family takes a train to Germany. While they travel, they ask if anyone has seen Hana. After a few weeks in Munich, Mahmoud’s family is transferred to a host family in Berlin. An elderly couple, Herr and Frau Rosenberg, welcome them into their home. Frau Rosenberg takes Mahmoud aside and tells him the story of her childhood: she is Ruth, Josef’s sister. The night that they were captured in France, Josef volunteered to be taken by the Nazis; both Josef and their mother were killed in concentration camps. Ruth promises to help Mahmoud find Hana."
Reasoning,"The full title of Swift's pamphlet is ""A Modest Proposal for Preventing the Children of Poor People from Being a Burthen to their Parents, or the Country, and for Making them Beneficial to the Publick."" The tract is an ironically conceived attempt to ""find out a fair, cheap, and easy Method"" for converting the starving children of Ireland into ""sound and useful members of the Commonwealth."" Across the country poor children, predominantly Catholics, are living in squalor because their families are too poor to keep them fed and clothed.
The author argues, by hard-edged economic reasoning as well as from a self-righteous moral stance, for a way to turn this problem into its own solution. His proposal, in effect, is to fatten up these undernourished children and feed them to Ireland's rich land-owners. Children of the poor could be sold into a meat market at the age of one, he argues, thus combating overpopulation and unemployment, sparing families the expense of child-bearing while providing them with a little extra income, improving the culinary experience of the wealthy, and contributing to the overall economic well-being of the nation.
The author offers statistical support for his assertions and gives specific data about the number of children to be sold, their weight and price, and the projected consumption patterns. He suggests some recipes for preparing this delicious new meat, and he feels sure that innovative cooks will be quick to generate more. He also anticipates that the practice of selling and eating children will have positive effects on family morality: husbands will treat their wives with more respect, and parents will value their children in ways hitherto unknown. His conclusion is that the implementation of this project will do more to solve Ireland's complex social, political, and economic problems than any other measure that has been proposed."
Waves,"The Waves is a portrait of the intertwined lives of six friends: Bernard, Neville, Louis, Jinny, Susan, and Rhoda. The novel is divided into nine sections, each of which corresponds to a time of day, and, symbolically, to a period in the lives of the characters. Each section begins with a detailed description of the course of this symbolic day.
The first section deals with early morning, or childhood, when the six main characters are attending a day-school together. As each of the children awakens, he or she begins an internal monologue composed of thoughts, feelings, and impressions. The children interact in various ways throughout the day, and each begins to take shape as an individual in response to the stimulus provided by the world and by the presence of one another. Although their thoughts are somewhat incoherent and mostly fixated on immediate experience, their distinct personalities begin to emerge: Bernard’s loquacity and obsession with language; Neville’s desire for order and beauty; Louis’s insecurity and ambition; Jinny’s physicality; Susan’s intensity and attachment to nature; and Rhoda’s dreamlike abstraction from ordinary life.
The second section deals with adolescence, after the boys and girls have been sent off to their separate boarding schools. Bernard, Louis, and Neville differ in their reactions to the school’s authority and traditions, and they all form friendships with Percival, a popular, handsome boy who is to become a central figure in the lives of the six main characters. All three boys develop literary ambitions of some sort, though they differ markedly in their goals and expressions. The girls mostly want school to be over and done with: Jinny desires to begin her real life in society, Susan longs to return home to her father and her farm, and Rhoda wants an escape from the disruptions to her mental solitude caused by school. At the close of the section, each character sets out, whether for college, work, or otherwise, on a more solitary track.
The third section traces the characters through young adulthood. Bernard and Neville are at college together and remain close friends. They both admire Percival, but Neville has fallen in love with him. Percival has become the focus of Neville’s desire for beauty and perfection. Bernard is concerned with his own gregarious nature and thinks deeply about the way his personality is constructed out of his relationships with others. Neville shares one of his poems with Bernard, and the moment is important for both of them. Louis is working as a mid-level clerk at a shipping firm in London. He spends his lunch hour reading at a diner and people-watching, hoping to make poetry out of his observations of everyday life. Susan is at home on her farm and communes with the rhythm of natural life. She walks across the fields before dawn and senses growth all around her, though she begins to submerge her own active will. Back in London, Jinny and Rhoda attend the same party, though their experiences are very different. Jinny comes fully alive in the social setting, and she takes a great, sensual pleasure in the beauty of her surroundings and in her own personal attractiveness. Rhoda, on the other hand, feels negated by the others around her and longs to disappear.
The fourth section is set later in adulthood and centers on a dinner party, meant to honor Percival, who is leaving for a position in the colonial government in India. At the party, the six characters are united again. At first, the group is tense and uneasy in one another’s company, and they primarily notice their differences. When Percival arrives, however, these tensions are relaxed and the group comes together. Briefly, the friends are united in a moment of true communion, and their individual voices seem to blend. All too soon, however, the moment ends and the group dissolves back into its singular parts.
The fifth section takes place not long after the dinner party, when the friends have learned that Percival has been killed in India. Neville is devastated by the news, overwhelmed by a sense of death and the fragility of life. Bernard is torn between joy and sorrow: his child has just been born and his friend has just died. Bernard goes to a museum to look at paintings and finds a kind of solace, even as he is aware that his memories of Percival must inevitably fade. Rhoda finds a similar solace in music when she attends an opera soon after she learns of Percival’s death, and she finds the strength to go on for a time.
In the sixth section, the characters have entered full maturity. Louis is rising in his firm and leads a sort of double life. Although he is a respectable businessman, he is drawn to the seamier side of life and spends his time roaming around poorer neighborhoods. Louis and Rhoda have become lovers. Susan is a mother now, both deeply gratified and stifled by her chosen life. On one hand, she is fully a part of the cycle of natural life; on the other, her own life has become subordinate to the lives of her children and the ongoing life of the farm. Jinny continues her purely physical existence, taking lovers but never settling down, content to revel in her own being. Neville also moves from lover to lover, but in his case, he is trying to keep the intensity of first desire alive—it is the source of his creativity.
The seventh section deals with midlife, as the characters begin to age. Bernard has traveled to Rome, where he observes the ruins and tries to come to terms with his own sense of failure, as he has begun to doubt both his own abilities and the ability of stories to capture reality. As Susan sinks deeper into her rural and domestic life, she regrets what she has lost even as she finds a measure of contentment in what she has gained. Jinny has a moment of dread in which she sees that she is aging and her beauty is fading. She reconciles herself to the inevitable passage of time, however, and resolves to make the most of her remaining years. Neville is becoming a successful writer. He is mellowing a bit, but he continues to shift the focus of his desire from lover to lover. Louis rises ever higher in his firm but still returns to his attic room to write. Literature seems to him an idealized realm even as his eye is continually drawn to the street. Rhoda has left Louis and travels to Spain, where she too has a moment in which she comes face to face with death—here in the form of the vast sea seen from the cliffs.
In the eighth section, the friends once again gather for a dinner, though this time the meeting is shadowed by death, thanks both to their increasing age and to the absence of Percival. Although there is tension among the friends, as at the earlier meeting, this tension is resolved as they begin to share their common experiences. The characters have lived long enough to know that this meeting is one such common experience, and they have another moment of silent communion, though the moment is elegiac rather than triumphant. Rhoda and Louis have a quiet moment together as the others walk into the park, but it inevitably comes to an end.
The ninth and final section is told entirely from Bernard’s point of view. Bernard speaks to a casual acquaintance over dinner, and tries to give a “summing up” of his life. Bernard is still doubtful about the accuracy of any representation of reality through language. He tries to give a sense of the texture of his life, rather than making sweeping statements about it. Bernard discusses the others and how things have turned out for them, including the fact that Rhoda has killed herself. The most profound moment Bernard describes is one in which he himself seems to move beyond language into a direct perception of reality. In the end, however, Bernard sees his life as an attempt to use language to fight against death, and he sees how the others have, in their individual ways, been part of the same struggle. Bernard vows to keep fighting until the end."
Levy,"Primo Levi’s memoir depicts life and death in the final days of the Auschwitz concentration camp complex from his incarceration in February 1944 to the Soviet liberation of the camp in January 1945. At the time of Levi’s arrest as a Jew under the Italian Racial Laws, World War II had been in progress since September 1939. The Nazis’ forced labor camps filled the gaps in their dwindling workforce on the home front to continue the war effort.
Levi is one of 650 Italians deported to Auschwitz as part of that labor force. Once in Poland, the train stops on a deserted plain and the young and fit are separated from the children, the old, and the sick. A total of ninety-six men and twenty-nine women board trucks bound for the respective camps of Monowitz-Buna and Birkenau in the Auschwitz complex, and the other 500 are killed. Intake at the Monowitz-Buna camp involves the seizure of all their belongings, the shaving of their heads, and the tattooing of identification numbers on their arms. Prisoners are assigned to blocks where pairs share narrow bunks. The daily routine is enforced by a cacophony of shouting in a variety of languages as well as beatings. Each man is assigned to a work squad. Some work sites are located kilometers away from the barracks where private corporations maintain plants to utilize the slave labor. The prisoners walk to these sites in their prison-issue cotton shirts, jackets, and wooden clogs in below-freezing weather. Hunger is constant, to the point that the men dream of food and make eating movements in their sleep.
When Levi has a job injury, he spends a few weeks in the Ka-Be infirmary. There he learns of the process of selection to send those no longer able to work to the gas chambers in Birkenau. He finds out that Ka-Be is the center of an extensive barter system. All personal belongings of those admitted are confiscated for later use to barter for medical supplies, which are stolen from the private corporation worksites by prisoners looking to improve their quality of life. Levi analyzes the complex political and economic system in the camp alongside the dynamic of the antipathy existing between the German political soldiers of the Nazi Party (SS) and the industrialists. At the center of the book, he lays out the personal qualities and strategies that improve a prisoner’s chances of survival. The book will go on to present lessons in working the system.
Levi’s own turning point comes with an appointment to the Chemical Kommando, a squad of chemists tasked with supporting the Buna synthetic rubber plant. He develops friendships and continues to upgrade his survival skills. An influx of Hungarian internees in the spring creates overcrowding conditions. In June and July, the inmates feel fleeting hope hearing news of developments in the war: the Allies’ landing in Normandy; the Russian offensive; and a failed attempt to assassinate Hitler. In August, the Allies begin bombing the area of Poland where Auschwitz is situated and continue throughout the fall. The bombardments halt work on the Buna rubber plant. In October, the German SS commandant conducts a selection to deal with overcrowded conditions in the blocks. This involves sorting the thousands of prisoners in the camp into two categories: those who are sent to die in the gas chambers at Birkenau, and those who are spared. Levi and his best friend, Alberto, are spared.
A group of subversive prisoners blow up a crematorium in Birkenau. In November, Levi is chosen as one of three prisoner chemists to work in the Buna laboratory as the Germans gear up once again to begin production of the rubber. Civilian prisoners have brought scarlet fever, diphtheria, and typhus into the camp population. Toward the end of December, the German SS holds a public hanging for the one prisoner who hasn’t already been executed for the crematorium destruction. Levi feels ashamed because, despite he and Alberto’s organized schemes to collect large amounts of food and clothing, they have still let the Germans defeat their spirits.
On January 11, Levi comes down with scarlet fever and is admitted to the infectious disease ward of the Ka-Be infirmary with twelve other patients in various stages of scarlet fever, diphtheria, and typhus. With the Soviet troops advancing, the Germans evacuate Auschwitz early on January 18, taking the fit and leaving the sick behind. Alberto leaves with the healthy prisoners, never to be seen by Levi again. Bombardments begin that day, destroying parts of the complex around the infirmary. From January 18 through 20, the prisoners watch the Wehrmacht fleeing the oncoming Soviet army. The Soviet army enters the camp on January 27 and sets up a temporary hospital to care for the survivors. Levi ends his memoir with an epitaph for the men who shared the last ten days as a team of survivors."
Approved,"Educated is primarily retrospective, consisting of Tara Westover's memories about her past. She tells the story of the events of her life from a vantage point in her late twenties, occasionally interjecting to comment on the process of trying to arrive at an accurate version of the past. Tara was born the youngest of seven children to parents whom she refers to as Faye and Gene (pseudonyms). The Westover family lived on a farm in rural Idaho, where Gene made a living salvaging scrap metal while Faye worked as an unlicensed midwife and herbal healer. Gene suffered from paranoid fears about interference from the federal government, and as a result he refused to allow his children to attend school, receive birth certificates, or receive medical attention. Gene was also a devout Mormon who believed in radical self-sufficiency and an impending Day of Judgement.
		
Shifts in the Westover family dynamic began to emerge when Tara was about nine. Her mother's work as a midwife increased her sense of independence, but after sustaining a serious and untreated brain injury in a car accident, Faye began to lose confidence in her skills, and focused instead on using herbal remedies and a form of intuitive healing. Around this time, Tyler (the third son) announced that he was going to attend college, which estranged him from his family. Tyler's absence forced Tara to become more involved in helping her father with his scrapping work, which left her constantly exposed to the possibility of dangerous injury. It also made her more curious about possibly pursuing an education herself. When Tara was ten, she told her disapproving father that she wanted to begin going to school, but nothing came of the idea.
As Tara grew into her teens, she acquired more independence from her family due to taking on various jobs and pursuing singing and musical theatre in the local community. However, her life was dominated by the strict rules and religious doctrine her father imposed, and Tara often worried about becoming sinful. When Tara was thirteen, her older brother Shawn moved back home. At first Shawn and Tara were close and spent a lot of time together. When Tara was about fifteen, however, Shawn began to be physically abusive toward her. His behavior only got worse after Shawn experienced a head injury. Tyler eventually realized that Shawn was hurting Tara, and he urged Tara to seriously consider applying to college and getting away from the family. Although she was uncertain at first, Tara began to study and was eventually accepted at Brigham Young University, having passed herself off as homeschooled.
In January 2004, when Tara was seventeen years old, she moved to Utah to begin her college education. She found the adjustment very difficult at first, but eventually began to excel in her studies. Tara's finances were precarious, and she had to hold multiple jobs and maintain very high grades to retain her scholarship. Her emerging independence also caused a threatening dynamic between her, Gene, and Shawn. Whenever Tara returned to Buck's Peak, her father manipulated her into working for him, while Shawn continued to physically and emotionally abuse her. Tara eventually confided to a bishop about her life, and he helped her to secure funding to finance her education. Tara's studies, and the people she met, also gradually opened her eyes to different realities and force her to realize how damaging and isolating her childhood has been. Tara eventually changed her major to studying history, and is encouraged to apply for a study abroad program at Cambridge University in England.
Tara's experience at Cambridge broadened her horizons even further, and she was encouraged to consider graduate studies. Tara still felt isolated from her peers, and ashamed of her origins. She hid most of her past even from her friends and the men she occasionally dated. She was eventually awarded a prestigious Cambridge Gates Fellowship and moved to England to pursue a Master's degree. She remained in close contact with her family and returned to Idaho regularly to visit, but her relationship with them deteriorated. Shawn was growing increasingly erratic and violent, and Tara feared for the safety of his wife and young child. By chance, she revealed to her sister Audrey that Shawn had been abusive with her, and Audrey later confided that Shawn abused her as well. Audrey blamed herself for not protecting her younger sister, and suggested that she and Tara confront their parents and Shawn about what happened to them.
By then Tara had built a happy life for herself in England, and was working on a PhD in history at Cambridge. However, the attempt to speak the truth quickly became a source of conflict in the family. Tara became more and more ostracized within her family, eventually culminating in Shawn learning that she had been telling their parents about the abuse she suffered. Realizing her family would never trust her claims, Tara became estranged from most of them, with the exception of Tyler.  The estrangement from her family prompted grief and depression for Tara, but she was finally able to heal, and successfully completed her PhD. By the end of her memoir, Tara has accepted that she may never have a relationship with her family again, but she takes pride in the independence she has established, and the life she has built for herself."
Consult,"Susanna Kaysen, an eighteen-year-old in April of 1967, agrees to enter McLean Hospital, a residential psychiatric facility in Massachusetts. Although she plans to stay only a few weeks, Kaysen remains at McLean for nearly two years. The doctor who forcefully advocates her committal to a mental hospital interviewed Kaysen for only twenty minutes.
Kaysen tells the story of the people and experiences she encounters at McLean in a series of nonchronological vignettes. Among the patients admitted to her ward, Kaysen describes Polly, a kind patient with disfiguring, self-inflicted burns to her face and body. Lisa, another patient, entertains Kaysen with her escape attempts and exaggerated contempt for hospital authorities. Kaysen’s roommate, Georgina, struggles to maintain a relationship with Wade, a violent and unstable boyfriend from another ward, who tells the girls seemingly outlandish stories about his father’s exploits with the CIA. The twin obsessions of roasted chicken and laxatives make a newly arrived patient named Daisy the object of much speculation. Daisy ultimately leaves the hospital, only to commit suicide on her birthday.
One day, James Watson, a Nobel laureate and friend of the Kaysen family, visits Kaysen. He offers to take her away from the cold, prisonlike facility, but she rejects the offer, convinced that she should stay the course of her treatment. Kaysen discloses an unsuccessful suicide attempt involving an aspirin overdose in high school. She considers the nature of her illness, which includes difficulty making visual sense of patterns, and wonders whether sanity is merely an illusion that people construct to feel “normal.” Because many famous people have been residents of McLean Hospital, Kaysen speculates that creative minds, especially poets’, may be prone to mental illness.
The hospital’s strict rules dictate patients’ daily routines. Nurses perform “checks,” periodic visual appraisals of a patient’s activities and whereabouts, according to a schedule that corresponds to the severity of the patient’s illness. The staff confiscates any possessions that might inflict injury, even earrings and belts. Field trips outside the hospital walls are rare and require a complex system of patient-to-nurse accompaniment. 
Lisa Cody, a new patient, arrives and threatens the social position of a current resident, also named Lisa, who torments the new girl until she leaves McLean and falls into more desperate circumstances. At this point, Kaysen considers the twenty-minute consultation that resulted in her hospitalization. Analysis of hospital records is inconclusive, and Kaysen’s doubts about the accuracy of her memory leads her into a discussion of the nature of mental illness, which Kaysen believes falls into two categories: slow or “viscous” and fast or having “velocity.” Kaysen believes that both kinds of illness result in the same type of mental paralysis.
Kaysen introduces us to Valerie, the young head nurse, who wins the girls’ respect with her no-nonsense approach to the job and a willingness to stand up to the doctors. Dr. Wick, an older psychiatrist, has trouble relating to the youth culture of her patients and becomes uncomfortable during any discussion of sex. The girls uniformly detest Mrs. McWeeney, the evening nurse, who is decidedly old-fashioned in her dress, speech, and insistence on strict authority. 
The year 1968 is an exciting and frightening year, and Kaysen and the other girls watch its tumultuous events unfold on television. Simply viewing the world’s turbulence temporarily calms them. The girls come to realize that they are sitting on the sidelines of the era’s events and their own lives.
Torrey, a methamphetamine addict from Mexico, arrives on the ward. Torrey’s parents are embarrassed by their daughter’s problems. When Torrey’s parents come to retrieve her, Lisa attempts to help her escape her parents, but Valerie doses Torrey with Thorazine to foil the plan. The other girls fall into a depression. Kaysen suffers an episode of depersonalization that leads her to attempt to tear open her hand to confirm that she has bones beneath the skin.
Kaysen’s wisdom tooth becomes infected, and Valerie takes her from McLean to a dentist in Boston. Kaysen becomes frantic when, upon waking from the general anesthesia, no one will tell her how long she was unconscious. She worries that she has “lost” time. 
A new patient named Alice Calais enters the ward, but a mental breakdown leads to her transfer to maximum security. The girls visit Alice, whose condition and living arrangements sicken them. They vow never to let the same thing happen to them. Kaysen starts sessions with Melvin, a therapist with whom she begins an advanced form of analysis. Enthralled with the tunnels below the hospital, Kaysen struggles to convey their meaning to Melvin. She discovers she is Melvin’s first patient, and then she gladly leaves analysis behind. 
As Kaysen heals, she searches for a job outside the hospital, quickly becoming acquainted with the widespread prejudice that haunts former mental patients. Even applying for telephone service or a driver’s license requires a doctor’s note. Kaysen resumes a relationship she began with a man she knew before entering the hospital and impulsively accepts his marriage proposal. Reflecting on the difference between the mind and the brain, Kaysen wonders whether doctors treat one at the expense of the other. She reveals her diagnosis: borderline personality disorder. Dissecting the medical definition of the disorder, Kaysen notes that it is much more commonly diagnosed in women than in men. She wonders to what degree sexism and psychiatric fads influence the diagnoses. 
Some years after leaving McLean, Kaysen visits Georgina, now married and as eccentric as ever. Kaysen also runs into Lisa, who has a young child and lives in a respectable suburb. Kaysen detects traces of Lisa’s old personality beneath the persona of a suburban mother. In the final chapter, Kaysen reveals the origin of the title of the book, Girl, Interrupted. Separated by some twenty years, Kaysen stands in front of the painting at New York’s Frick Museum. The painting holds very different meanings on each occasion; the changing interpretation reflects Kaysen’s life experience."
And,"Between the World and Me is a letter written in three parts. Coates writes directly to his son Samori. Coates is forty years old, and Samori is fifteen. The text is not set up as a traditional narrative. Rather, it traces Coates’ thoughts and feelings throughout his life so far. It is loosely chronological though sometimes interrupted with anecdotes out of chronological order. The plot has less to do with specific events and more to do with the way Coates’ thoughts and opinions change over time.
Part I begins in the present, as a host for a news show interviews Coates. She asks Coates what it means to lose his body, and he answers her with all the knowledge he has gained over the years. Coates turns to his childhood, describing his life and family as he was growing up in the ghettos of West Baltimore. He first understands the gap between his Black world and the suburban white world in childhood, though he cannot articulate the reasons for the separation. Coates begins to give form to his thoughts by reading the many books on Africana that his father owns. He develops a belief system similar to that of Malcolm X and disagrees with the idea of non-violent protests.
Coates attends Howard University, and he evolves his beliefs significantly during this time. He constantly studies, reads, and questions everything. He turns to Chancellor Williams’ The Destruction of Black Civilization as his main guidebook. He begins to think of Black people as “kings in exile,” severed from their nation by plundering Europeans, and keeps a mental trophy case of African heroes. Debating with older poets and his teachers challenges his views, which leads Coates to journalism. He starts to think about Black history more objectively and less romantically. At Howard, he meets Kenyatta Matthews, and she becomes pregnant at twenty-four. He leaves Howard without a degree and moves with Kenyatta to Delaware, where he works as a freelance writer.
The main event in Part II is the police murder of Prince Jones, whom Coates met at Howard. This is an episode of police brutality in which the officer is not charged. Coates begins to write about Jones’ murder and develops a rage at both the police and all of white America. Coates’ family moves to New York City in 2001, and Coates finds himself unable to sympathize with the victims of the September 11 terrorist attack because he views them all as part of the system that brought down Prince Jones. Coates describes his life in Brooklyn as a new father with young Samori. His thoughts revolve around Samori understanding the weight and struggle he will have to go through as a Black man. The second main event of Part II is a trip to France. Travel opens Coates’ eyes to worlds outside of America. He realizes how much fear has damaged his life, and is able to better place himself in the larger context of the world as a whole.
In Part III, Coates visits Prince Jones’ mother, Dr. Mable Jones. He is amazed by her composure and compares it to the steady determination of his grandmother and the protestors at sit-ins in the 1960s. Dr. Jones speaks about her own history and tells Coates more about Prince. After leaving, Coates sits in his car and rethinks his views of non-violent protestors. He used to think they were shameful not to fight for themselves, but he now believes they may have known that there was never any security to fight for in the first place. He reflects on attending Howard University’s homecoming and the sense of Black power he felt within that group of people. His parting message to his son is to remind Samori to engage fully in the struggle of his life as a Black person, but to know he is not responsible for converting white people to the struggle. Coates is confident that white America will continue to plunder not only Black bodies but the environment, too. The text thus begins and ends discussing the white assault against the Black body."
Severe,"Frederick Douglass was born into slavery sometime in 1817 or 1818. Like many enslaved people, he is unsure of his exact date of birth. Douglass is separated from his mother, Harriet Bailey, soon after he is born. His father is most likely their white master, Captain Anthony. Captain Anthony is the clerk of a rich man named Colonel Lloyd. Lloyd enslaves hundreds of men, women, and children, who call his large, central plantation the “Great House Farm.” Life on any of Lloyd’s plantations, like that on many Southern plantations, is brutal. Those enslaved are overworked and exhausted, receive little food, few articles of clothing, and no beds. Those who break rules—and even those who do not—are beaten or whipped, and sometimes even shot by the plantation overseers, the cruelest of which are Mr. Severe and Mr. Austin Gore. 
Douglass’s life on this plantation is not as hard as that of most of the others. Being a child, he serves in the household instead of in the fields. At the age of seven, he is given to Captain Anthony’s son‑in‑law’s brother, Hugh Auld, who lives in Baltimore. In Baltimore, Douglass enjoys a relatively freer life. In general, city slave-owners are more conscious of appearing cruel or neglectful toward those they enslave in front of their non‑slaveowning neighbors.
Sophia Auld, Hugh’s wife, has never ""owned"" enslaved people before, and therefore she is surprisingly kind to Douglass at first. She even begins to teach Douglass to read, until her husband orders her to stop, saying that education makes enslaved people unmanageable. Eventually, Sophia succumbs to the mentality of slaveowning and loses her natural kindliness. Though Sophia and Hugh Auld become crueler toward him, Douglass still likes Baltimore and is able to teach himself to read with the help of local boys. As he learns to read and write, Douglass becomes conscious of the evils of slavery and of the existence of the abolitionist, or antislavery, movement. He resolves to escape to the North eventually.
After the deaths of Captain Anthony and his remaining heirs, Douglass is taken back to serve Thomas Auld, Captain Anthony’s son‑in‑law. Auld is a mean man made harsher by his false religious piety. Auld considers Douglass unmanageable, so Auld rents him for one year to Edward Covey, a man known for “breaking” enslaved people. Covey manages, in the first six months, to work and whip all the spirit out of Douglass. Douglass becomes a brutish man, no longer interested in reading or freedom, capable only of resting from his injuries and exhaustion. The turning point comes when Douglass resolves to fight back against Covey. The two men have a two‑hour fight, after which Covey never touches Douglass again.
His year with Covey over, Douglass is next rented to William Freeland for two years. Though Freeland is a milder, fairer man, Douglass’s will to escape is nonetheless renewed. At Freeland’s, Douglass begins educating his fellow enslaved people in a Sabbath school at the homes of free Black people. Despite the threat of punishment and violence they face, many enslaved people from neighboring farms come to Douglass and work diligently to learn. At Freeland’s, Douglass also forms a plan of escape with three fellow enslaved men with whom he is close. Someone betrays their plan to Freeland, however, and Douglass and the others are taken to jail. Thomas Auld then sends Douglass back to Baltimore with Hugh Auld, to learn the trade of ship caulking.
In Baltimore’s trade industry, Douglass runs up against strained race relations. White workers have been working alongside free Black workers, but the whites have begun to fear that the increasing numbers of free Black people will take their jobs. Though only an apprentice and still enslaved, Douglass encounters violent tactics of intimidation from his white coworkers and is forced to switch shipyards. In his new apprenticeship, Douglass quickly learns the trade of caulking and soon earns the highest wages possible, always turning them over to Hugh Auld.
Eventually, Douglass receives permission from Hugh Auld to hire out his extra time. He saves money bit by bit and eventually makes his escape to New York. Douglass refrains from describing the details of his escape in order to protect the safety of future slaves who may attempt the journey. In New York, Douglass fears recapture and changes his name from Bailey to Douglass. Soon after, he marries Anna Murray, a free woman he met while in Baltimore. They move north to Massachusetts, where Douglass becomes deeply engaged with the abolitionist movement as both a writer and an orator."
Dignifies,"Blanche DuBois, a schoolteacher from Laurel, Mississippi, arrives at the New Orleans apartment of her sister, Stella Kowalski. Despite the fact that Blanche seems to have fallen out of close contact with Stella, she intends to stay at Stella’s apartment for an unspecified but likely lengthy period of time, given the large trunk she has with her. Blanche tells Stella that she lost Belle Reve, their ancestral home, following the death of all their remaining relatives. She also mentions that she has been given a leave of absence from her teaching position because of her bad nerves.
Though Blanche does not seem to have enough money to afford a hotel, she is disdainful of the cramped quarters of the Kowalskis’ two-room apartment and of the apartment’s location in a noisy, diverse, working-class neighborhood. Blanche’s social condescension wins her the instant dislike of Stella’s husband, an auto-parts supply man of Polish descent named Stanley Kowalski. It is clear that Stella was happy to leave behind her the social pretensions of her background in exchange for the sexual gratification she gets from her husband; she even is pregnant with his baby. Stanley immediately distrusts Blanche to the extent that he suspects her of having cheated Stella out of her share of the family inheritance. In the process of defending herself to Stanley, Blanche reveals that Belle Reve was lost due to a foreclosed mortgage, a disclosure that signifies the dire nature of Blanche’s financial circumstances. Blanche’s heavy drinking, which she attempts to conceal from her sister and brother-in-law, is another sign that all is not well with Blanche.
The unhappiness that accompanies the animal magnetism of Stella and Stanley’s marriage reveals itself when Stanley hosts a drunken poker game with his male friends at the apartment. Blanche gets under Stanley’s skin, especially when she starts to win the affections of his close friend Mitch. After Mitch has been absent for a while, speaking with Blanche in the bedroom, Stanley erupts, storms into the bedroom, and throws the radio out of the window. When Stella yells at Stanley and defends Blanche, Stanley beats her. The men pull him off, the poker game breaks up, and Blanche and Stella escape to their upstairs neighbor Eunice’s apartment. A short while later, Stanley is remorseful and cries up to Stella to forgive him. To Blanche’s alarm, Stella returns to Stanley and embraces him passionately. Mitch meets Blanche outside of the Kowalski flat and comforts her in her distress.
The next day, Blanche tries to convince Stella to leave Stanley for a better man whose social status equals Stella’s. Blanche suggests that she and Stella contact a millionaire named Shep Huntleigh for help escaping from New Orleans; when Stella laughs at her, Blanche reveals that she is completely broke. Stanley walks in as Blanche is making fun of him and secretly overhears Blanche and Stella’s conversation. Later, he threatens Blanche with hints that he has heard rumors of her disreputable past. She is visibly dismayed.
While Blanche is alone in the apartment one evening, waiting for Mitch to pick her up for a date, a teenage boy comes by to collect money for the newspaper. Blanche doesn’t have any money for him, but she hits on him and gives him a lustful kiss. Soon after the boy departs, Mitch arrives, and they go on their date. When Blanche returns, she is exhausted and clearly has been uneasy for the entire night about the rumors Stanley mentioned earlier. In a surprisingly sincere heart-to-heart discussion with Mitch, Blanche reveals the greatest tragedy of her past. Years ago, her young husband committed suicide after she discovered and chastised him for his homosexuality. Mitch describes his own loss of a former love, and he tells Blanche that they need each other.
When the next scene begins, about one month has passed. It is the afternoon of Blanche’s birthday. Stella is preparing a dinner for Blanche, Mitch, Stanley, and herself, when Stanley comes in to tell her that he has learned news of Blanche’s sordid past. He says that after losing the DuBois mansion, Blanche moved into a fleabag motel from which she was eventually evicted because of her numerous sexual liaisons. Also, she was fired from her job as a schoolteacher because the principal discovered that she was having an affair with a teenage student. Stella is horrified to learn that Stanley has told Mitch these stories about Blanche.
The birthday dinner comes and goes, but Mitch never arrives. Stanley indicates to Blanche that he is aware of her past. For a birthday present, he gives her a one-way bus ticket back to Laurel. Stanley’s cruelty so disturbs Stella that it appears the Kowalski household is about to break up, but the onset of Stella’s labor prevents the imminent fight.
Several hours later, Blanche, drunk, sits alone in the apartment. Mitch, also drunk, arrives and repeats all he’s learned from Stanley. Eventually Blanche confesses that the stories are true, but she also reveals the need for human affection she felt after her husband’s death. Mitch tells Blanche that he can never marry her, saying she isn’t fit to live in the same house as his mother. Having learned that Blanche is not the chaste lady she pretended to be, Mitch tries to have sex with Blanche, but she forces him to leave by yelling “Fire!” to attract the attention of passersby outside.
Later, Stanley returns from the hospital to find Blanche even more drunk. She tells him that she will soon be leaving New Orleans with her former suitor Shep Huntleigh, who is now a millionaire. Stanley knows that Blanche’s story is entirely in her imagination, but he is so happy about his baby that he proposes they each celebrate their good fortune. Blanche spurns Stanley, and things grow contentious. When she tries to step past him, he refuses to move out of her way. Blanche becomes terrified to the point that she smashes a bottle on the table and threatens to smash Stanley in the face. Stanley grabs her arm and says that it’s time for the “date” they’ve had set up since Blanche’s arrival. Blanche resists, but Stanley uses his physical strength to overcome her, and he carries her to bed. The pulsing music indicates that Stanley rapes Blanche.
The next scene takes place weeks later, as Stella and her neighbor Eunice pack Blanche’s bags. Blanche is in the bath, and Stanley plays poker with his buddies in the front room. A doctor will arrive soon to take Blanche to an insane asylum, but Blanche believes she is leaving to join her millionaire. Stella confesses to Eunice that she simply cannot allow herself to believe Blanche’s assertion that Stanley raped her. When Blanche emerges from the bathroom, her deluded talk makes it clear that she has lost her grip on reality.
The doctor arrives with a nurse, and Blanche initially panics and struggles against them when they try to take her away. Stanley and his friends fight to subdue Blanche, while Eunice holds Stella back to keep her from interfering. Mitch begins to cry. Finally, the doctor approaches Blanche in a gentle manner and convinces her to leave with him. She allows him to lead her away and does not look back or say goodbye as she goes. Stella sobs with her child in her arms, and Stanley comforts her with loving words and caresses."
Locate,"Stanley Yelnats, a boy who has bad luck due to a curse placed on his great- great-grandfather, is sent to Camp Green Lake, a juvenile detention camp, for a crime he did not commit. Stanley and the other boys at the camp are forced to dig large holes in the dirt every day. Stanley eventually realizes that they are digging these holes because the Warden is searching for something. As Stanley continues to dig holes and meet the other boys at the camp, the narrator intertwines three separate stories to reveal why Stanley's family has a curse and what the Warden is looking for.
When he was a boy, Stanley's great-great-grandfather, Elya Yelnats, received a pig from Madame Zeroni, a gypsy, in exchange for a promise. Elya's promise was that after the pig grew strong he would carry Madame Zeroni, who only had one leg, up a mountain and sing her a song that she had taught him. After becoming disillusioned with the girl he thought he loved, however, Elya hops a boat to America, forgetting his promise to Madame Zeroni. Elya marries and has a child in America and always thinks about Madame Zeroni, who he believes has cursed him because of his failure to fulfill his promise. He knows that Madame Zeroni's son lives in America, but Elya never finds him.
One hundred and ten years before Stanley arrives at Camp Green Lake, the town of Green Lake is a beautiful place where peach trees bloom throughout the spring. In this Texas town, the schoolteacher, Katherine Barlow, falls in love with Sam, the onion seller. Sam sells onions to eat and to use for medicinal purposes. While Katherine and Sam are alive, racism is institutionalized in the United States and it is against the law for a black man to kiss a white woman. Because Sam is black and Katherine is white, the people in the town become irate when they find that Katherine and Sam have kissed. Charles, or Trout, Walker, the richest man in town has always wanted to marry Katherine. He is already mad that Katherine does not wish to go out with him so when he finds out that she is in love with Sam he gathers the townspeople to burn the schoolhouse and attack Sam. Katherine seeks help from the local sheriff but instead finds that the sheriff, who makes lewd advances towards her, also wants to kill Sam. Katherine and Sam attempt to escape but their boat is destroyed while only half way across the lake and Sam is killed. Katherine is driven mad by her grief and becomes an outlaw known as Kissin' Kate Barlow. Her name refers to the fact that she kisses the men she kills, leaving a lipstick imprint of her lips on their faces. In her twenty years of robbing people in the west, she happens to rob Stanley's great- grandfather while he is on his way from New York to California. She buries Stanley's great-grandfather's money somewhere and even though Charles Walker and his wife Linda try to torture her into revealing its location, Kate dies before anyone can find out where the money is hidden. After the day that Sam is killed, rain stops falling on Green Lake and the lake dries up.
Because Green Lake dries up, the citizens of the town all move away and by the time that the land is serving as Camp Green Lake, the only people there are juvenile delinquents. Stanley has a hard time digging holes there due to the incredible heat and the hard, dry land. At one point Stanley digs up half of a lipstick tube that has the initials KB on it. Stanley knows that the Warden, who happens to be a descendent of Charles and Linda Walker, is interested in this find and he speculates that perhaps Kate Barlow used to live in the area. The other boys at the camp are tough and all have nicknames. Stanley tries to stay in the good graces of X-Ray, the obvious leader of the group but this becomes harder as Stanley becomes better friends with a boy named Zero. Although Stanley and Zero, also known as Hector Zeroni, do not know it, Hector is the great- great-great-grandson of Madame Zeroni. Zero eventually runs away from camp and Stanley, in an effort to save him, follows after a few days. The two help each other to reach the top of a big mountain, which turns out to be Sam's old onion field. Because Zero is very weak, Stanley carries him up this mountain. They survive on onions for more than a week and then return to camp, planning to search for Kate Barlow's treasure in the hole where Stanley found the lipstick tube.
Stanley and Zero find a suitcase that has the name Stanley Yelnats on it. Although the Warden attempts to take the suitcase from them, Stanley's lawyer, Ms. Morengo, arrives to say that Stanley has been proven innocent and Stanley and Hector are able to leave the camp with the suitcase. It turns out that the suitcase contains many valuable items and is in fact the same suitcase that Kate Barlow took from Stanley's great-grandfather, also named Stanley Yelnats, so many years ago.
At the end of the book, it seems that the Yelnats family curse is lifted. Hector is reunited with his mother, from whom he was separated many years ago and Stanley's father finally succeeds in inventing something: a cure for foot odor. While at Camp Green Lake, Stanley has improved his physical strength and his self-confidence in addition to making a true friend. While fate has so often seemed against Stanley, in the end it serves to help him, his family, and Hector."
Immense,"In a series of letters, Robert Walton, the captain of a ship bound for the North Pole, recounts to his sister back in England the progress of his dangerous mission. Successful early on, the mission is soon interrupted by seas full of impassable ice. Trapped, Walton encounters Victor Frankenstein, who has been traveling by dog-drawn sledge across the ice and is weakened by the cold. Walton takes him aboard ship, helps nurse him back to health, and hears the fantastic tale of the monster that Frankenstein created.
Victor first describes his early life in Geneva. At the end of a blissful childhood spent in the company of Elizabeth Lavenza (his cousin in the 1818 edition, his adopted sister in the 1831 edition) and friend Henry Clerval, Victor enters the university of Ingolstadt to study natural philosophy and chemistry. There, he is consumed by the desire to discover the secret of life and, after several years of research, becomes convinced that he has found it.
Armed with the knowledge he has long been seeking, Victor spends months feverishly fashioning a creature out of old body parts. One climactic night, in the secrecy of his apartment, he brings his creation to life. When he looks at the monstrosity that he has created, however, the sight horrifies him. After a fitful night of sleep, interrupted by the specter of the monster looming over him, he runs into the streets, eventually wandering in remorse. Victor runs into Henry, who has come to study at the university, and he takes his friend back to his apartment. Though the monster is gone, Victor falls into a feverish illness.
Sickened by his horrific deed, Victor prepares to return to Geneva, to his family, and to health. Just before departing Ingolstadt, however, he receives a letter from his father informing him that his youngest brother, William, has been murdered. Grief-stricken, Victor hurries home. While passing through the woods where William was strangled, he catches sight of the monster and becomes convinced that the monster is his brother’s murderer. Arriving in Geneva, Victor finds that Justine Moritz, a kind, gentle girl who had been adopted by the Frankenstein household, has been accused. She is tried, condemned, and executed, despite her assertions of innocence. Victor grows despondent, guilty with the knowledge that the monster he has created bears responsibility for the death of two innocent loved ones.
Hoping to ease his grief, Victor takes a vacation to the mountains. While he is alone one day, crossing an enormous glacier, the monster approaches him. The monster admits to the murder of William but begs for understanding. Lonely, shunned, and forlorn, he says that he struck out at William in a desperate attempt to injure Victor, his cruel creator. The monster begs Victor to create a mate for him, a monster equally grotesque to serve as his sole companion.
Victor refuses at first, horrified by the prospect of creating a second monster. The monster is eloquent and persuasive, however, and he eventually convinces Victor. After returning to Geneva, Victor heads for England, accompanied by Henry, to gather information for the creation of a female monster. Leaving Henry in Scotland, he secludes himself on a desolate island in the Orkneys and works reluctantly at repeating his first success. One night, struck by doubts about the morality of his actions, Victor glances out the window to see the monster glaring in at him with a frightening grin. Horrified by the possible consequences of his work, Victor destroys his new creation. The monster, enraged, vows revenge, swearing that he will be with Victor on Victor’s wedding night.
Later that night, Victor takes a boat out onto a lake and dumps the remains of the second creature in the water. The wind picks up and prevents him from returning to the island. In the morning, he finds himself ashore near an unknown town. Upon landing, he is arrested and informed that he will be tried for a murder discovered the previous night. Victor denies any knowledge of the murder, but when shown the body, he is shocked to behold his friend Henry Clerval, with the mark of the monster’s fingers on his neck. Victor falls ill, raving and feverish, and is kept in prison until his recovery, after which he is acquitted of the crime.
Shortly after returning to Geneva with his father, Victor marries Elizabeth. He fears the monster’s warning and suspects that he will be murdered on his wedding night. To be cautious, he sends Elizabeth away to wait for him. While he awaits the monster, he hears Elizabeth scream and realizes that the monster had been hinting at killing his new bride, not himself. Victor returns home to his father, who dies of grief a short time later. Victor vows to devote the rest of his life to finding the monster and exacting his revenge, and he soon departs to begin his quest.
Victor tracks the monster ever northward into the ice. In a dogsled chase, Victor almost catches up with the monster, but the sea beneath them swells and the ice breaks, leaving an unbridgeable gap between them. At this point, Walton encounters Victor, and the narrative catches up to the time of Walton’s fourth letter to his sister.
Walton tells the remainder of the story in another series of letters to his sister. Victor, already ill when the two men meet, worsens and dies shortly thereafter. When Walton returns, several days later, to the room in which the body lies, he is startled to see the monster weeping over Victor. The monster tells Walton of his immense solitude, suffering, hatred, and remorse. He asserts that now that his creator has died, he too can end his suffering. The monster then departs for the northernmost ice to die."
Seen,"All the Light We Cannot See traces the stories of three characters whose lives intersect during the bombing of the German-occupied French town of Saint-Malo in August 1944. Marie-Laure Leblanc grows up in Paris, where her father, Daniel Leblanc, works as a locksmith at the Museum of Natural History. As a young girl, Marie-Laure goes blind, but her father teaches her to navigate their neighborhood independently by building her a scale model of the neighborhood to learn from. In June 1940, when she is 12 years old, the threat of a German occupation of Paris grows too great to ignore. Marie-Laure and Daniel flee from Paris to Saint-Malo, where they move in with her great-uncle, Etienne, and his housekeeper, Madame Manec.
        
Unbeknownst to Marie-Laure, Daniel carries a potentially significant item with him when he leaves Paris. The Museum of Natural History owns a legendary diamond called the Sea of Flames. Under the threat of occupation, the museum directors make three copies. Three of the four stones are sent off with various staff members, including Daniel, while the final one remains at the Museum. No one knows if the stone they possess is real or a copy. Once in Saint-Malo, Daniel works to build a scale model of the town so that Marie-Laure can learn to navigate it, and he also hides the diamond in the replica he makes of Etienne’s house. In December 1940, Daniel is summoned back to Paris, and on the journey there, he is arrested. He is taken to a prison camp in Germany, where he eventually dies.
Madame Manec has organized many of the French townspeople into engaging in acts of resistance against their German occupiers. Although Etienne is initially hesitant, he and Marie-Laure eventually begin to take part. Etienne has a special contribution to make: hidden in a secret attic floor of his house is a powerful radio transmitter. Before the war, Etienne used it to broadcast recordings of his deceased brother presenting science programming for children as a way of keeping his memory alive. Now, he uses the radio transmitter to broadcast codes and messages as a way of thwarting the German war effort. This action allows him and Marie-Laure to remain hopeful, even after Madame Manec dies in 1942.
Meanwhile, a boy named Werner Pfennig grows up in an orphanage in Germany with his sister, Jutta. Werner is extremely gifted with mathematical, technological, and scientific knowledge. After he and Jutta find an abandoned radio by accident, Werner teaches himself to repair and rebuild electronics. He is also able to listen to a mysterious French program where a man explains scientific concepts in simple language.  As the Nazi party comes to power in Germany, Werner’s talents attract local attention, and when he is fourteen, he is accepted into a specialized training school. He hopes this opportunity will give him a brighter future, but Jutta fears that her brother will be corrupted by Nazi ideology. Indeed, once Werner is at school, he witnesses a lot of cruelty and brutality, including his close friend being beaten until he suffers severe brain damage.
When Werner is sixteen, his age is falsified so that he can serve on the German front lines. He spends the next two years travelling around, tracking down any civilians who use illegal radios in occupied German territory. Werner works alongside a fellow German soldier named Volkheimer. Although Werner tries to ignore the moral conflict he experiences, he is particularly horrified when one of his fellow soldiers kills a woman and young child. By spring 1944, he and his colleagues are sent to Saint-Malo, where he is astonished to discover that a man with the same voice as the one from the program he listened to as a child is broadcasting secret codes. Unsure what to do, Werner keeps this information secret but also spies on the house from which the signal is broadcasted and catches sight of Marie-Laure.
During this same time period, a Nazi official named von Rumpel has been ordered to seize and catalogue jewels from occupied German territories. He becomes obsessed with finding the legendary Sea of Flames, especially because he is suffering from cancer and believes that the diamond will grant him immortality. Between 1940 and 1944, he gradually tracks down three out of four stones, but the genuine one continues to elude him. He finally traces the stone to Daniel Leblanc’s last known residence: Saint-Malo. In August 1944, Allied forces begin bombing Saint-Malo. All three characters are affected by the bombing: Werner becomes trapped in a cellar when a building collapses on him, Marie-Laure is alone in her house, unsure what to do, and von Rumpel seizes the opportunity to go to the house to search for the diamond. When she hears a stranger enter the house, Marie-Laure hides in the attic with Etienne’s radio transmitter, taking the diamond with her. Over the course of four days, she stays hidden, broadcasting messages that Werner receives while trapped in the cellar.
Werner eventually escapes from the cellar and rushes to the house. Von Rumpel believes that Werner is also looking for the diamond, and when he threatens the young soldier, Werner shoots and kills him. Marie-Laure is then finally able to come out of hiding and Werner helps her to get to safety. As they flee the town, Marie-Laure leaves the diamond in a hidden grotto and gives the key to the grotto to Werner. They part ways, and Marie-Laure reunites with Etienne and goes to live with him in Paris. Werner is imprisoned and falls ill. A few months later, while he is delirious, he accidentally steps on a landmine and dies. Years later, in 1974, some of Werner’s possessions are sent to Volkheimer, and Volkheimer takes them to Jutta. Jutta follows these clues to eventually meet Marie-Laure, who has gone on to become a scientist and have a child. Although Marie-Laure wonders if Werner might have gone back to pick up the diamond, it seems most likely that the gemstone was left in the grotto to be washed into the sea."
Heaven,"Pigs In Heaven opens in rural Kentucky, where Alice Greer has woken up in the middle of the night, feeling lonely. She walks outside in her nightgown, imagining herself the queen of her own humble garden. Her husband Harland and his fetish with their T.V. provides her little warmth. She thinks about her cousin, Sugar, her girlhood companion. Although now Sugar lives out in Oklahoma, on the Cherokee Nation, the thought of her makes Alice feel less alone.
Meanwhile, Alice's daughter Taylor and Taylor's adopted daughter Turtle are visiting the Hoover Dam, one of their stopping points on their tour of the Grand Canyon. When Turtle sees a man—Lucky Buster—fall off the edge of the dam, Taylor and Turtle hound down a rescue team, and are immediately catapulted into the media spotlight. After driving Lucky Buster home, they return home to Tucson, only to prepare for a trip to Chicago to appear on Oprah.
When Taylor and Turtle return home again, it seems as if their lives have almost returned to normal. They live with Jax, Taylor's boyfriend, on the outskirts of Tucson, in a community of humble stone dwellings inhabited mostly by artists and a few academics. Jax adores Taylor, but Taylor is not as sure about him. Before Taylor and Turtle can settle in again, however, Annawake Fourkiller, a lawyer from the Cherokee Nation, shows up at their home to confront Taylor about Turtle's adoption. Annawake saw Turtle on Oprah, and recognized her as a Cherokee girl. On the show, Taylor explained the peculiar circumstances of the adoption: a woman in a bar in Oklahoma handed the baby over to Taylor. The Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 states that no one can adopt a Cherokee child without tribal permission.
Taylor is understandably enraged. She never asked for a child, and when Turtle came to her, she was half-dead, having been sexually abused. Three years later, Turtle is a happy, healthy, secure child, and all of a sudden, Annawake shows up telling Taylor that Turtle cannot belong to her. The next time Annawake comes to their home, Taylor and Turtle have fled.
Turtle and Taylor are staying at Lucky Buster's mother's hotel in Arizona, but when Taylor hears that Annawake is still on the scene, they flee to Las Vegas. At this point in the novel, Turtle begins to have bad memories of her abusive past, which cause her to disengage with the world around her. Any threat of separation, or fear of dislocation, seems to incite these episodes.
Taylor and Turtle arrive in Las Vegas, and immediately gamble away what little money they had. At that point, Alice comes to meet her daughter and granddaughter, to offer support, and to run away for good from her husband. They meet a waitress who has a nutty obsession with Barbie, and feeling sorry for her, give her a ride when they leave Las Vegas. At this point, Taylor has no idea where to go next, but only knows that she is still running from Annawake.
Meanwhile, in a tourist town in Wyoming, Cash Stillwater cannot seem to move beyond his tragic past. He has come to live there from the Cherokee Nation, having lost his mother, wife, and one of his daughters all in the same year. The daughter who died by suicide had a child, who a second daughter gave away one night at a bar in Oklahoma. Cash works in a health food store and makes beaded jewelry by night, but feels empty. When the owner of the jewelry store commits suicide, Cash decides he has to return home to the Cherokee Nation.
At home in Tucson, Jax receives a letter from Annawake the same night he begins an affair with his landlord, Gundi. The letter is one way that we come to sympathize with Annawake's position. She lost her twin brother, Gabe to a white family in Texas when they were only ten. The Cherokee tribe has suffered an inordinate amount at the hands of white Americans throughout history; now, white America is still taking children from the Nation. Also, Annawake explains that this pursuance is also for Turtle's benefit. Native American children who grow up outside the nation without a sense of their heritage, usually suffer greatly.
When Jax reads the letter to Taylor over the phone, she becomes more desperate, but Alice understands that at some point, they will have to talk to Annawake about this problem. Alice calls up her cousin Sugar and makes plans to go to the Cherokee Nation to talk over Turtle's case. Taylor, Turtle, and Barbie go on to Seattle, where they find a room to rent. Taylor has discovered that Barbie has stolen money from the Las Vegas casino, but condones her behavior. Taylor finds low-wage work in Seattle, and Barbie baby-sits for Turtle, until one night they find that Barbie has fled with all of Taylor's money. Feeling desperate, Taylor calls Jax, forgiving him for his affair, and finally figures she will go home. Unfortunately, Alice tells her on the phone from Oklahoma that Taylor has to come out to the Nation; Annawake is going to send her a subpoena.
Meanwhile, on the Nation, Cash Stillwater has returned, and he and Alice have started to date. Alice goes with him to a stomp dance, and finally feels completely part of a community. Alice has also met with Annawake, of course, who reports that there is a relative on the Nation missing a little girl, who might be Turtle. Alice and Cash figure out that they are both in the midst of trying to protect the same grandchild—Turtle. Annawake has actually orchestrated their romantic involvement, hoping some answer would come out of it.
When Taylor arrives, Turtle recognizes Cash right away, and he breaks down in cries of happiness. Both sides still do not want to give up Turtle. In a meeting with members of the Cherokee community, Annawake announces that through talks with the tribe social worker, they have decided to give joint custody to Cash and Taylor. Turtle will spend at least three months of the year on the Nation. Cash then asks Alice to marry him, suggesting that Turtle would be able to visit her grandmother as well as her grandfather during those months. In a symbolic sacrifice to Alice, he destroys his T.V. in front of the whole community."
Manufacturing,"The convict Jean Valjean is released from a French prison after serving nineteen years for stealing a loaf of bread and for subsequent attempts to escape from prison. When Valjean arrives at the town of Digne, no one is willing to give him shelter because he is an ex-convict. Desperate, Valjean knocks on the door of M. Myriel, the kindly bishop of Digne. Myriel treats Valjean with kindness, and Valjean repays the bishop by stealing his silverware. When the police arrest Valjean, Myriel covers for him, claiming that the silverware was a gift. The authorities release Valjean and Myriel makes him promise to become an honest man. Eager to fulfill his promise, Valjean masks his identity and enters the town of Montreuil-sur-mer. Under the assumed name of Madeleine, Valjean invents an ingenious manufacturing process that brings the town prosperity. He eventually becomes the town’s mayor.
Fantine, a young woman from Montreuil, lives in Paris. She falls in love with Tholomyès, a wealthy student who gets her pregnant and then abandons her. Fantine returns to her home village with her daughter, Cosette. On the way to Montreuil, however, Fantine realizes that she will never be able to find work if the townspeople know that she has an illegitimate child. In the town of Montfermeil, she meets the Thénardiers, a family that runs the local inn. The Thénardiers agree to look after Cosette as long as Fantine sends them a monthly allowance.
In Montreuil, Fantine finds work in Madeleine’s factory. Fantine’s coworkers find out about Cosette, however, and Fantine is fired. The Thénardiers demand more money to support Cosette, and Fantine resorts to prostitution to make ends meet. One night, Javert, Montreuil’s police chief, arrests Fantine. She is to be sent to prison, but Madeleine intervenes. Fantine has fallen ill, and when she longs to see Cosette, Madeleine promises to send for her. First, however, he must contend with Javert, who has discovered Madeleine’s criminal past. Javert tells Madeleine that a man has been accused of being Jean Valjean, and Madeleine confesses his true identity. Javert shows up to arrest Valjean while Valjean is at Fantine’s bedside, and Fantine dies from the shock.
After a few years, Valjean escapes from prison and heads to Montfermeil, where he is able to buy Cosette from the Thénardiers. The Thénardiers turn out to be a family of scoundrels who abuse Cosette while spoiling their own two daughters, Eponine and Azelma. Valjean and Cosette move to a run-down part of Paris. Javert discovers their hideout, however, and they are forced to flee. They find refuge in a convent, where Cosette attends school and Valjean works as a gardener.
Marius Pontmercy is a young man who lives with his wealthy grandfather, M. Gillenormand. Because of political differences within the family, Marius has never met his father, Georges Pontmercy. After his father dies, however, Marius learns more about him and comes to admire his father’s democratic politics. Angry with his grandfather, Marius moves out of Gillenormand’s house and lives as a poor young law student. While in law school, Marius associates with a group of radical students, the Friends of the ABC, who are led by the charismatic Enjolras. One day, Marius sees Cosette at a public park. It is love at first sight, but the protective Valjean does his utmost to prevent Cosette and Marius from ever meeting. Their paths cross once again, however, when Valjean makes a charitable visit to Marius’s poor neighbors, the Jondrettes. The Jondrettes are in fact the Thénardiers, who have lost their inn and moved to Paris under an assumed name. After Valjean leaves, Thénardier announces a plan to rob Valjean when he returns. Alarmed, Marius alerts the local police inspector, who turns out to be Javert. The ambush is foiled and the Thénardiers are arrested, but Valjean escapes before Javert can identify him.
Thénardier’s daughter Eponine, who is in love with Marius, helps Marius discover Cosette’s whereabouts. Marius is finally able to make contact with Cosette, and the two declare their love for each other. Valjean, however, soon shatters their happiness. Worried that he will lose Cosette and unnerved by political unrest in the city, Valjean announces that he and Cosette are moving to England. In desperation, Marius runs to his grandfather, M. Gillenormand, to ask for M. Gillenormand’s permission to marry Cosette. Their meeting ends in a bitter argument. When Marius returns to Cosette, she and Valjean have disappeared. Heartbroken, Marius decides to join his radical student friends, who have started a political uprising. Armed with two pistols, Marius heads for the barricades.
The uprising seems doomed, but Marius and his fellow students nonetheless stand their ground and vow to fight for freedom and democracy. The students discover Javert among their ranks, and, realizing that he is a spy, Enjolras ties him up. As the army launches its first attack against the students, Eponine throws herself in front of a rifle to save Marius’s life. As Eponine dies in Marius’s arms, she hands him a letter from Cosette. Marius quickly scribbles a reply and orders a boy, Gavroche, to deliver it to Cosette.
Valjean manages to intercept the note and sets out to save the life of the man his daughter loves. Valjean arrives at the barricade and volunteers to execute Javert. When alone with Javert, however, Valjean instead secretly lets him go free. As the army storms the barricade, Valjean grabs the wounded Marius and flees through the sewers. When Valjean emerges hours later, Javert immediately arrests him. Valjean pleads with Javert to let him take the dying Marius to Marius’s grandfather. Javert agrees. Javert feels tormented, torn between his duty to his profession and the debt he owes Valjean for saving his life. Ultimately, Javert lets Valjean go and throws himself into the river, where he drowns.
Marius makes a full recovery and is reconciled with Gillenormand, who consents to Marius and Cosette’s marriage. Their wedding is a happy one, marred only when Valjean confesses his criminal past to Marius. Alarmed by this revelation and unaware that it was Valjean who saved his life at the barricades, Marius tries to prevent Cosette from having contact with Valjean. Lonely and depressed, Valjean takes to his bed and awaits his death. Marius eventually finds out from Thénardier that Valjean saved Marius’s life. Ashamed that he mistrusted Valjean, Marius tells Cosette everything that has happened. Marius and Cosette rush to Valjean’s side just in time for a final reconciliation. Happy to be reunited with his adopted daughter, Valjean dies in peace."
Remains,"The Remains of the Day is told in the first-person narration of an English butler named Stevens. In July 1956, Stevens decides to take a six- day road trip to the West Country of England—a region to the west of Darlington Hall, the house in which Stevens resides and has worked as a butler for thirty-four years. Though the house was previously owned by the now-deceased Lord Darlington, by 1956, it has come under the ownership of Mr. Farraday, an American gentleman. Stevens likes Mr. Farraday, but fails to interact well with him socially: Stevens is a circumspect, serious person and is not comfortable joking around in the manner Mr. Farraday prefers. Stevens terms this skill of casual conversation ""bantering""; several times throughout the novel Stevens proclaims his desire to improve his bantering skill so that he can better please his current employer.
The purpose of Stevens's road trip is to visit Miss Kenton, the former housekeeper of Darlington Hall who left twenty years earlier to get married. Stevens has received a letter from Miss Kenton, and believes that her letter hints that her marriage is failing and that she might like to return to her post as housekeeper. Ever since World War II has ended, it has been difficult to find enough people to staff large manor houses such as Darlington Hall.
Much of the narrative is comprised of Stevens's memories of his work as a butler during and just after World War II. He describes the large, elaborate dinner parties and elegant, prominent personages who come to dine and stay at Darlington Hall in those times. It is gradually revealed—largely through other characters' interactions with Stevens, rather than his own admissions—that Lord Darlington, due to his mistaken impression of the German agenda prior to World War II, sympathized with the Nazis. Darlington even arranged and hosted dinner parties between the German and British heads of state to help both sides come to a peaceful understanding. Stevens always maintains that Lord Darlington was a perfect gentleman, and that it is a shame his reputation has been soiled simply because he misunderstood the Nazis' true aims.
During the trip Stevens also recounts stories of his contemporaries—butlers in other houses with whom he struck up friendships. Stevens's most notable relationship by far, however, is his long-term working relationship with Miss Kenton. Though Stevens never says so outright, it appears that he harbors repressed romantic feelings for Miss Kenton. Despite the fact that the two frequently disagree over various household affairs when they work together, the disagreements are childish in nature and mainly serve to illustrate the fact that the two care for each other. At the end of the novel, Miss Kenton admits to Stevens that her life may have turned out better if she had married him. After hearing these words, Stevens is extremely upset. However, he does not tell Miss Kenton—whose married name is Mrs. Benn—how he feels. Stevens and Miss Kenton part, and Stevens returns to Darlington Hall, his only new resolve being to perfect the art of bantering to please his new employer.
As Salman Rushdie comments, The Remains of the Day is ""a story both beautiful and cruel."" It is a story primarily about regret: throughout his life, Stevens puts his absolute trust and devotion in a man who makes drastic mistakes. In the totality of his professional commitment, Stevens fails to pursue the one woman with whom he could have had a fulfilling and loving relationship. His prim mask of formality cuts him off from intimacy, companionship, and understanding."
Always,"Charlie, the fifteen-year-old narrator of The Perks of Being a Wallflower, has just entered his freshman year of high school when the book begins. Charlie is the eponymous “wallflower.” He is quiet and withdrawn, but he is also extremely observant and thoughtful, always paying close attention to everything going on around him, even if he is only a silent witness. Charlie writes the entire book as a series of letters to an anonymous “friend.” The reader never learns who this “friend” is, and the “friend” never writes back. Each letter begins with the greeting “Dear friend” and ends “Love always, Charlie.” Because the recipient of the letters never writes back, the novel reads like a series of diary entries.
When the novel opens, Charlie is grappling with two major traumatic deaths of loved ones in his past. The most recent death occurred last spring, when his only friend from middle school committed suicide. When Charlie was seven, his beloved Aunt Helen was killed in a car crash on Christmas Eve, which is also Charlie’s birthday. Although Charlie is nervous about entering high school, he soon finds acceptance from two main sources. First, his English teacher, Bill Anderson, recognizes Charlie’s talent for literature, and he takes him under his wing, assigning him extra books to read and essays to write over the course of the year. Also, Charlie begins to participate more in events, and he becomes friends with Patrick and his stepsister, Sam, who integrate him into their friend group. Charlie develops an enormous crush on Sam, which he tells her about, but Sam treats him affectionately. Patrick, who is gay, is having a closeted relationship with Brad, the quarterback of the football team. Sam kisses Charlie so that his first kiss can be from someone who loves him.
As the school year progresses, Charlie begins to come out of his shell somewhat, but Charlie’s life, his family life, and his friends’ lives become more and more complicated. The holidays are always a difficult time for Charlie’s family, because they bring up memories of Aunt Helen’s death. This year is no exception. Even though Charlie finds some solace in reading and re-reading The Catcher in the Rye, he still struggles to cope with his depression and with flashbacks of his time with Aunt Helen. However, Charlie’s acceptance by his friend group helps him become more at peace with himself. As Charlie becomes more mature, his relationship with his sister also deepens. Charlie’s sister has an abusive boyfriend. Charlie tells Bill about the boyfriend, and Bill reports it to their parents, which makes his sister mad at Charlie. But when Charlie’s sister becomes pregnant, she decides to have an abortion, she trusts Charlie to drive her to the clinic.
After Charlie performs as Rocky in one of his friend group’s regular viewings of the film The Rocky Horror Picture Show, Mary Elizabeth, a smart, pretty senior in their friend group, starts dating Charlie. However, Mary Elizabeth is far more interested in Mary Elizabeth than in having a relationship. During a game of Truth or Dare, Charlie is dared to kiss the prettiest girl in the room, and he kisses Sam. Mary Elizabeth stalks out of the room in a rage. In solidarity, the rest of the group sides with Mary Elizabeth, and Patrick advises Charlie to stay away from everyone for a while until tempers cool down.
Brad’s abusive father discovers Patrick and Brad’s relationship, and Brad is sent to rehab. When Brad returns, he refuses to speak to Patrick. Patrick confronts Brad in the cafeteria, Brad makes a derogatory comment about Patrick’s homosexuality, and Brad’s football teammates beat up Patrick. Charlie jumps in and, in a whirlwind, breaks up the fight. His defense of Patrick wins back the respect of Sam and his friend group. Patrick is thoroughly depressed and he leans on Charlie for emotional support. Patrick gets drunk and kisses Charlie, but he apologizes, and Charlie understands that Patrick is lonely and doesn’t know how to handle it. Eventually, Patrick sees Brad kissing a strange man in the park, which helps Patrick pull himself together and move on.
At the end of the school year, Charlie becomes increasingly anxious as the prospect of all his senior friends moving away becomes more and more imminent. When Sam is packing to leave for her summer pre-college program, she and Charlie begin to make out and start to have sexual contact, but Charlie suddenly gets extremely uncomfortable. The sexual contact dredges up a repressed memory of his Aunt Helen molesting him as a child.
In an epilogue, Charlie writes a final letter to his “friend,” dated two months later, saying that his parents had found him naked in a catatonic state on the couch. They took him to a mental hospital, where Charlie eventually realizes that Aunt Helen had sexually abused him, but that he had repressed these memories. Charlie forgives the memory of his Aunt Helen, and the novel ends with Charlie writing that he is planning to stop writing letters and to start participating fully in his life."
Excellent,"Pip, a young orphan living with his sister and her husband in the marshes of Kent, sits in a cemetery one evening looking at his parents’ tombstones. Suddenly, an escaped convict springs up from behind a tombstone, grabs Pip, and orders him to bring him food and a file for his leg irons. Pip obeys, but the fearsome convict is soon captured anyway. The convict protects Pip by claiming to have stolen the items himself.
One day Pip is taken by his Uncle Pumblechook to play at Satis House, the home of the wealthy dowager Miss Havisham, who is extremely eccentric: she wears an old wedding dress everywhere she goes and keeps all the clocks in her house stopped at the same time. During his visit, he meets a beautiful young girl named Estella, who treats him coldly and contemptuously. Nevertheless, he falls in love with her and dreams of becoming a wealthy gentleman so that he might be worthy of her. He even hopes that Miss Havisham intends to make him a gentleman and marry him to Estella, but his hopes are dashed when, after months of regular visits to Satis House, Miss Havisham decides to help him become a common laborer in his family’s business.
With Miss Havisham’s guidance, Pip is apprenticed to his brother-in-law, Joe, who is the village blacksmith. Pip works in the forge unhappily, struggling to better his education with the help of the plain, kind Biddy and encountering Joe’s malicious day laborer, Orlick. One night, after an altercation with Orlick, Pip’s sister, known as Mrs. Joe, is viciously attacked and becomes a mute invalid. From her signals, Pip suspects that Orlick was responsible for the attack.
One day a lawyer named Jaggers appears with strange news: a secret benefactor has given Pip a large fortune, and Pip must come to London immediately to begin his education as a gentleman. Pip happily assumes that his previous hopes have come true—that Miss Havisham is his secret benefactor and that the old woman intends for him to marry Estella.
In London, Pip befriends a young gentleman named Herbert Pocket and Jaggers’s law clerk, Wemmick. He expresses disdain for his former friends and loved ones, especially Joe, but he continues to pine after Estella. He furthers his education by studying with the tutor Matthew Pocket, Herbert’s father. Herbert himself helps Pip learn how to act like a gentleman. When Pip turns twenty-one and begins to receive an income from his fortune, he will secretly help Herbert buy his way into the business he has chosen for himself. But for now, Herbert and Pip lead a fairly undisciplined life in London, enjoying themselves and running up debts. Orlick reappears in Pip’s life, employed as Miss Havisham’s porter, but is promptly fired by Jaggers after Pip reveals Orlick’s unsavory past. Mrs. Joe dies, and Pip goes home for the funeral, feeling tremendous grief and remorse. Several years go by, until one night a familiar figure barges into Pip’s room—the convict, Magwitch, who stuns Pip by announcing that he, not Miss Havisham, is the source of Pip’s fortune. He tells Pip that he was so moved by Pip’s boyhood kindness that he dedicated his life to making Pip a gentleman, and he made a fortune in Australia for that very purpose.
Pip is appalled, but he feels morally bound to help Magwitch escape London, as the convict is pursued both by the police and by Compeyson, his former partner in crime. A complicated mystery begins to fall into place when Pip discovers that Compeyson was the man who abandoned Miss Havisham at the altar and that Estella is Magwitch’s daughter. Miss Havisham has raised her to break men’s hearts, as revenge for the pain her own broken heart caused her. Pip was merely a boy for the young Estella to practice on; Miss Havisham delighted in Estella’s ability to toy with his affections.
As the weeks pass, Pip sees the good in Magwitch and begins to care for him deeply. Before Magwitch’s escape attempt, Estella marries an upper-class lout named Bentley Drummle. Pip makes a visit to Satis House, where Miss Havisham begs his forgiveness for the way she has treated him in the past, and he forgives her. Later that day, when she bends over the fireplace, her clothing catches fire and she goes up in flames. She survives but becomes an invalid. In her final days, she will continue to repent for her misdeeds and to plead for Pip’s forgiveness.
The time comes for Pip and his friends to spirit Magwitch away from London. Just before the escape attempt, Pip is called to a shadowy meeting in the marshes, where he encounters the vengeful, evil Orlick. Orlick is on the verge of killing Pip when Herbert arrives with a group of friends and saves Pip’s life. Pip and Herbert hurry back to effect Magwitch’s escape. They try to sneak Magwitch down the river on a rowboat, but they are discovered by the police, who Compeyson tipped off. Magwitch and Compeyson fight in the river, and Compeyson is drowned. Magwitch is sentenced to death, and Pip loses his fortune. Magwitch feels that his sentence is God’s forgiveness and dies at peace. Pip falls ill; Joe comes to London to care for him, and they are reconciled. Joe gives him the news from home: Orlick, after robbing Pumblechook, is now in jail; Miss Havisham has died and left most of her fortune to the Pockets; Biddy has taught Joe how to read and write. After Joe leaves, Pip decides to rush home after him and marry Biddy, but when he arrives there he discovers that she and Joe have already married.
Pip decides to go abroad with Herbert to work in the mercantile trade. Returning many years later, he encounters Estella in the ruined garden at Satis House. Drummle, her husband, treated her badly, but he is now dead. Pip finds that Estella’s coldness and cruelty have been replaced by a sad kindness, and the two leave the garden hand in hand, Pip believing that they will never part again.

Rose,"Seventeen-year-old Maverick Malcolm Carter, known as Mav, plays basketball at Rose Park with his cousin, Dre, his best friend, King, and Shawn, Rico, P-Nut, and Junie. All are members of the gang, or “set,” called the King Lords. Mav lives with his mother, Faye, in Garden Heights. His father, Adonis, one of the original King Lords, has been in prison since Mav was seven. There are several levels in the King Lords. Mav and King are “li’l homies,” members who sell only weed and help with initiations. Older members, including Shawn and P-Nut, are known as “big homies” who get to sell harder drugs and fight with their rival gang, the Garden Disciples.
A year ago, Mav had a one-night stand with King’s sometimes-girlfriend, Iesha, who later gave birth to a boy she named King Jr. After the basketball game, Mav and Faye meet Iesha at a clinic, where they learn that Mav, not King, is the father of the baby. Iesha abandons King Jr. with Mav and disappears. Later, Dre, who has cleaned up his lifestyle to take care of his fiancée and baby, Keisha and Andreanna, tells Mav he must make similar changes now that he’s a father. He makes Mav promise to stop dealing, helps Mav get a part-time job working for Mav’s neighbor, Mr. Wyatt, and drives Mav to his girlfriend Lisa’s house so he can come clean about the baby. Upon hearing the news, Lisa breaks up with Mav.
At school, Ant, a Garden Disciple, warns Mav to tell Dre to watch his back because he’s been racing his car in their territory. Later in the day, Mav and King confront a guy named Red who sold Mav fake Air Jordans, but Red refuses to refund Mav. For the next month, Mav focuses on school, working in Mr. Wyatt’s garden and grocery store, and caring for his son, whom he’s renamed Seven. One night, Dre surprises Mav with a water gun fight and pizza, which they eat in Dre’s car, even sharing a piece with Bus Stop Tony, a local addict, who happens to walk by. While Mav is in the house checking on Seven, gunshots echo in the street. By the time Mav gets back to the car, Dre is dead. At Dre’s funeral, Mav tells Shawn, one of the set’s big homies, that he suspects Ant killed Dre, and Shawn promises to look into it. Lisa and Mav then walk to her house, where they end up having unprotected sex.
One Friday night, Mav, King, Rico, and Junie go to a football game, where Ant is shot and killed in the parking lot. Three weeks after Dre’s funeral, Lisa and Mav find out she’s pregnant, but Lisa refuses to get back together with him as he’s in a gang and she wants someone dependable. The day before Thanksgiving, Faye and Mav visit Adonis in prison so Mav can tell him about Lisa’s pregnancy. Adonis wonders why Mav keeps making “stupid” mistakes, to which Mav replies that it was Adonis’s stupid mistake that landed him in prison. Later, Mav learns that Lisa’s mother threw her out and she’s living with her best friend, Tammy. At Lisa’s first doctor’s appointment, Mav feels humiliated that he can’t afford her $20 co-pay; he makes up his mind to start dealing again and reaches out to King.
While visiting Lisa at Tammy’s, Mav notices that Red, Tammy’s sister’s boyfriend, is wearing Dre’s gold watch, the same watch Dre had on the night he was killed. When Red realizes that Mav recognizes the watch, he abruptly leaves the house. Mav becomes obsessed with Red and keeps making mistakes at work. Mr. Wyatt, understanding the pressures put on Mav by fatherhood and the lure of the set, reminds Mav that he has the power to forge his own path in life. When Mav tells P-Nut, the new head of the King Lords, about Red, P-Nut insults and dismisses him. Mav suddenly understands that the set doesn’t offer him the support and safety it once did.
Soon, Mav flunks out of school. While getting drugs at King’s house, he tells King that he thinks Red killed Dre. King implies that Mav must take care of business himself and later gives him a gun. At home, Mav pretends to go to school every day but instead follows Red to memorize his daily routines. One afternoon, after Mav and Lisa take a tour of Markham State College, which Mav arranged as a surprise for Lisa, they meet Keisha at a restaurant. Knowing Keisha was on the phone with Dre when he was shot, Mav asks her to share what she heard. He learns that Bus Stop Tony returned to the car to ask Dre for money. When Mav questions Bus Stop Tony later, Tony describes the killer’s car, and Mav knows for sure that Red’s guilty. One night, Mav goes to where he knows Red will be. He creeps up on Red from behind and holds the gun to Red’s head. Ultimately, he’s unable to pull the trigger, and he runs straights to Lisa’s, where he tells her everything. As Lisa holds him, he decides to make changes in his life.
Back home, while Mav gathers up his drug stash to return to King, some falls into the toilet. Mav panics, knowing he’ll still owe King the cash for what’s lost. The next morning, he gives King back the gun and what’s left of the drugs. King becomes infuriated that Mav lost him money and warns Mav that he’ll get even one day. King drives away, and Mav lets himself into Mr. Wyatt’s backyard to admire the roses he planted, roses that Mr. Wyatt explained could bloom even under harsh conditions. Mr. Wyatt joins him. When Mav informs him that he’s going to get his GED, Mr. Wyatt offers him a full-time job. Weeks pass, and Mav and Lisa learn they are having a girl. Lisa notices all of the changes Mav’s made in his life to prove to her that she can depend on him. As they sit on Mav’s porch, they think of what they might name their daughter."
Back,"A Wrinkle in Time is the story of Meg Murry, a high-school-aged girl who is transported on an adventure through time and space with her younger brother Charles Wallace and her friend Calvin O'Keefe to rescue her father, a gifted scientist, from the evil forces that hold him prisoner on another planet. At the beginning of the book, Meg is a homely, awkward, but loving girl, troubled by personal insecurities and her concern for her father, who has been missing for over a year. The plot begins with the arrival of Mrs. Whatsit at the Murry house on a dark and stormy evening. Although she looks like an eccentric tramp, she is actually a celestial creature with the ability to read Meg's thoughts. She startles Meg's mother by reassuring her of the existence of a tesseract--a sort of ""wrinkle"" in space and time. It is through this wrinkle that Meg and her companions will travel through the fifth dimension in search of Mr. Murry.
On the afternoon following Mrs. Whatsit's visit, Meg and Charles Wallace walk over to Mrs. Whatsit's cabin. On the way, they meet Calvin O'Keefe, a popular boy in Meg's school whom Charles considers a kindred spirit. The three children learn from Mrs. Whatsit and her friends Mrs. Who and Mrs. Which that the universe is threatened by a great evil called the Dark Thing and taking the form of a giant cloud, engulfing the stars around it. Several planets have already succumbed to this evil force, including Camazotz, the planet on which Mr. Murry is imprisoned.
The three Mrs. W's transport the children to Camazotz and instruct them to remain always in each other's company while on their quest for Mr. Murry. On Camazotz, all objects and places appear exactly alike because the whole planet must conform to the terrifying rhythmic pulsation of IT, a giant disembodied brain. Charles Wallace tries to fight IT with his exceptional intelligence but is overpowered by the evil and becomes a robot-like creature mouthing the words with which IT infuses him. Under the control of IT, Charles leads Meg and Calvin to Mr. Murry and together they confront IT. However, they, too, are unable to withstand IT's power; they escape only at the last minute, when Mr. Murry appears and seizes Meg and Calvin, ""tessering"" away with them (traveling via another tesseract) to a gray planet called Ixchel inhabited by tall, furry beasts who care for the travelers. Charles Wallace remains possessed by IT, a prisoner of Camazotz.
On Planet Ixchel the three Mrs. W's appear once again, and Meg realizes that she must travel alone back to Camazotz to rescue her brother. Mrs. Which tells her that she has one thing that IT does not have, and this will be her weapon against the evil. However, Meg must discover this weapon for herself. When standing in the presence of IT, Meg realizes what this is: her ability to love. Thus, by concentrating on her love for Charles Wallace, she is able to restore him to his true identity. Meg releases Charles from IT's clutches and tessers with him through time and space, landing in her twin brothers' vegetable garden on Earth, where her father and Calvin stand waiting. The family joyously reunites, and the Mrs. W's visit the happy scene en route to further travels."
Innocence,"Newland Archer couldn't be more pleased with his recent engagement to the beautiful debutante May Welland. However, his world is thrown upside down by the sensational arrival of May's cousin, Countess Ellen Olenska. Recently returned to America after separating from her husband, a philandering Polish count, Countess Olenska shocks the staid New York aristocracy with her revealing clothes, carefree manners, and rumors of adultery. Because the Countess's family, headed by the powerful Mrs. Manson Mingott, have chosen to reintroduce her into good society, Archer and May feel it necessary to befriend her.
As Archer comes to better know the Countess, he begins to appreciate her unconventional views on New York society. Meanwhile, Archer becomes increasingly disillusioned with his new fianceé, May. He begins to see her as the manufactured product of her class: polite, innocent, and utterly devoid of personal opinion and sense of self.
The Countess Olenska soon announces her intention of divorcing her husband. While Archer supports her desire for freedom, he feels compelled to act on behalf of the Mingott family and persuade Ellen to remain married. At a friend's cottage near Hudson, Archer realizes that he is in love with Ellen. He abruptly leaves the next day for Florida, where he is reunited with May and her parents, who are there on vacation. There, he presses May to shorten their engagement. May becomes suspicious and asks him if his hurry to get married is prompted by the fear that he is marrying the wrong person. Archer reassures May that he is in love with her. Back in New York, Archer calls on Ellen, and Archer admits that he is in love with her. Just then, a telegram arrives from May, announcing that her parents have pushed forward the wedding date.
After their wedding and honeymoon in Europe, Archer and May settle down to married life in New York. Over time, Archer's memory of Ellen fades to a wistful image. But on vacation in Newport, he is reunited with her, and Ellen promises not to return to Europe as long as she and Newland do not act upon their love for each other. Back in New York, Archer learns that Count Olenski wants his wife to return to him and that Ellen has refused. After the stroke of her grandmother, Ellen returns to New York to care for her. She and Archer agree to consummate their affair. But suddenly, Ellen announces her intention to return to Europe. May throws a farewell party for Ellen, and after the guests leave, May announces to Archer that she is pregnant and that she told Ellen her news two weeks earlier.
Twenty-five years pass. In that time, the Archers have had three children and May has died from pneumonia. Now Archer's son convinces him to travel to France. There, they arrange to visit the Countess Olenska at her Paris apartment. However, at the last minute Archer sends his son alone to visit her, content instead to live with his memories of the past."
Hours,"The Hours follows three women through one day in their lives. One of the narrative strands explores the day in 1923 when Virginia Woolf begins to write Mrs. Dalloway. Another centers around a day in the life of Laura Brown, an American housewife, in 1949, in which she spends part of her time reading Mrs. 	Dalloway. The third narrative takes place on a day in the late twentieth century, in which Clarissa Vaughn hosts a party for her poet-friend Richard. The chapters alternate with rough regularity between these three main characters.
The prologue details the suicide of Virginia Woolf. She leaves notes for her husband and sister, then walks to a nearby river. She selects a large stone from the bank, places it her pocket, and wades into the water.
The next group of chapters retells the early mornings of the three main characters. Clarissa Vaughn leaves her New York apartment to buy flowers. She is hosting a party that evening in honor of her best friend Richard, a poet and novelist dying of AIDS, who is receiving a prestigious literary award for his life’s work. As she walks, she bumps into her old friend Walter Hardy and catches a glimpse of a movie star peeking outside of her trailer. 
The story turns to Virginia Woolf on a morning nearly twenty years before she commits suicide. She wakes up thinking about how to begin her new novel, which will detail a day in the life of a woman named Clarissa Dalloway. Virginia greets her husband as he corrects proofs, and she skips breakfast to avoid dealing with her temperamental cook. After returning to her room, she settles in to write. 
The attention turns to Laura Brown, a mother living in Los Angeles after World War II as she lies in bed reading Mrs. 	Dalloway. She does not have the energy to go downstairs and say “happy birthday” to her husband, Dan, or to make breakfast for her young son, Richie. After reading for an hour or two, she finally goes downstairs. Dan leaves for work and she is alone with her son. 
In what is now late morning, Clarissa Vaughn stands on the street outside the flower shop trying to catch sight of the movie star who came out of the trailer. She gives up and continues walking, passing the corner where she and Richard broke up many years ago. She visits Richard in his messy apartment, brightening the kitchen with fresh flowers as she asks about his health. They must go uptown that night to collect his prize and then go to the party, but despite Clarissa’s reassurances, Richard protests that he does not deserve the prize. 
Virginia Woolf feels the first strains of a crippling headache and sets down her pen after writing for two hours. Because of her health, Leonard has moved her from London to the suburbs, even though she desperately wants to return to the city. Virginia finds Leonard in the printing room chastising his assistant, and she smoothes over the argument. Laura Brown bakes a birthday cake with her son’s help, deciding that the cake must be a perfect work of art.
Before lunch, Virginia takes a walk and thinks about her character Clarissa Dalloway. She decides that Clarissa will have once been in love with a woman and that she will kill herself. Upon returning to the house, she speaks to her cook, who has become angry with Virginia for not organizing lunch. The situation worsens when the cook finds out that Virginia’s sister Vanessa will be bringing her family for tea that afternoon, and the cook must commute to London to pick up special ingredients. 
Clarissa Vaughn bumps into her live-in lover Sally on the way back to their apartment. Sally plans to have lunch with a movie-star friend of hers. As Clarissa puts flowers into water, she thinks about her disappointment over not getting an invitation to this lunch. She feels alienated from her own house and her life, and reminisces about the happy summer she spent with Richard in Wellfleet when they were still romantically involved. Clarissa thinks that summer may have been the only perfect time in her life. Laura Brown finishes the cake and feels disappointed that it does not attain the standard of perfection she had hoped for. Her neighbor Kitty stops by to tell Laura that she must enter the hospital for tests on her uterus. The two women embrace and kiss momentarily, an experience that moves Laura. 
After lunch, Vanessa Bell surprises her sister Virginia by arriving early for tea. Vanessa’s three children find a dying bird in the garden and make a grass bed for the bird with Virginia’s help. Clarissa Vaughn receives a visit from her old friend Louis at her apartment. A former lover of Richard’s who lived with them at Wellfleet, Louis now teaches in San Francisco and has begun an affair with a young student. As they talk, Clarissa’s rebellious daughter Julia shows up at the apartment, and Louis leaves. Laura Brown has thrown away the first cake and baked another. Bored, she feels the need to escape and leaves Richie at a neighbor’s house. She checks into a hotel to read Mrs. Dalloway for two hours, thinking about the concept of suicide and deciding that she could never kill herself. 
In the mid-afternoon, Vanessa and Virginia sit in the kitchen drinking tea. Virginia feels happy and decides that Clarissa Dalloway will not commit suicide after all. Nelly storms in from London, and when she turns her back, Virginia leans in and kisses her sister on the lips. Meanwhile, Clarissa chats with her daughter, Julia, who has brought her difficult friend Mary Krull to the apartment. Clarissa clashes with Mary, who finally leaves to go shopping with Julia. 
Virginia Woolf feels depressed after her sister leaves and attempts to write but decides to take a walk to clear her head. After passing the dead bird in the garden, she wanders to the train station, where she contemplates taking a train to London. As she waits, Leonard shows up and brings her back to the house. The story turns to Clarissa’s lover, Sally, as she eats lunch with Walter Hardy and Oliver St. Ives, the movie star. After lunch, Sally shops with Walter as he buys a gift for his lover, which prompts Sally to stop and buy roses for Clarissa on the way home. 
Before dinner, Laura drives back to the babysitter’s house to pick up her son. Clarissa Vaughn goes over to Richard’s apartment to pick him up for the party to find him sitting on the windowsill. He tells her he loves her and jumps out of the window to his death. Laura Brown watches her husband and her son eat the cake that she has made and thinks about her dissatisfaction with her picture-perfect life. 
The last group of chapters follows the women as they prepare for bed. Virginia Woolf has convinced Leonard to move back to London. She thinks of the kiss she shared with Vanessa and decides that Clarissa Dalloway will have shared a similar kiss with a lover when she was young. After some thought, she decides that Clarissa will not commit suicide, but that someone insane and sensitive will do so instead. Laura Brown gazes into the mirror as she brushes her teeth. Detached from her body, she thinks about the fact that Dan will want to have sex with her. In the final chapter, an older Laura comes to stay at Clarissa’s apartment in the wake of her son Richard’s death. After they speak, Clarissa reflects on the meaning of the passage of time."
Forbearance,"General Prologue
At the Tabard Inn, a tavern in Southwark, near London, the narrator joins a company of twenty-nine pilgrims. The pilgrims, like the narrator, are traveling to the shrine of the martyr Saint Thomas Becket in Canterbury. The narrator gives a descriptive account of twenty-seven of these pilgrims, including a Knight, Squire, Yeoman, Prioress, Monk, Friar, Merchant, Clerk, Man of Law, Franklin, Haberdasher, Carpenter, Weaver, Dyer, Tapestry-Weaver, Cook, Shipman, Physician, Wife, Parson, Plowman, Miller, Manciple, Reeve, Summoner, Pardoner, and Host. (He does not describe the Second Nun or the Nun’s Priest, although both characters appear later in the book.)
The Host, whose name, we find out in the Prologue to the Cook’s Tale, is Harry Bailey, suggests that the group ride together and entertain one another with stories. He decides that each pilgrim will tell two stories on the way to Canterbury and two on the way back. Whomever he judges to be the best storyteller will receive a meal at Bailey’s tavern, courtesy of the other pilgrims. The pilgrims draw lots and determine that the Knight will tell the first tale.
The Knight’s Tale
Theseus, duke of Athens, imprisons Arcite and Palamon, two knights from Thebes (another city in ancient Greece). From their prison, the knights see and fall in love with Theseus’s sister-in-law, Emelye. Through the intervention of a friend, Arcite is freed, but he is banished from Athens. He returns in disguise and becomes a page in Emelye’s chamber. Palamon escapes from prison, and the two meet and fight over Emelye. Theseus apprehends them and arranges a tournament between the two knights and their allies, with Emelye as the prize. Arcite wins, but he is accidentally thrown from his horse and dies. Palamon then marries Emelye.
The Miller’s Prologue and Tale
The Host asks the Monk to tell the next tale, but the drunken Miller interrupts and insists that his tale should be the next. He tells the story of an impoverished student named Nicholas, who persuades his landlord’s sexy young wife, Alisoun, to spend the night with him. He convinces his landlord, a carpenter named John, that the second flood is coming, and tricks him into spending the night in a tub hanging from the ceiling of his barn. Absolon, a young parish clerk who is also in love with Alisoun, appears outside the window of the room where Nicholas and Alisoun lie together.
When Absolon begs Alisoun for a kiss, she sticks her rear end out the window in the dark and lets him kiss it. Absolon runs and gets a red-hot poker, returns to the window, and asks for another kiss; when Nicholas sticks his bottom out the window and farts, Absolon brands him on the buttocks. Nicholas’s cries for water make the carpenter think that the flood has come, so the carpenter cuts the rope connecting his tub to the ceiling, falls down, and breaks his arm.
The Reeve’s Prologue and Tale
Because he also does carpentry, the Reeve takes offense at the Miller’s tale of a stupid carpenter, and counters with his own tale of a dishonest miller. The Reeve tells the story of two students, John and Alayn, who go to the mill to watch the miller grind their corn, so that he won’t have a chance to steal any. But the miller unties their horse, and while they chase it, he steals some of the flour he has just ground for them. By the time the students catch the horse, it is dark, so they spend the night in the miller’s house. That night, Alayn seduces the miller’s daughter, and John seduces his wife. When the miller wakes up and finds out what has happened, he tries to beat the students. His wife, thinking that her husband is actually one of the students, hits the miller over the head with a staff. The students take back their stolen goods and leave.
The Cook’s Prologue and Tale
The Cook particularly enjoys the Reeve’s Tale, and offers to tell another funny tale. The tale concerns an apprentice named Perkyn who drinks and dances so much that he is called “Perkyn Reveler.” Finally, Perkyn’s master decides that he would rather his apprentice leave to revel than stay home and corrupt the other servants. Perkyn arranges to stay with a friend who loves drinking and gambling, and who has a wife who is a prostitute. The tale breaks off, unfinished, after fifty-eight lines.
The Man of Law’s Introduction, Prologue, Tale, and Epilogue
The Host reminds his fellow pilgrims to waste no time, because lost time cannot be regained. He asks the Man of Law to tell the next tale. The Man of Law agrees, apologizing that he cannot tell any suitable tale that Chaucer has not already told—Chaucer may be unskilled as a poet, says the Man of Law, but he has told more stories of lovers than Ovid, and he doesn’t print tales of incest as John Gower does (Gower was a contemporary of Chaucer). In the Prologue to his tale, the Man of Law laments the miseries of poverty. He then remarks how fortunate merchants are, and says that his tale is one told to him by a merchant.
In the tale, the Muslim sultan of Syria converts his entire sultanate (including himself) to Christianity in order to persuade the emperor of Rome to give him his daughter, Custance, in marriage. The sultan’s mother and her attendants remain secretly faithful to Islam. The mother tells her son she wishes to hold a banquet for him and all the Christians. At the banquet, she massacres her son and all the Christians except for Custance, whom she sets adrift in a rudderless ship. After years of floating, Custance runs ashore in Northumberland, where a constable and his wife, Hermengyld, offer her shelter. She converts them to Christianity.
One night, Satan makes a young knight sneak into Hermengyld’s chamber and murder Hermengyld. He places the bloody knife next to Custance, who sleeps in the same chamber. When the constable returns home, accompanied by Alla, the king of Northumberland, he finds his slain wife. He tells Alla the story of how Custance was found, and Alla begins to pity the girl. He decides to look more deeply into the murder. Just as the knight who murdered Hermengyld is swearing that Custance is the true murderer, he is struck down and his eyes burst out of his face, proving his guilt to Alla and the crowd. The knight is executed, Alla and many others convert to Christianity, and Custance and Alla marry.
While Alla is away in Scotland, Custance gives birth to a boy named Mauricius. Alla’s mother, Donegild, intercepts a letter from Custance to Alla and substitutes a counterfeit one that claims that the child is disfigured and bewitched. She then intercepts Alla’s reply, which claims that the child should be kept and loved no matter how malformed. Donegild substitutes a letter saying that Custance and her son are banished and should be sent away on the same ship on which Custance arrived. Alla returns home, finds out what has happened, and kills Donegild.
After many adventures at sea, including an attempted rape, Custance ends up back in Rome, where she reunites with Alla, who has made a pilgrimage there to atone for killing his mother. She also reunites with her father, the emperor. Alla and Custance return to England, but Alla dies after a year, so Custance returns, once more, to Rome. Mauricius becomes the next Roman emperor.
Following the Man of Law’s Tale, the Host asks the Parson to tell the next tale, but the Parson reproaches him for swearing, and they fall to bickering.
The Wife of Bath’s Prologue and Tale
The Wife of Bath gives a lengthy account of her feelings about marriage. Quoting from the Bible, the Wife argues against those who believe it is wrong to marry more than once, and she explains how she dominated and controlled each of her five husbands. She married her fifth husband, Jankyn, for love instead of money. After the Wife has rambled on for a while, the Friar butts in to complain that she is taking too long, and the Summoner retorts that friars are like flies, always meddling. The Friar promises to tell a tale about a summoner, and the Summoner promises to tell a tale about a friar. The Host cries for everyone to quiet down and allow the Wife to commence her tale.
In her tale, a young knight of King Arthur’s court rapes a maiden; to atone for his crime, Arthur’s queen sends him on a quest to discover what women want most. An ugly old woman promises the knight that she will tell him the secret if he promises to do whatever she wants for saving his life. He agrees, and she tells him women want control of their husbands and their own lives. They go together to Arthur’s queen, and the old woman’s answer turns out to be correct. The old woman then tells the knight that he must marry her. When the knight confesses later that he is repulsed by her appearance, she gives him a choice: she can either be ugly and faithful, or beautiful and unfaithful. The knight tells her to make the choice herself, and she rewards him for giving her control of the marriage by rendering herself both beautiful and faithful.
The Friar’s Prologue and Tale
The Friar speaks approvingly of the Wife of Bath’s Tale, and offers to lighten things up for the company by telling a funny story about a lecherous summoner. The Summoner does not object, but he promises to pay the Friar back in his own tale. The Friar tells of an archdeacon who carries out the law without mercy, especially to lechers. The archdeacon has a summoner who has a network of spies working for him, to let him know who has been lecherous.
The summoner extorts money from those he’s sent to summon, charging them more money than he should for penance. He tries to serve a summons on a yeoman who is actually a devil in disguise. After comparing notes on their treachery and extortion, the devil vanishes, but when the summoner tries to prosecute an old wealthy widow unfairly, the widow cries out that the summoner should be taken to hell. The devil follows the woman’s instructions and drags the summoner off to hell.
The Summoner’s Prologue and Tale
The Summoner, furious at the Friar’s Tale, asks the company to let him tell the next tale. First, he tells the company that there is little difference between friars and fiends, and that when an angel took a friar down to hell to show him the torments there, the friar asked why there were no friars in hell; the angel then pulled up Satan’s tail and 20,000 friars came out of his ass.
In the Summoner’s Tale, a friar begs for money from a dying man named Thomas and his wife, who have recently lost their child. The friar shamelessly exploits the couple’s misfortunes to extract money from them, so Thomas tells the friar that he is sitting on something that he will bequeath to the friars. The friar reaches for his bequest, and Thomas lets out an enormous fart. The friar complains to the lord of the manor, whose squire promises to divide the fart evenly among all the friars.
The Clerk’s Prologue and Tale
The Host asks the Clerk to cheer up and tell a merry tale, and the Clerk agrees to tell a tale by the Italian poet Petrarch. Griselde is a hardworking peasant who marries into the aristocracy. Her husband tests her fortitude in several ways, including pretending to kill her children and divorcing her. He punishes her one final time by forcing her to prepare for his wedding to a new wife. She does all this dutifully, her husband tells her that she has always been and will always be his wife (the divorce was a fraud), and they live happily ever after.
The Merchant’s Prologue, Tale, and Epilogue
The Merchant reflects on the great difference between the patient Griselde of the Clerk’s Tale and the horrible shrew he has been married to for the past two months. The Host asks him to tell a story of the evils of marriage, and he complies. Against the advice of his friends, an old knight named January marries May, a beautiful young woman. She is less than impressed by his enthusiastic sexual efforts, and conspires to cheat on him with his squire, Damien. When blind January takes May into his garden to copulate with her, she tells him she wants to eat a pear, and he helps her up into the pear tree, where she has sex with Damien. Pluto, the king of the faeries, restores January’s sight, but May, caught in the act, assures him that he must still be blind. The Host prays to God to keep him from marrying a wife like the one the Merchant describes.
The Squire’s Introduction and Tale
The Host calls upon the Squire to say something about his favorite subject, love, and the Squire willingly complies. King Cambyuskan of the Mongol Empire is visited on his birthday by a knight bearing gifts from the king of Arabia and India. He gives Cambyuskan and his daughter Canacee a magic brass horse, a magic mirror, a magic ring that gives Canacee the ability to understand the language of birds, and a sword with the power to cure any wound it creates. She rescues a dying female falcon that narrates how her consort abandoned her for the love of another. The Squire’s Tale is either unfinished by Chaucer or is meant to be interrupted by the Franklin, who interjects that he wishes his own son were as eloquent as the Squire. The Host expresses annoyance at the Franklin’s interruption, and orders him to begin the next tale.
The Franklin’s Prologue and Tale
The Franklin says that his tale is a familiar Breton lay, a folk ballad of ancient Brittany. Dorigen, the heroine, awaits the return of her husband, Arveragus, who has gone to England to win honor in feats of arms. She worries that the ship bringing her husband home will wreck itself on the coastal rocks, and she promises Aurelius, a young man who falls in love with her, that she will give her body to him if he clears the rocks from the coast. Aurelius hires a student learned in magic to create the illusion that the rocks have disappeared. Arveragus returns home and tells his wife that she must keep her promise to Aurelius. Aurelius is so impressed by Arveragus’s honorable act that he generously absolves her of the promise, and the magician, in turn, generously absolves Aurelius of the money he owes.
The Physician’s Tale
Appius the judge lusts after Virginia, the beautiful daughter of Virginius. Appius persuades a churl named Claudius to declare her his slave, stolen from him by Virginius. Appius declares that Virginius must hand over his daughter to Claudius. Virginius tells his daughter that she must die rather than suffer dishonor, and she virtuously consents to her father’s cutting her head off. Appius sentences Virginius to death, but the Roman people, aware of Appius’s hijinks, throw him into prison, where he kills himself.
The Pardoner’s Introduction, Prologue, and Tale
The Host is dismayed by the tragic injustice of the Physician’s Tale, and asks the Pardoner to tell something merry. The other pilgrims contradict the Host, demanding a moral tale, which the Pardoner agrees to tell after he eats and drinks. The Pardoner tells the company how he cheats people out of their money by preaching that money is the root of all evil. His tale describes three riotous youths who go looking for Death, thinking that they can kill him. An old man tells them that they will find Death under a tree. Instead, they find eight bushels of gold, which they plot to sneak into town under cover of darkness.
The youngest goes into town to fetch food and drink, but brings back poison, hoping to have the gold all to himself. His companions kill him to enrich their own shares, then drink the poison and die under the tree. His tale complete, the Pardoner offers to sell the pilgrims pardons, and singles out the Host to come kiss his relics. The Host infuriates the Pardoner by accusing him of fraud, but the Knight persuades the two to kiss and bury their differences.
The Shipman’s Tale
The Shipman’s Tale features a monk who tricks a merchant’s wife into having sex with him by borrowing money from the merchant, then giving it to the wife so she can repay her own debt to her husband, in exchange for sexual favors. When the monk sees the merchant next, he tells him that he returned the merchant’s money to his wife. The wife realizes she has been duped, but she boldly tells her husband to forgive her debt: she will repay it in bed. The Host praises the Shipman’s story, and asks the Prioress for a tale.
The Prioress’s Prologue and Tale
The Prioress calls on the Virgin Mary to guide her tale. In an Asian city, a Christian school is located at the edge of a Jewish ghetto. An angelic seven-year-old boy, a widow’s son, attends the school. He is a devout Christian, and loves to sing Alma Redemptoris (Gracious Mother of the Redeemer). Singing the song on his way through the ghetto, some Jews hire a murderer to slit his throat and throw him into a latrine. The Jews refuse to tell the widow where her son is, but he miraculously begins to sing Alma Redemptoris, so the Christian people recover his body, and the magistrate orders the murdering Jews to be drawn apart by wild horses and then hanged.
The Prologue and Tale of Sir Thopas
The Host, after teasing Chaucer the narrator about his appearance, asks him to tell a tale. Chaucer says that he only knows one tale, then launches into a parody of bad poetry—the Tale of Sir Thopas. Sir Thopas rides about looking for an elf-queen to marry until he is confronted by a giant. The narrator’s doggerel continues in this vein until the Host can bear no more and interrupts him. Chaucer asks him why he can’t tell his tale, since it is the best he knows, and the Host explains that his rhyme isn’t worth a turd. He encourages Chaucer to tell a prose tale.
The Tale of Melibee
Chaucer’s second tale is the long, moral prose story of Melibee. Melibee’s house is raided by his foes, who beat his wife, Prudence, and severely wound his daughter, Sophie, in her feet, hands, ears, nose, and mouth. Prudence advises him not to rashly pursue vengeance on his enemies, and he follows her advice, putting his foes’ punishment in her hands. She forgives them for the outrages done to her, in a model of Christian forbearance and forgiveness.
The Monk’s Prologue and Tale
The Host wishes that his own wife were as patient as Melibee’s, and calls upon the Monk to tell the next tale. First he teases the Monk, pointing out that the Monk is clearly no poor cloisterer. The Monk takes it all in stride and tells a series of tragic falls, in which noble figures are brought low: Lucifer, Adam, Sampson, Hercules, Nebuchadnezzar, Belshazzar, Zenobia, Pedro of Castile, and down through the ages.
The Nun’s Priest’s Prologue, Tale, and Epilogue
After seventeen noble “falls” narrated by the Monk, the Knight interrupts, and the Host calls upon the Nun’s Priest to deliver something more lively. The Nun’s Priest tells of Chanticleer the Rooster, who is carried off by a flattering fox who tricks him into closing his eyes and displaying his crowing abilities. Chanticleer turns the tables on the fox by persuading him to open his mouth and brag to the barnyard about his feat, upon which Chanticleer falls out of the fox’s mouth and escapes. The Host praises the Nun’s Priest’s Tale, adding that if the Nun’s Priest were not in holy orders, he would be as sexually potent as Chanticleer.
The Second Nun’s Prologue and Tale
In her Prologue, the Second Nun explains that she will tell a saint’s life, that of Saint Cecilia, for this saint set an excellent example through her good works and wise teachings. She focuses particularly on the story of Saint Cecilia’s martyrdom. Before Cecilia’s new husband, Valerian, can take her virginity, she sends him on a pilgrimage to Pope Urban, who converts him to Christianity. An angel visits Valerian, who asks that his brother Tiburce be granted the grace of Christian conversion as well. All three—Cecilia, Tiburce, and Valerian—are put to death by the Romans.
The Canon’s Yeoman’s Prologue and Tale
When the Second Nun’s Tale is finished, the company is overtaken by a black-clad Canon and his Yeoman, who have heard of the pilgrims and their tales and wish to participate. The Yeoman brags to the company about how he and the Canon create the illusion that they are alchemists, and the Canon departs in shame at having his secrets discovered. The Yeoman tells a tale of how a canon defrauded a priest by creating the illusion of alchemy using sleight of hand.
The Manciple’s Prologue and Tale
The Host pokes fun at the Cook, riding at the back of the company, blind drunk. The Cook is unable to honor the Host’s request that he tell a tale, and the Manciple criticizes him for his drunkenness. The Manciple relates the legend of a white crow, taken from the Roman poet Ovid’s Metamorphoses and one of the tales in The Arabian Nights. In it, Phoebus’s talking white crow informs him that his wife is cheating on him. Phoebus kills the wife, pulls out the crow’s white feathers, and curses it with blackness.
The Parson’s Prologue and Tale
As the company enters a village in the late afternoon, the Host calls upon the Parson to give them a fable. Refusing to tell a fictional story because it would go against the rule set by St. Paul, the Parson delivers a lengthy treatise on the Seven Deadly Sins, instead.
Chaucer’s Retraction
Chaucer appeals to readers to credit Jesus Christ as the inspiration for anything in his book that they like, and to attribute what they don’t like to his own ignorance and lack of ability. He retracts and prays for forgiveness for all of his works dealing with secular and pagan subjects, asking only to be remembered for what he has written of saints’ lives and homilies."
Of,"Two migrant workers, George and Lennie, have been let off a bus miles away from the California farm where they are due to start work. George is a small, dark man with “sharp, strong features.” Lennie, his companion, is his opposite, a giant of a man with a “shapeless” face. Overcome with thirst, the two stop in a clearing by a pool and decide to camp for the night. As the two converse, it becomes clear that Lennie has an intellectual disability, and is deeply devoted to George and dependent upon him for protection and guidance. George finds that Lennie, who loves petting soft things but often accidentally kills them, has been carrying and stroking a dead mouse. George angrily throws it away, fearing that Lennie might catch a disease from the dead animal. George complains loudly that his life would be easier without having to care for Lennie, but the reader senses that their friendship and devotion is mutual. He and Lennie share a dream of buying their own piece of land, farming it, and, much to Lennie’s delight, keeping rabbits. George ends the night by treating Lennie to the story he often tells him about what life will be like in such an idyllic place.
The next day, the men report to the nearby ranch. George, fearing how the boss will react to Lennie, insists that he’ll do all the talking. He lies, explaining that they travel together because they are cousins and that a horse kicked Lennie in the head when he was a child. They are hired. They meet Candy, an old “swamper,” or handyman, with a missing hand and an ancient dog, and Curley, the boss’s mean-spirited son. Curley is newly married, possessive of his flirtatious wife, and full of jealous suspicion. Once George and Lennie are alone in the bunkhouse, Curley’s wife appears and flirts with them. Lennie thinks she is “purty,” but George, sensing the trouble that could come from tangling with this woman and her husband, warns Lennie to stay away from her. Soon, the ranch-hands return from the fields for lunch, and George and Lennie meet Slim, the skilled mule driver who wields great authority on the ranch. Slim comments on the rarity of friendship like that between George and Lennie. Carlson, another ranch-hand, suggests that since Slim’s dog has just given birth, they should offer a puppy to Candy and shoot Candy’s old, good-for-nothing dog.
The next day, George confides in Slim that he and Lennie are not cousins, but have been friends since childhood. He tells how Lennie has often gotten them into trouble. For instance, they were forced to flee their last job because Lennie tried to touch a woman’s dress and was accused of rape. Slim agrees to give Lennie one of his puppies, and Carlson continues to badger Candy to kill his old dog. When Slim agrees with Carlson, saying that death would be a welcome relief to the suffering animal, Candy gives in. Carlson, before leading the dog outside, promises to do the job painlessly.
Slim goes to the barn to do some work, and Curley, who is maniacally searching for his wife, heads to the barn to accost Slim. Candy overhears George and Lennie discussing their plans to buy land, and offers his life’s savings if they will let him live there too. The three make a pact to let no one else know of their plan. Slim returns to the bunkhouse, berating Curley for his suspicions. Curley, searching for an easy target for his anger, finds Lennie and picks a fight with him. Lennie crushes Curley’s hand in the altercation. Slim warns Curley that if he tries to get George and Lennie fired, he will be the laughingstock of the farm.
The next night, most of the men go to the local brothel. Lennie is left with Crooks, the lonely, Black stable-hand, and Candy. Curley’s wife flirts with them, refusing to leave until the other men come home. She notices the cuts on Lennie’s face and suspects that he, and not a piece of machinery as Curley claimed, is responsible for hurting her husband. This thought amuses her. The next day, Lennie accidentally kills his puppy in the barn. Curley’s wife enters and consoles him. She admits that life with Curley is a disappointment, and wishes that she had followed her dream of becoming a movie star. Lennie tells her that he loves petting soft things, and she offers to let him feel her hair. When he grabs too tightly, she cries out. In his attempt to silence her, he accidentally breaks her neck.
Lennie flees back to a pool of the Salinas River that George had designated as a meeting place should either of them get into trouble. As the men back at the ranch discover what has happened and gather together a lynch party, George joins Lennie. Much to Lennie’s surprise, George is not mad at him for doing “a bad thing.” George begins to tell Lennie the story of the farm they will have together. As he describes the rabbits that Lennie will tend, the sound of the approaching lynch party grows louder. George shoots his friend in the back of the head.
When the other men arrive, George lets them believe that Lennie had the gun, and George wrestled it away from him and shot him. Only Slim understands what has really happened, that George has killed his friend out of mercy. Slim consolingly leads him away, and the other men, completely puzzled, watch them leave."
Incurring,"Returning home to the Laguna Pueblo reservation from World War II, via a Veteran's Hospital, Tayo must find a way to cure himself of his mental anguish, and to bring the rain back to his community. Combining prose and poetry, Ceremony interweaves the individual story of Tayo and the collective story of his people. As Tayo's journey unfolds, it is paralleled by poems telling old stories.
The trauma of thinking he saw his uncle Josiah's face among a crowd of Japanese soldiers he was ordered to shoot, and then of watching his cousin Rocky die, drove Tayo out of his mind. A period of time in a Veterans' Hospital gets him well enough to return to his home, with his Grandmother, his Auntie, and her husband Robert. This is the family unit that raised him after his mother, who had conceived him with an unknown white man, left him for good at the age of four. In his family's home Tayo faces not only their disappointment at the loss of Rocky, but also his continued grieving over his favorite uncle Josiah's death. He also contends with his guilt over a prayer against the rain he uttered in the forests of the Philippines, which he thinks is responsible for the six-year drought on the reservation.
As he slowly recuperates, Tayo realizes that he is not alone. His childhood friends Harley, Leroy, Emo, and Pinkie who also fought in the war contend with similar post-traumatic stress, self-medicating with alcohol. The company is little comfort. His old friends spend their drunken hours reminiscing about how great the war was and how much respect they got while they were in uniform. These stories only make Tayo think about the tremendous discrimination the Native Americans face at the hands of the whites, whom they nonetheless seem to admire, and he is even more saddened and infuriated. Just as Tayo begins to give up hope and to wish he could return to the VA hospital, his grandmother calls in the medicine man, Ku'oosh. Ku'oosh performs for Tayo a ceremony for warriors who have killed in battle, but both Ku'oosh and Tayo fear that the ancient ceremonies are not applicable to this new situation.
Tayo is helped but not cured by Ku'oosh's ceremony. It prompts him to consider his childhood, especially the summer before he left for the army. Although Auntie did her best to keep the two boys separate, Tayo and Rocky became close friends, and the summer after they graduated from high school, they enlisted in the army together. That summer, Josiah fell in love with Night Swan, a Mexican woman who lived just outside the reservation. At her urging, he invested in a herd of Mexican cattle, which Tayo helped him to care for. As so often happens, there is a drought that summer. Having heard the old stories of how droughts are ended, Tayo goes to a spring and invents a rain ceremony. The following day it rains. In addition to helping the crops and the cattle, the rain keeps Josiah from visiting Night Swan. He asks Tayo to bring her a note. Tayo delivers the note, and in the process is seduced by Night Swan.
Realizing that his ceremony has not been enough for Tayo, Ku'oosh sends him to the nearby town of Gallup to see another medicine man, Betonie, who knows more about the problems incurred by the contact between Native American and white cultures. Although he is skeptical of Betonie's strange ways and especially high connection with the white world, Tayo tells him of his what is troubling him. Betonie listens and explains that they must invent and complete a new ceremony. Tayo accepts. Betonie tells Tayo stores of the old ceremonies as he performs them. Then Betonie tells Tayo stories of his grandfather, Descheeny, and the beginning of the creation of a new ceremony to stop the destruction the whites, an invention of Native American witchery, are wreaking on the world.
Betonie sends Tayo back home, reminding him that the ceremony is still far from complete. When he meets Harley and Leroy on the way home, Tayo slips back into their lifestyle for a moment, but soon moves on, heeding the signs Betonie told him of as he searches for Josiah's cattle. Tayo follows the stars to a woman's house. After spending a night with the woman, Ts'eh, Tayo heads up into the mountains. He finds Josiah's cattle fenced into a white man's pasture. While Tayo breaks into the pasture, the cattle run off to its far reaches, and Tayo spends all night looking for them. As dawn approaches, Tayo is about to give up when a mountain lion comes up to him. Tayo honors the mountain lion, and follows its tracks to the cattle. Just as he herds the cattle out of the pasture, two white patrolmen find Tayo. Not realizing that the cattle are missing, but knowing Tayo has trespassed, the patrolmen arrest Tayo. Before they can bring him to town, however, they notice the mountain lion tracks and let Tayo go in order to hunt it. As Tayo heads out, it begins to snow. Tayo knows this will cover the tracks of his cattle and of the mountain lion, making the patrolmens' efforts fruitless. On the way down the mountain, Tayo meets a hunter, who lives with Ts'eh. When they arrive back at her house, she has corralled Tayo's cattle, which she keeps until Tayo and Robert return with a cattle truck to gather them up.
Returning home with Josiah's cattle, Tayo feels cured. However, the drought persists, and Tayo knows the ceremony is not complete. He goes to the family's ranch with the cattle, where he finds Ts'eh . They spend the summer together, but as it draws to an end Robert visits and warns Tayo that Emo has been spreading rumors about him. Shortly thereafter, Ts'eh tells Tayo that Emo and the white police are coming after him. Before she leaves, she tells Tayo how to avoid capture.
Following Ts'eh's instructions, Tayo easily evades the white police. Still running from Emo, he meets Harley and Leroy. Almost too late, Tayo realizes that Harley and Leroy have joined forces with Emo. Running again, Tayo finds himself in an abandoned uranium mine. As he looks at the gaping hole left in the earth, Tayo realizes that this is the last station of his ceremony, the one where he incorporates an element of white culture, the mine. All he has to do is to spend the night there and the ceremony will be complete. Soon Emo and Pinkie arrive. From a hiding place, Tayo must watch them torture Harley to death, and restrain himself from killing Emo in order to save Harley. With the help of the wind, Tayo survives the night. He returns home and goes back to Ku'oosh. After hearing all about Tayo's ceremony, Ku'oosh pronounces that Ts'eh was in fact A'moo'ooh, who has given her blessings to Tayo and his ceremony; the drought is ended and the destruction of the whites is stopped. Tayo spends one last night in Ku'oosh's house to finish off the ceremony, and then he returns home."
Regime,"Marjane “Marji” Satrapi is an intelligent, spirited, and very modern girl living with her parents in Iran’s capital of Tehran during the eventful period of Iranian history from the late 1970s into the early 1980s. In Persepolis: The Story of a Childhood, Marji’s remembers her life during those years, mostly from when she was about ten to age fourteen. This account includes how Marji and her family lived through and were affected by turbulent events that included the overthrow of the autocratic Shah of Iran by the Islamic revolution, the oppressive fundamentalist regime that replaced the Shah, and the devasting Iran-Iraq war.
The nation’s wealth has long made it a target of outside invaders, but Islamic revolution of 1979 has pushed out the Western-backed government of the Shah.  The revolution has ushered in a new Islamic regime that is bringing massive societal changes impacting how people are supposed to behave--including Marji and her family. Marji struggles to adjust to the changes at her liberal French bilingual school, which has become increasingly stricter. Girls are required to wear veils and female and male students are now separated. Marji’s wealthy and modern parents—her father, Ebi, and her mother, Taji—take part in the massive protests against the new regime’s strict rules on behavior (just as they had previously protested against the Shah’s regime). Marji’s parents worry when a photo of Marji’s mother a protest appears in newspapers magazines. Later, after a demonstration they are at turns violent, the Satrapis decide that openly protesting is too dangerous to continue to do.
Marji feels conflict between her own deeply spiritual feelings and the stark modernism of her parents. She talks to God at night and has believed she will become a prophet one day since she was six years old, Marji. But the revolution leads to Marji setting aside these ambitions while she studies and imitates protestors and revolutionaries. She mimics protestors in the garden of her house and studies books about famous revolutionaries and philosophers given to her by her parents. She fantasizes about becoming a hero and wants her parents to become heroes too. Marji’s relationship with God becomes strained, as she finds that she and God have less to talk about—although God does still come by to see her from time to time.
Marji thrills when she learns that rebels fill her family history. She learns that her grandfather was a prince and later a communist whom the Shah removed from power and that her uncle Anoosh, also a communist, spent nine years in prison during the Shah’s regime. Marji spends a short time with Anoosh, learning about his life. After the Shah fell from power in 1979, Anoosh was released from prison, but when Islamic fundamentalists consolidate their grip on power, they hunt Anoosh down, imprison him, and later execute him. Her new idol killed, Marji feels crushed. She completely abandons her faith in God and increasingly questions the pro-regime propaganda she hears—especially at school.
Marji deeply loves and identifies with of her parents, even if she does sometimes feel that their actions and behavior (as wealthy and privileged individuals) do not always live up to their pro-democratic and liberal rhetoric. Marji also has a special connection with her grandmother, who remains stoic and inspiring to Marji in spite of the turmoil and numerous tragedies stemming from political actions that impact her and the family. Marji’s uncle Anoosh is not Marji’s only direct experience with the cruel consequences of the government’s actions. Throughout the book, death and devastation occurs among Marji’s extended family and friends as direct results of the brutality and fanaticism of the Iranian regimes and the war with Iraq.
People had rejoiced when the Shah was forced out, but as Islamic fundamentalists retain power, Marji and her family watch as their neighbors’ behavior shifts back and forth to coincide with the current political winds. The neighbors go from wearing short skirts and drinking alcohol to covering themselves and denouncing the use of alcohol. Marji’s parents ask her to tell everyone that she prays every day, a lie they hope will keep Marji safe, but acknowledge that the rules seem foolish. Marji grows more rebellious, as she increasingly views the rules at school and elsewhere as hypocritical and difficult to follow. Armed with more knowledge and personal experience, Marji begins to act out in ways that put her safety at risk. In fact, she even (accidentally) hits her principal during an argument, which results in her expulsion from school. Fearing her rebellious behavior will get her killed, Marji’s mother tries to reason with Marji by telling her that it is not her responsibility to serve justice and that the bad guys eventually pay for their sins in the end.
The war with Iraq had originally inspired Marji to vocal patriotism in protection her country against another invasion, but Marji begins to realize there are greater forces behind the war. She sees how the Islamic regime needs the war to continue survive and keep power. The war promotes a sense of nationalism and pride in the public, and those who die in the war are hailed as “martyrs.” Marji sees thousands of poor boys lured into war without proper training. She becomes increasingly uncomfortable and aware of class differences within society. Poor young boys are lured into the army with gold-painted keys to the “kingdom of heaven” to help them enter paradise after dying on the battlefield, while children in her wealthy neighborhood are left alone.
More and more people try to escape Iran as the borders tighten and Iraqi forces bomb Tehran and other Iranian cities. Realizing that Marji’s chances of escaping Iran are narrowing, her parents make the difficult decision to send her abroad alone to finish school in Vienna, explaining that only a good education will free her of Iran. Marji feels heartbroken. She spends one last night with her grandmother, who gives her warm advice and inspires her to be compassionate and understanding while in Vienna. Marji gives away all of her prized contraband to her friends, including a Kim Wilde poster. At the airport, as Marji turns to say goodbye to her parents one last time to see that her mother, devasted by her only child’s departure, has fainted."
Fisheries,"The Old Man and the Sea is the story of an epic struggle between an old, seasoned fisherman and the greatest catch of his life. For eighty-four days, Santiago, an aged Cuban fisherman, has set out to sea and returned empty-handed. So conspicuously unlucky is he that the parents of his young, devoted apprentice and friend, Manolin, have forced the boy to leave the old man in order to fish in a more prosperous boat. Nevertheless, the boy continues to care for the old man upon his return each night. He helps the old man tote his gear to his ramshackle hut, secures food for him, and discusses the latest developments in American baseball, especially the trials of the old man’s hero, Joe DiMaggio. Santiago is confident that his unproductive streak will soon come to an end, and he resolves to sail out farther than usual the following day.
On the eighty-fifth day of his unlucky streak, Santiago does as promised, sailing his skiff far beyond the island’s shallow coastal waters and venturing into the Gulf Stream. He prepares his lines and drops them. At noon, a big fish, which he knows is a marlin, takes the bait that Santiago has placed one hundred fathoms deep in the waters. The old man expertly hooks the fish, but he cannot pull it in. Instead, the fish begins to pull the boat.
Unable to tie the line fast to the boat for fear the fish would snap a taut line, the old man bears the strain of the line with his shoulders, back, and hands, ready to give slack should the marlin make a run. The fish pulls the boat all through the day, through the night, through another day, and through another night. It swims steadily northwest until at last it tires and swims east with the current. The entire time, Santiago endures constant pain from the fishing line. Whenever the fish lunges, leaps, or makes a dash for freedom, the cord cuts Santiago badly. Although wounded and weary, the old man feels a deep empathy and admiration for the marlin, his brother in suffering, strength, and resolve.
On the third day the fish tires, and Santiago, sleep-deprived, aching, and nearly delirious, manages to pull the marlin in close enough to kill it with a harpoon thrust. Dead beside the skiff, the marlin is the largest Santiago has ever seen. He lashes it to his boat, raises the small mast, and sets sail for home. While Santiago is excited by the price that the marlin will bring at market, he is more concerned that the people who will eat the fish are unworthy of its greatness.
As Santiago sails on with the fish, the marlin’s blood leaves a trail in the water and attracts sharks. The first to attack is a great mako shark, which Santiago manages to slay with the harpoon. In the struggle, the old man loses the harpoon and lengths of valuable rope, which leaves him vulnerable to other shark attacks. The old man fights off the successive vicious predators as best he can, stabbing at them with a crude spear he makes by lashing a knife to an oar, and even clubbing them with the boat’s tiller. Although he kills several sharks, more and more appear, and by the time night falls, Santiago’s continued fight against the scavengers is useless. They devour the marlin’s precious meat, leaving only skeleton, head, and tail. Santiago chastises himself for going “out too far,” and for sacrificing his great and worthy opponent. He arrives home before daybreak, stumbles back to his shack, and sleeps very deeply.
The next morning, a crowd of amazed fishermen gathers around the skeletal carcass of the fish, which is still lashed to the boat. Knowing nothing of the old man’s struggle, tourists at a nearby café observe the remains of the giant marlin and mistake it for a shark. Manolin, who has been worried sick over the old man’s absence, is moved to tears when he finds Santiago safe in his bed. The boy fetches the old man some coffee and the daily papers with the baseball scores, and watches him sleep. When the old man wakes, the two agree to fish as partners once more. The old man returns to sleep and dreams his usual dream of lions at play on the beaches of Africa."
Borders,"Growing up during the last days of the British colonial presence in Egypt, Leila Ahmed’s childhood is marked by a collision of cultures. Among Syrians, Lebanese, Palestinians, and other Egyptians from a similar class background in school, young Ahmed considers it quite normal to grow up speaking English or French and being called by the anglicized name “Lily” in school. Ahmed lives in Cairo, at the crossroads of spiritual hubs, ancient sites, and modern sprawl, in a beautiful house known as Ain Shams. Her father is an esteemed engineer who, as chairman of the Nile Water Control Board, had run into trouble with the government for opposing their plan to build the High Dam on ecological grounds. Though her father’s concerns about the fate of the Nile River will ultimately be born out by the facts, his opposition to the government’s grand improvement project will haunt him for years to come. Later, he will be harassed by authorities and have his bank account frozen.
As a young child, Ahmed is very attached to Nanny, her Croatian governess. Nanny is a deeply religious Christian and tells Ahmed stories of angels and the supernatural. Ahmed has a more conflicted relationship with her mother. Ahmed aspires to be a professional and views her mother with contempt for not working. Later, when Ahmed’s father falls ill with chronic pneumonia, Ahmed will come to value her mother’s dedication more, as well as the strength of the bond between her parents. One of Ahmed’s closest childhood friends is Gina, a neighbor girl and the daughter of Italian parents. Gina’s older brother, Freddy, subjects Ahmed to brutal and sexual games when she is around eight years old, and when Ahmed’s mother finds out about it, she beats her and takes her to a doctor to be examined. In the aftermath of this event, Ahmed is forbidden to play outside, even with Gina, and is subjected to her mother’s disdain, furthering the rift between mother and daughter.
Ahmed’s view of Islam is shaped through the time she spends at her mother’s childhood home of Zatoun, in Cairo, where Ahmed is surrounded by a rich and engaging community of women. While listening to her mother, grandmother, and other women converse, Ahmed learns about Islam as being a generous and pacifistic faith. Though she receives no direct religious instruction from these women, and her father has decided not to send her to an Islamic school, Ahmed nonetheless comes to appreciate the oral, living tradition of Islam, which, in contrast to the rigid, authoritative Islam that is handed down in texts, encompasses many interpretations. As much as she recognizes the positive force that this humane form of Islam has manifested in her family’s life, she also recognizes the powerlessness of her mother and grandmother in the society they live in. Ahmed’s grandmother, for instance, has for years been mourning the suicide of her son Fuad, a tragedy she blames on her husband’s disapproval of Fuad. A similar fate befell Grandmother’s daughter Aida, who committed suicide after being unable to secure permission for a divorce from an unhappy marriage through the stern figure of Grandfather. Because of these tragedies, the estate of Zatoun always seems to have a pall of gloom over it in young Ahmed’s eyes.
Ahmed attends a British school in the suburbs of Cairo and prefers play to work, though her test scores and voracious appetite for books help her move ahead quickly in school. Jews and Muslims at the school are excused from the daily Christian prayers, and that’s how Ahmed meets and befriends Joyce, a Jewish girl in her grade. Ahmed is encouraged to skip a grade, but her academic ambitions are tempered by the school’s English headmaster, Mr. Price, who accuses her of plagiarizing her own well-written essays. Ahmed likewise finds her English teachers discouraging of her ambitions of pursuing science or mathematics. In school, Ahmed studies the history, geography, and flora and fauna of Europe, while learning little about that of her own country. Still, Ahmed isn’t completely insulated from the politics of her day. She recognizes the growing influence of a group called the Muslim Brotherhood, which stands in opposition to colonialism and Western influence in the Middle East.
Ahmed is soon headed to Cambridge, England, to study literature, a place she reveres as an intellectual wonderland and the embodiment of all the things she remembers reading in English books as a child—forests, fog, turrets, and towers. Here, Ahmed finds a different kind of community of women in teachers like Mrs. Madge and Miss Bradbrook, and with friends like Veena, an Indian woman who shares some of Ahmed’s feelings of displacement. At Cambridge, Ahmed experiences a more genteel form of racism, a feeling of being lumped together with all the people who aren’t part of the white British establishment, no matter what their race or cultural background. Between her undergraduate and graduate days, Ahmed returns to Egypt to find it totally changed. Her father is gravely ill, and she can tell that her mother had suffered the burden of her father’s illness as well as persecution via Nasser’s increasingly repressive regime. Upon returning to Cambridge to begin graduate studies, Ahmed meets Alan, the man she will marry and eventually divorce.
During her graduate studies, Ahmed yearns for a place in the academy for the voices from the margins—blacks, women, and people from the third world. Toward the end of her graduate student days, Ahmed begins to suffer from a mysterious illness. After several frustrating visits with different doctors, Ahmed is finally diagnosed with sarcodosis, a chronic autoimmune disease. Ahmed reads Edward Said’s Orientalism while trying to sort out her place as an Egyptian woman in the West. After leaving Cambridge, Ahmed accepts a teaching position in Abu Dhabi and joins a committee to help reform education throughout the United Arab Emirates. Recognizing the unique qualities of this “Gulf Arabic” culture helps her to re-examine the implications of her own “Egyptian Arabic” identity and her place in the larger Arab world. Ahmed moves to the United States and finds that the atmosphere in women’s studies departments in the 1980s is not exactly hospitable to the viewpoints of women from other cultures. However, she does find her new environment exciting and intellectually stimulating, and even as she endeavors to make a contribution to her the world of ideas in her new home, she never turns her back on her Egyptian heritage."
Business,"Lawyer Bryan Stevenson gives a first-person account of his decades helping marginalized Americans who have been unfairly and harshly punished by the U.S. criminal justice system, which disproportionately targets people of color and poor people. At the heart of Just Mercy is the story of Walter McMillian, a Black man who was framed for the murder of a girl named Ronda Morrison, convicted, and sent to death row. 
Stevenson alternates chapters about Walter with his personal reflections on our country’s history with racial disparity and issues around incarceration. Stevenson highlights other groups of vulnerable people who have been victimized by the criminal justice system and shares the stories of the prisoners he has helped over the years. The book also follows the growth of Stevenson’s nonprofit law project, the Alabama-based Equal Justice Initiative (EJI), through its expansion from focusing on death row prisoners to helping people sentenced to life without parole. Stevenson chronicles how EJI becomes a significant force in criminal justice reform.
In 1983 as a law student, Stevenson discovers his life’s passion when he interns with the Georgia-based Southern Prisoners Defense Committee and meets his first death row prisoner. After graduation Stevenson accepts a job with the organization to represent poor prisoners, including those in Alabama who lack any public defender. He meets Walter McMillian on Alabama’s death row. Walter owns a successful business but also transgresses racial boundaries when he has an affair with a white woman. Soon after the affair becomes public, the woman’s friend, Ralph Myers, accuses Walter of committing the unsolved murder of Ronda Morrison, which has outraged the community. Law enforcement, including a racist sheriff and the district attorney, eagerly pounces on this accusation, overlooking Walter’s alibi and a lack of evidence. Instead, they actively force Ralph to stick with his story even when he tries to recant. They coerce other false witness testimonies, and—as revealed years later—actively suppress evidence.
After Stevenson and the team at EJI unsuccessfully appeal Walter’s conviction, they launch their own investigation of the crime and uncover new evidence. They find witnesses who can prove the witnesses against Walter lied as well as financial records that indicate that one of these witnesses was paid to give false testimony. Stevenson and his team also petition for and receive all records from Walter’s trial. However, their big break comes when they receive a phone call from Ralph, who now wants to make amends. Ralph admits to lying about Walter and says he was threatened by law enforcement. Stevenson wins a hearing for Walter where he can present his new evidence: Ralph’s testimony, which is confirmed by health care workers and other inmates, as well as recordings of the law enforcement team threatening Ralph if he doesn’t frame Walter. 
While the judge refuses to grant Walter relief, Stevenson continues the appeal process through the Alabama courts. The district attorney asks outside agents to investigate the murder for which Walter was convicted, and the investigators determine that Walter had nothing to do with the crime. Six weeks later, the court invalidates Walter’s conviction. Stevenson and the State file a joint motion to dismiss the charges, and Walter is set free.
Throughout the process, Stevenson and Walter become close friends, and Stevenson helps Walter upon his release, including filing a civil suit on his behalf and offering him a place to stay. Walter works with Stevenson to share his story, giving interviews and speaking at legal conferences, and Walter is even featured in a documentary. Unfortunately, Walter is diagnosed with advancing dementia and is forced to rely on family and eventually a nursing facility for his care. He dies in 2013. Stevenson gives a eulogy at his funeral and shares all he learned from Walter, particularly that we must extend mercy to everyone, even those who have not earned it.
Interspersed with chapters chronicling Walter’s narrative are stories of Stevenson’s other clients and work. His closeness with these prisoners and their horrifying circumstances makes Stevenson more determined to help and causes him to reflect on abstract issues that nevertheless imbue the criminal justice system, like humanity and mercy. Stevenson focuses on several categories of vulnerable people who become trapped in the system, including mentally ill prisoners, disabled prisoners, and poor women who give birth to stillborn babies. 
Stevenson and his team at EJI also become increasingly focused on juvenile offenders who are sometimes tried as adults despite their young age. These offenders may be given de facto death sentences by being sentenced to life without parole and face perilous circumstances when they are housed in adult prisons. Stevenson illustrates how these prisoners retain their own humanity while being forced to live under inhumane conditions. He also discusses some of the qualities common among these types of prisoners: They are generally poor and disproportionately people of color, and most of them lack adequate legal counsel. The juveniles have horrific backgrounds of abuse and neglect.
Stevenson and his team at EJI also work to change the legal system to offer more protection to marginalized people. Several of his cases end up before the U.S. Supreme Court, and he succeeds in winning rulings that ban as unconstitutional the conviction of children to life without parole and the execution of people deemed incompetent from dementia or neurological disease. EJI works to raise public awareness of issues surrounding unfair incarceration, produces groundbreaking reports on racial issues, and sets up programs to help formerly incarcerated people adjust to life on the outside.
Stevenson also reflects on the issues that surround the criminal justice system. His time spent with prisoners awaiting their execution makes him realize how inhumane it is to prepare another human to die. After decades of work, when Stevenson fails to prevent the execution of a man who suffers from an intellectual disability, he momentarily feels unable to continue his work. However, he realizes that he cannot help but be broken by his experiences and comes to understand that it is his own brokenness that allows him to more fully understand the need for mercy and to bring compassion to others. The book ends with Stevenson’s renewed commitment to helping others."
Intricate,"Guy Montag is a fireman who burns books in a futuristic American city. In Montag’s world, firemen start fires rather than putting them out. The people in this society do not read books, enjoy nature, spend time by themselves, think independently, or have meaningful conversations. Instead, they drive very fast, watch excessive amounts of television on wall-size sets, and listen to the radio on “Seashell Radio” sets attached to their ears.
Montag encounters a gentle seventeen-year-old girl named Clarisse McClellan, who opens his eyes to the emptiness of his life with her innocently penetrating questions and her unusual love of people and nature. Over the next few days, Montag experiences a series of disturbing events. First, his wife, Mildred, attempts suicide by swallowing a bottle of sleeping pills. Then, when he responds to an alarm that an old woman has a stash of hidden literature, the woman shocks him by choosing to be burned alive along with her books. A few days later, he hears that Clarisse has been killed by a speeding car. Montag’s dissatisfaction with his life increases, and he begins to search for a solution in a stash of books that he has stolen from his own fires and hidden inside an air-conditioning vent.
When Montag fails to show up for work, his fire chief, Beatty, pays a visit to his house. Beatty explains that it’s normal for a fireman to go through a phase of wondering what books have to offer, and he delivers a dizzying monologue explaining how books came to be banned in the first place. According to Beatty, special-interest groups and other “minorities” objected to books that offended them. Soon, books all began to look the same, as writers tried to avoid offending anybody. This was not enough, however, and society as a whole decided to simply burn books rather than permit conflicting opinions. Beatty tells Montag to take twenty-four hours or so to see if his stolen books contain anything worthwhile and then turn them in for incineration. Montag begins a long and frenzied night of reading.
Overwhelmed by the task of reading, Montag looks to his wife for help and support, but she prefers television to her husband’s company and cannot understand why he would want to take the terrible risk of reading books. He remembers that he once met a retired English professor named Faber sitting in a park, and he decides that this man might be able to help him understand what he reads. He visits Faber, who tells him that the value of books lies in the detailed awareness of life that they contain. Faber says that Montag needs not only books but also the leisure to read them and the freedom to act upon their ideas.
Faber agrees to help Montag with his reading, and they concoct a risky scheme to overthrow the status quo. Faber will contact a printer and begin reproducing books, and Montag will plant books in the homes of firemen to discredit the profession and to destroy the machinery of censorship. Faber gives him a two-way radio earpiece (the “green bullet”) so that he can hear what Montag hears and talk to him secretly.
Montag goes home, and soon two of his wife’s friends arrive to watch television. The women discuss their families and the war that is about to be declared in an extremely frivolous manner. Their superficiality angers him, and he takes out a book of poetry and reads “Dover Beach” by Matthew Arnold. Faber buzzes in his ear for him to be quiet, and Mildred tries to explain that the poetry reading is a standard way for firemen to demonstrate the uselessness of literature. The women are extremely disturbed by the poem and leave to file a complaint against Montag.
Montag goes to the fire station and hands over one of his books to Beatty. Beatty confuses Montag by barraging him with contradictory quotations from great books. Beatty exploits these contradictions to show that literature is morbid and dangerously complex, and that it deserves incineration. Suddenly, the alarm sounds, and they rush off to answer the call, only to find that the alarm is at Montag’s own house. Mildred gets into a cab with her suitcase, and Montag realizes that his own wife has betrayed him.
Beatty forces Montag to burn the house himself; when he is done, Beatty places him under arrest. When Beatty continues to berate Montag, Montag turns the flamethrower on his superior and proceeds to burn him to ashes. Montag knocks the other firemen unconscious and runs. The Mechanical Hound, a monstrous machine that Beatty has set to attack Montag, pounces and injects Montag’s leg with a large dose of anesthetic. Montag manages to destroy it with his flamethrower; then he walks off the numbness in his leg and escapes with some books that were hidden in his backyard. He hides these in another fireman’s house and calls in an alarm from a pay phone.
Montag goes to Faber’s house, where he learns that a new Hound has been put on his trail, along with several helicopters and a television crew. Faber tells Montag that he is leaving for St. Louis to see a retired printer who may be able to help them. Montag gives Faber some money and tells him how to remove Montag’s scent from his house so the Hound will not enter it. Montag then takes some of Faber’s old clothes and runs off toward the river. The whole city watches as the chase unfolds on TV, but Montag manages to escape in the river and change into Faber’s clothes to disguise his scent. He drifts downstream into the country and follows a set of abandoned railroad tracks until he finds a group of renegade intellectuals (“the Book People”), led by a man named Granger, who welcome him. They are a part of a nationwide network of book lovers who have memorized many great works of literature and philosophy. They hope that they may be of some help to mankind in the aftermath of the war that has just been declared. Montag’s role is to memorize the Book of Ecclesiastes. Enemy jets appear in the sky and completely obliterate the city with bombs. Montag and his new friends move on to search for survivors and rebuild civilization."
Perceive,"All the Light We Cannot See traces the stories of three characters whose lives intersect during the bombing of the German-occupied French town of Saint-Malo in August 1944. Marie-Laure Leblanc grows up in Paris, where her father, Daniel Leblanc, works as a locksmith at the Museum of Natural History. As a young girl, Marie-Laure goes blind, but her father teaches her to navigate their neighborhood independently by building her a scale model of the neighborhood to learn from. In June 1940, when she is 12 years old, the threat of a German occupation of Paris grows too great to ignore. Marie-Laure and Daniel flee from Paris to Saint-Malo, where they move in with her great-uncle, Etienne, and his housekeeper, Madame Manec.
        
Unbeknownst to Marie-Laure, Daniel carries a potentially significant item with him when he leaves Paris. The Museum of Natural History owns a legendary diamond called the Sea of Flames. Under the threat of occupation, the museum directors make three copies. Three of the four stones are sent off with various staff members, including Daniel, while the final one remains at the Museum. No one knows if the stone they possess is real or a copy. Once in Saint-Malo, Daniel works to build a scale model of the town so that Marie-Laure can learn to navigate it, and he also hides the diamond in the replica he makes of Etienne’s house. In December 1940, Daniel is summoned back to Paris, and on the journey there, he is arrested. He is taken to a prison camp in Germany, where he eventually dies.
Madame Manec has organized many of the French townspeople into engaging in acts of resistance against their German occupiers. Although Etienne is initially hesitant, he and Marie-Laure eventually begin to take part. Etienne has a special contribution to make: hidden in a secret attic floor of his house is a powerful radio transmitter. Before the war, Etienne used it to broadcast recordings of his deceased brother presenting science programming for children as a way of keeping his memory alive. Now, he uses the radio transmitter to broadcast codes and messages as a way of thwarting the German war effort. This action allows him and Marie-Laure to remain hopeful, even after Madame Manec dies in 1942.
Meanwhile, a boy named Werner Pfennig grows up in an orphanage in Germany with his sister, Jutta. Werner is extremely gifted with mathematical, technological, and scientific knowledge. After he and Jutta find an abandoned radio by accident, Werner teaches himself to repair and rebuild electronics. He is also able to listen to a mysterious French program where a man explains scientific concepts in simple language.  As the Nazi party comes to power in Germany, Werner’s talents attract local attention, and when he is fourteen, he is accepted into a specialized training school. He hopes this opportunity will give him a brighter future, but Jutta fears that her brother will be corrupted by Nazi ideology. Indeed, once Werner is at school, he witnesses a lot of cruelty and brutality, including his close friend being beaten until he suffers severe brain damage.
When Werner is sixteen, his age is falsified so that he can serve on the German front lines. He spends the next two years travelling around, tracking down any civilians who use illegal radios in occupied German territory. Werner works alongside a fellow German soldier named Volkheimer. Although Werner tries to ignore the moral conflict he experiences, he is particularly horrified when one of his fellow soldiers kills a woman and young child. By spring 1944, he and his colleagues are sent to Saint-Malo, where he is astonished to discover that a man with the same voice as the one from the program he listened to as a child is broadcasting secret codes. Unsure what to do, Werner keeps this information secret but also spies on the house from which the signal is broadcasted and catches sight of Marie-Laure.
During this same time period, a Nazi official named von Rumpel has been ordered to seize and catalogue jewels from occupied German territories. He becomes obsessed with finding the legendary Sea of Flames, especially because he is suffering from cancer and believes that the diamond will grant him immortality. Between 1940 and 1944, he gradually tracks down three out of four stones, but the genuine one continues to elude him. He finally traces the stone to Daniel Leblanc’s last known residence: Saint-Malo. In August 1944, Allied forces begin bombing Saint-Malo. All three characters are affected by the bombing: Werner becomes trapped in a cellar when a building collapses on him, Marie-Laure is alone in her house, unsure what to do, and von Rumpel seizes the opportunity to go to the house to search for the diamond. When she hears a stranger enter the house, Marie-Laure hides in the attic with Etienne’s radio transmitter, taking the diamond with her. Over the course of four days, she stays hidden, broadcasting messages that Werner receives while trapped in the cellar.
Werner eventually escapes from the cellar and rushes to the house. Von Rumpel believes that Werner is also looking for the diamond, and when he threatens the young soldier, Werner shoots and kills him. Marie-Laure is then finally able to come out of hiding and Werner helps her to get to safety. As they flee the town, Marie-Laure leaves the diamond in a hidden grotto and gives the key to the grotto to Werner. They part ways, and Marie-Laure reunites with Etienne and goes to live with him in Paris. Werner is imprisoned and falls ill. A few months later, while he is delirious, he accidentally steps on a landmine and dies. Years later, in 1974, some of Werner’s possessions are sent to Volkheimer, and Volkheimer takes them to Jutta. Jutta follows these clues to eventually meet Marie-Laure, who has gone on to become a scientist and have a child. Although Marie-Laure wonders if Werner might have gone back to pick up the diamond, it seems most likely that the gemstone was left in the grotto to be washed into the sea."
Thus,"Ten years have passed since the fall of Troy, and the Greek hero Odysseus still has not returned to his kingdom in Ithaca. A large and rowdy mob of suitors who have overrun Odysseus’s palace and pillaged his land continue to court his wife, Penelope. She has remained faithful to Odysseus. Prince Telemachus, Odysseus’s son, wants desperately to throw them out but does not have the confidence or experience to fight them. One of the suitors, Antinous, plans to assassinate the young prince, eliminating the only opposition to their dominion over the palace.
Read more about The Odyssey’s precursor, The Iliad.
Unknown to the suitors, Odysseus is still alive. The beautiful nymph Calypso, possessed by love for him, has imprisoned him on her island, Ogygia. He longs to return to his wife and son, but he has no ship or crew to help him escape. While the gods and goddesses of Mount Olympus debate Odysseus’s future, Athena, Odysseus’s strongest supporter among the gods, resolves to help Telemachus. Disguised as a friend of the prince’s grandfather, Laertes, she convinces the prince to call a meeting of the assembly at which he reproaches the suitors. Athena also prepares him for a great journey to Pylos and Sparta, where the kings Nestor and Menelaus, Odysseus’s companions during the war, inform him that Odysseus is alive and trapped on Calypso’s island. Telemachus makes plans to return home, while, back in Ithaca, Antinous and the other suitors prepare an ambush to kill him when he reaches port.
On Mount Olympus, Zeus sends Hermes to rescue Odysseus from Calypso. Hermes persuades Calypso to let Odysseus build a ship and leave. The homesick hero sets sail, but when Poseidon, god of the sea, finds him sailing home, he sends a storm to wreck Odysseus’s ship. Poseidon has harbored a bitter grudge against Odysseus since the hero blinded his son, the Cyclops Polyphemus, earlier in his travels. Athena intervenes to save Odysseus from Poseidon’s wrath, and the beleaguered king lands at Scheria, home of the Phaeacians. Nausicaa, the Phaeacian princess, shows him to the royal palace, and Odysseus receives a warm welcome from the king and queen. When he identifies himself as Odysseus, his hosts, who have heard of his exploits at Troy, are stunned. They promise to give him safe passage to Ithaca, but first they beg to hear the story of his adventures.
Odysseus spends the night describing the fantastic chain of events leading up to his arrival on Calypso’s island. He recounts his trip to the Land of the Lotus Eaters, his battle with Polyphemus the Cyclops, his love affair with the witch-goddess Circe, his temptation by the deadly Sirens, his journey into Hades to consult the prophet Tiresias, and his fight with the sea monster Scylla. When he finishes his story, the Phaeacians return Odysseus to Ithaca, where he seeks out the hut of his faithful swineherd, Eumaeus. Though Athena has disguised Odysseus as a beggar, Eumaeus warmly receives and nourishes him in the hut. He soon encounters Telemachus, who has returned from Pylos and Sparta despite the suitors’ ambush, and reveals to him his true identity. Odysseus and Telemachus devise a plan to massacre the suitors and regain control of Ithaca.
When Odysseus arrives at the palace the next day, still disguised as a beggar, he endures abuse and insults from the suitors. The only person who recognizes him is his old nurse, Eurycleia, but she swears not to disclose his secret. Penelope takes an interest in this strange beggar, suspecting that he might be her long-lost husband. Quite crafty herself, Penelope organizes an archery contest the following day and promises to marry any man who can string Odysseus’s great bow and fire an arrow through a row of twelve axes—a feat that only Odysseus has ever been able to accomplish. At the contest, each suitor tries to string the bow and fails. Odysseus steps up to the bow and, with little effort, fires an arrow through all twelve axes. He then turns the bow on the suitors. He and Telemachus, assisted by a few faithful servants, kill every last suitor.
Odysseus reveals himself to the entire palace and reunites with his loving Penelope. He travels to the outskirts of Ithaca to see his aging father, Laertes. They come under attack from the vengeful family members of the dead suitors, but Laertes, reinvigorated by his son’s return, successfully kills Antinous’s father and puts a stop to the attack. Zeus dispatches Athena to restore peace. With his power secure and his family reunited, Odysseus’s long ordeal comes to an end."
Souls,"In this book, originally published in 1903, W. E. B. Du Bois has collected fourteen of his own essays about life after the Civil War, especially in the South. While the book predominantly deals with Black society and the life of “freedmen,” it also discusses how white society evolved after Emancipation. Throughout the text, Du Bois presents specific examples of racial injustice and inequality in the South. Before each essay, Du Bois includes a poem (or an excerpt from a poem or song) appropriate to the essay’s subject matter. Every inclusion is “a bar of the Sorrow Songs,—some echo of haunting melody from the only American music which welled up from the black souls in the dark past.” Du Bois revisits the significance of these inclusions at the end of the book.
While each essay examines a particular piece of the evolution of Black society, they are arranged to give the reader a historical perspective. Chapter I and Chapter II deal with the history and immediate impact of Emancipation, using historical examples and Du Bois’s own experience. Chapter III. specifically discusses the formation and responsibility of Black leadership, while criticizing Booker T. Washington on an academic level. Du Bois goes on to describe the Atlanta Compromise and the limitations it has placed on Black society in the South. Chapter IV through Chapter VII discuss the need for progress, and how it is blocked by lack of education and opportunity. He stresses that current systems produce mostly laborers, and that there is little room for Black upward mobility, especially in the South, due to a lack of education (and college-educated individuals). In Chapter VIII and Chapter IX, Du Bois describes visiting Dougherty County in rural Georgia. His first-hand experiences there are contrasted with his upbringing in New England, to show not only that there is greater disparity in the South, but also that many Black people in the South are not fully aware of it. In Chapter VI and Chapter VII, Du Bois draws on analogies to mythology to better explain the challenges he sees in the upbringing of Black men. In Chapter X., Du Bois examines the religion of the Black South. 
Chapters XI, XII, and XIII offer narrative examples of individuals Du Bois has encountered and events from Du Bois’s own life to illustrate the disparity between white and Black society. He discusses the death of his young son, pays tribute to a world-traveling preacher who remained undiscouraged, and recalls a student who had great potential but was a victim of his circumstances. Du Bois admits that these men are not well-known to history, but he considers their experiences are worthy of study. The final chapter, Chapter XIV, has several selections of “Sorrow Songs” that Du Bois describes as the “spiritual heritage of the nation.” He describes how the songs have been handed down, many from before slavery, and how they have become interconnected with religion and are still a centerpiece in Black society. 
Throughout the work, Du Bois uses historical fact and narrative example to establish how slavery and its aftereffects have shaped both Black and white society in the South. As a teacher, he then examines each situation academically. He presents cause and effect relationships and applies sociological analysis to them. The largest problem Du Bois discusses is the shortage of resources and opportunity for Black people at the beginning of the 20th century. He points out the effects of disparities in education and privilege and demonstrates the need for change."
Frequent,"In Common Sense, Thomas Paine argues for American independence. His argument begins with more general, theoretical reflections about government and religion, then progresses onto the specifics of the colonial situation.
Paine begins by distinguishing between government and society. Society, according to Paine, is everything constructive and good that people join together to accomplish. Government, on the other hand, is an institution whose sole purpose is to protect us from our own vices. Government has its origins in the evil of man and is therefore a necessary evil at best. Paine says that government's sole purpose is to protect life, liberty and property, and that a government should be judged solely on the basis of the extent to which it accomplishes this goal.
Paine then considers an imagined scenario in which a small group of people has been placed on an island, and cut off from the rest of society. In time, these people develop ties with one another, and lawmaking becomes inevitable. Paine says the people will be much happier if they are responsible for the creation of the laws that rule them. Paine is also implicitly arguing that such a system of representation is also better for the American colonists. Having expressed his disagreement with British reign in America, Paine proceeds to launch a general attack on the British system of government. Paine says the British system is too complex and rife with contradictions, and that the monarchy is granted far too much power. The British system pretends to offer a reasonable system of checks and balances, but in fact, it does not.
From here Paine moves on to discuss, in general, the notions of monarchy and hereditary succession. Man, Pain argues, was born into a state of equality, and the distinction that has arisen between king and subject is an unnatural one. At first, Paine says, the world was without kings, but the ancient Jews decided they wanted a king. This angered God, but he allowed them to have one. Paine presents pages of biblical evidence detailing God's wrath at the idea of the Jews having a king. The conclusion Paine reaches is that the practice of monarchy originates from sin, and is an institution that the Bible and God condemn. Paine calls hereditary succession an abominable practice. He says that even if people were to choose to have a king, that does not legitimize that King's child acting as a future ruler. Furthermore, hereditary succession has brought with it innumerable evils, such as incompetent kings, corruption, and civil war.
Having dispensed with the preliminary theoretical issues, Paine sets in to discuss the details of the American situation. In response to the argument that America has flourished under British rule, and therefore ought to stay under the king, Paine says that such an argument fails to realize that America has evolved and no longer needs Britain's help. Some say that Britain has protected America, and therefore deserves allegiance, but Paine responds that Britain has only watched over America in order to secure its own economic well-being. Paine adds that most recently, instead of watching over the colonies, the British have been attacking them, and are therefore undeserving of American loyalty.
Paine says that the colonies have little to gain from remaining attached to Britain. Commerce can be better conducted with the rest of Europe, but only after America becomes independent. Paine also asserts that if the colonies remain attached to Britain, the same problems that have arisen in the past will arise in the future. Paine argues that it is necessary to seek independence now, as to do otherwise would only briefly cover up problems that will surely reemerge.
Paine even proposes the form of government that the independent colonies should adopt. His recommendation is for a representative democracy that gives roughly equal weight to each of the colonies.
Paine explains why the current time is a good time to break free of Britain. Primarily, Paine focuses on the present size of the colonies, and on their current capabilities. He presents an inventory of the British Navy and gives calculations revealing how America could build a navy of comparable size. Paine recommends this as a way of ensuring America's security and prosperity in trade. Paine also argues that America is sufficiently small as to be united now. If time were to elapse, and the population of the colonies to grow, the same feeling of unity would not be present. Paine adds that if the Americans revolt now, they can use the vast expanses of uncharted land to the West in order to pay down some of the debt they will incur.
Paine says that as a colony of Britain, America lacks respectability on the international scene. They are seen simply as rebels, and cannot form substantial alliances with other nations. In order to prosper in the long term, the colonies need to be independent. Paine says that, by declaring independence, America will be able to ask for the help of other countries in its struggle for freedom. For all of these reasons, Paine says it is imperative and urgent that the colonies declare independence."
Contented,"Educated is primarily retrospective, consisting of Tara Westover's memories about her past. She tells the story of the events of her life from a vantage point in her late twenties, occasionally interjecting to comment on the process of trying to arrive at an accurate version of the past. Tara was born the youngest of seven children to parents whom she refers to as Faye and Gene (pseudonyms). The Westover family lived on a farm in rural Idaho, where Gene made a living salvaging scrap metal while Faye worked as an unlicensed midwife and herbal healer. Gene suffered from paranoid fears about interference from the federal government, and as a result he refused to allow his children to attend school, receive birth certificates, or receive medical attention. Gene was also a devout Mormon who believed in radical self-sufficiency and an impending Day of Judgement.
		
Shifts in the Westover family dynamic began to emerge when Tara was about nine. Her mother's work as a midwife increased her sense of independence, but after sustaining a serious and untreated brain injury in a car accident, Faye began to lose confidence in her skills, and focused instead on using herbal remedies and a form of intuitive healing. Around this time, Tyler (the third son) announced that he was going to attend college, which estranged him from his family. Tyler's absence forced Tara to become more involved in helping her father with his scrapping work, which left her constantly exposed to the possibility of dangerous injury. It also made her more curious about possibly pursuing an education herself. When Tara was ten, she told her disapproving father that she wanted to begin going to school, but nothing came of the idea.
As Tara grew into her teens, she acquired more independence from her family due to taking on various jobs and pursuing singing and musical theatre in the local community. However, her life was dominated by the strict rules and religious doctrine her father imposed, and Tara often worried about becoming sinful. When Tara was thirteen, her older brother Shawn moved back home. At first Shawn and Tara were close and spent a lot of time together. When Tara was about fifteen, however, Shawn began to be physically abusive toward her. His behavior only got worse after Shawn experienced a head injury. Tyler eventually realized that Shawn was hurting Tara, and he urged Tara to seriously consider applying to college and getting away from the family. Although she was uncertain at first, Tara began to study and was eventually accepted at Brigham Young University, having passed herself off as homeschooled.
In January 2004, when Tara was seventeen years old, she moved to Utah to begin her college education. She found the adjustment very difficult at first, but eventually began to excel in her studies. Tara's finances were precarious, and she had to hold multiple jobs and maintain very high grades to retain her scholarship. Her emerging independence also caused a threatening dynamic between her, Gene, and Shawn. Whenever Tara returned to Buck's Peak, her father manipulated her into working for him, while Shawn continued to physically and emotionally abuse her. Tara eventually confided to a bishop about her life, and he helped her to secure funding to finance her education. Tara's studies, and the people she met, also gradually opened her eyes to different realities and force her to realize how damaging and isolating her childhood has been. Tara eventually changed her major to studying history, and is encouraged to apply for a study abroad program at Cambridge University in England.
Tara's experience at Cambridge broadened her horizons even further, and she was encouraged to consider graduate studies. Tara still felt isolated from her peers, and ashamed of her origins. She hid most of her past even from her friends and the men she occasionally dated. She was eventually awarded a prestigious Cambridge Gates Fellowship and moved to England to pursue a Master's degree. She remained in close contact with her family and returned to Idaho regularly to visit, but her relationship with them deteriorated. Shawn was growing increasingly erratic and violent, and Tara feared for the safety of his wife and young child. By chance, she revealed to her sister Audrey that Shawn had been abusive with her, and Audrey later confided that Shawn abused her as well. Audrey blamed herself for not protecting her younger sister, and suggested that she and Tara confront their parents and Shawn about what happened to them.
By then Tara had built a happy life for herself in England, and was working on a PhD in history at Cambridge. However, the attempt to speak the truth quickly became a source of conflict in the family. Tara became more and more ostracized within her family, eventually culminating in Shawn learning that she had been telling their parents about the abuse she suffered. Realizing her family would never trust her claims, Tara became estranged from most of them, with the exception of Tyler.  The estrangement from her family prompted grief and depression for Tara, but she was finally able to heal, and successfully completed her PhD. By the end of her memoir, Tara has accepted that she may never have a relationship with her family again, but she takes pride in the independence she has established, and the life she has built for herself."
Khe,"The protagonist, who is named Tim O’Brien, begins by describing an event that occurred in the middle of his Vietnam experience. “The Things They Carried” catalogs the variety of things his fellow soldiers in the Alpha Company brought on their missions. Several of these things are intangible, including guilt and fear, while others are specific physical objects, including matches, morphine, M-16 rifles, and M&M’s candy.
Throughout the collection, the same characters reappear in various stories. The first member of the Alpha Company to die is Ted Lavender, a “grunt,” or low-ranking soldier, who deals with his anxiety about the war by taking tranquilizers and smoking marijuana. Lavender is shot in the head on his way back from going to the bathroom, and his superior, Lieutenant Jimmy Cross, blames himself for the tragedy. When Lavender is shot, Cross is distracting himself with thoughts of Martha, a college crush. It is revealed in “Love” that Cross’s feelings for Martha, whom he dated once before leaving for Vietnam, were never reciprocated, and that even twenty years after the war, his guilt over Lavender’s death remains.
In “On the Rainy River,” the narrator, O’Brien, explains the series of events that led him to Vietnam in the first place. He receives his draft notice in June of 1968, and his feelings of confusion drive him north to the Canadian border, which he contemplates crossing so that he will not be forced to fight in a war in which he doesn’t believe. Sitting in a rowboat with the proprietor of the Tip Top Lodge, where he stays, O’Brien decides that his guilt about avoiding the war and fear of disappointing his family are more important than his political convictions. He soon leaves, going first back home to Worthington, Minnesota and later to Vietnam.
In addition to Ted Lavender, a few other members of the Alpha Company are killed during their mission overseas, including Curt Lemon, who is killed when he steps on a rigged mortar round. Though O’Brien is not close to Lemon, in “The Dentist,” he tells a story of how Lemon, who faints before a routine checkup with an army-issued dentist, tries to save face by insisting that a perfectly good tooth be pulled. Lee Strunk, another member of the company, dies from injuries he sustains by stepping on a landmine. In “Friends,” O’Brien remembers that before Strunk was fatally hurt, Strunk and Dave Jensen had made a pact that if either man were irreparably harmed, the other man would see that he was quickly killed. However, when Strunk is actually hurt, he begs Jensen to spare him, and Jensen complies. Instead of being upset by the news of his friend’s swift death en route to treatment, Jensen is relieved.
The death that receives the most attention in The Things They Carried is that of Kiowa, a much-loved member of the Alpha Company and one of O’Brien’s closest friends. In “Speaking of Courage,” the story of Kiowa’s death is relayed in retrospect through the memory of Norman Bowker, years after the war. As Bowker drives around a lake in his Iowa hometown, he thinks that he failed to save Kiowa, who was killed when a mortar round hit and caused him to sink headfirst into a marshy field. O’Brien realizes that he has dealt with his guilt over Kiowa’s death differently than Norman Bowker in “Notes.” Just before the end of the war, O’Brien receives a long letter from Bowker that says he hasn’t found a way to make life meaningful after the war. O’Brien resolves to tell Bowker’s story, and the story of Kiowa’s death, in order to negotiate his own feelings of guilt and hollowness.
Like “Love” and “Notes,” several of O’Brien’s stories are told from a perspective twenty years after the Vietnam War, when he is a forty-three-year-old writer living in Massachusetts. Exposure to the guilt of old friends like Jimmy Cross and Norman Bowker prompts him to write stories in order to understand what they were going through. But two stories, “The Man I Killed” and “Ambush,” are written so that O’Brien can confront his own guilt over killing a man with a grenade outside the village of My Khe. In “The Man I Killed,” O’Brien imagines the life of his victim, from his childhood to the way things would have turned out for him had O’Brien not spotted him on a path and thrown a grenade at his feet. In “Ambush,” O’Brien imagines how he might relay the story of the man he killed to his nine-year-old daughter, Kathleen. In this second story, O’Brien provides more details of the actual killing—including the sound of the grenade and his own feelings—and explains that even well after the fact, he hasn’t finished sorting out the experience.
In the last story, “The Lives of the Dead,” O’Brien gives another twist to his contention that stories have the power to save people. In the stories of Curt Lemon and Kiowa, O’Brien explains that his imagination allowed him to grapple successfully with his guilt and confusion over the death of his fourth-grade first love, Linda."
Burthen,"The full title of Swift's pamphlet is ""A Modest Proposal for Preventing the Children of Poor People from Being a Burthen to their Parents, or the Country, and for Making them Beneficial to the Publick."" The tract is an ironically conceived attempt to ""find out a fair, cheap, and easy Method"" for converting the starving children of Ireland into ""sound and useful members of the Commonwealth."" Across the country poor children, predominantly Catholics, are living in squalor because their families are too poor to keep them fed and clothed.
The author argues, by hard-edged economic reasoning as well as from a self-righteous moral stance, for a way to turn this problem into its own solution. His proposal, in effect, is to fatten up these undernourished children and feed them to Ireland's rich land-owners. Children of the poor could be sold into a meat market at the age of one, he argues, thus combating overpopulation and unemployment, sparing families the expense of child-bearing while providing them with a little extra income, improving the culinary experience of the wealthy, and contributing to the overall economic well-being of the nation.
The author offers statistical support for his assertions and gives specific data about the number of children to be sold, their weight and price, and the projected consumption patterns. He suggests some recipes for preparing this delicious new meat, and he feels sure that innovative cooks will be quick to generate more. He also anticipates that the practice of selling and eating children will have positive effects on family morality: husbands will treat their wives with more respect, and parents will value their children in ways hitherto unknown. His conclusion is that the implementation of this project will do more to solve Ireland's complex social, political, and economic problems than any other measure that has been proposed."
Test,"In the Puritan New England town of Salem, Massachusetts, a group of girls goes dancing in the forest with a black slave named Tituba. While dancing, they are caught by the local minister, Reverend Parris. One of the girls, Parris’s daughter Betty, falls into a coma-like state. A crowd gathers in the Parris home while rumors of witchcraft fill the town. Having sent for Reverend Hale, an expert on witchcraft, Parris questions Abigail Williams, the girls’ ringleader, about the events that took place in the forest. Abigail, who is Parris’s niece and ward, admits to doing nothing beyond “dancing.”
While Parris tries to calm the crowd that has gathered in his home, Abigail talks to some of the other girls, telling them not to admit to anything. John Proctor, a local farmer, then enters and talks to Abigail alone. Unbeknownst to anyone else in the town, while working in Proctor’s home the previous year she engaged in an affair with him, which led to her being fired by his wife, Elizabeth. Abigail still desires Proctor, but he fends her off and tells her to end her foolishness with the girls.
Betty wakes up and begins screaming. Much of the crowd rushes upstairs and gathers in her bedroom, arguing over whether she is bewitched. A separate argument between Proctor, Parris, the argumentative Giles Corey, and the wealthy Thomas Putnam soon ensues. This dispute centers on money and land deeds, and it suggests that deep fault lines run through the Salem community. As the men argue, Reverend Hale arrives and examines Betty, while Proctor departs. Hale quizzes Abigail about the girls’ activities in the forest, grows suspicious of her behavior, and demands to speak to Tituba. After Parris and Hale interrogate her for a brief time, Tituba confesses to communing with the devil, and she hysterically accuses various townsfolk of consorting with the devil. Suddenly, Abigail joins her, confessing to having seen the devil conspiring and cavorting with other townspeople. Betty joins them in naming witches, and the crowd is thrown into an uproar.
A week later, alone in their farmhouse outside of town, John and Elizabeth Proctor discuss the ongoing trials and the escalating number of townsfolk who have been accused of being witches. Elizabeth urges her husband to denounce Abigail as a fraud; he refuses, and she becomes jealous, accusing him of still harboring feelings for her. Mary Warren, their servant and one of Abigail’s circle, returns from Salem with news that Elizabeth has been accused of witchcraft but the court did not pursue the accusation. Mary is sent up to bed, and John and Elizabeth continue their argument, only to be interrupted by a visit from Reverend Hale. While they discuss matters, Giles Corey and Francis Nurse come to the Proctor home with news that their wives have been arrested. Officers of the court suddenly arrive and arrest Elizabeth. After they have taken her, Proctor browbeats Mary, insisting that she must go to Salem and expose Abigail and the other girls as frauds.
The next day, Proctor brings Mary to court and tells Judge Danforth that she will testify that the girls are lying. Danforth is suspicious of Proctor’s motives and tells Proctor, truthfully, that Elizabeth is pregnant and will be spared for a time. Proctor persists in his charge, convincing Danforth to allow Mary to testify. Mary tells the court that the girls are lying. When the girls are brought in, they turn the tables by accusing Mary of bewitching them. Furious, Proctor confesses his affair with Abigail and accuses her of being motivated by jealousy of his wife. To test Proctor’s claim, Danforth summons Elizabeth and asks her if Proctor has been unfaithful to her. Despite her natural honesty, she lies to protect Proctor’s honor, and Danforth denounces Proctor as a liar. Meanwhile, Abigail and the girls again pretend that Mary is bewitching them, and Mary breaks down and accuses Proctor of being a witch. Proctor rages against her and against the court. He is arrested, and Hale quits the proceedings.
The summer passes and autumn arrives. The witch trials have caused unrest in neighboring towns, and Danforth grows nervous. Abigail has run away, taking all of Parris’s money with her. Hale, who has lost faith in the court, begs the accused witches to confess falsely in order to save their lives, but they refuse. Danforth, however, has an idea: he asks Elizabeth to talk John into confessing, and she agrees. Conflicted, but desiring to live, John agrees to confess, and the officers of the court rejoice. But he refuses to incriminate anyone else, and when the court insists that the confession must be made public, Proctor grows angry, tears it up, and retracts his admission of guilt. Despite Hale’s desperate pleas, Proctor goes to the gallows with the others, and the witch trials reach their awful conclusion."

Incredible,"Oskar Schell, a nine-year-old boy, has not been happy since his dad died in the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Unbeknownst to anyone except for Oskar, on the day of the attacks, Oskar’s dad called the house five times. Oskar was home for the fifth call but couldn’t bring himself to pick up the phone. They never recovered his dad’s body and buried an empty casket at his funeral. Oskar is furious that his mom has started to spend time with a man named Ron and worries that she has begun to move on. Oskar suffers from extreme anxiety and imagines whimsical inventions in order to cope. One night, he decides to look through his dad’s closet and sees a vase hidden on the top shelf. In trying to retrieve it, Oskar drops the vase, and when it shatters, he finds an envelope labeled “Black” that contains a strange key. After doing some research, Oskar decides to visit every person with the last name Black in New York City to try and discover what the key opens.
There is also a parallel storyline about Oskar’s grandparents. The novel includes letters from Oskar’s grandpa, Thomas, to his dad, and letters that his grandma writes to him. Thomas stops speaking not long after immigrating to America out of grief for Anna, his lost love who died in the bombing of Dresden. Thomas communicates by writing one-line sentences in notebooks. He explains that Grandma, Anna’s sister whose name we never learn, encountered him in a bakery and asked him to marry her. Grandma writes her own version of their meeting, which doesn’t quite match up with Thomas’s account. According to Grandma, when she reunited with Thomas, he asked her to pose for a sculpture. She agreed and started going to his apartment daily to pose. Although he started touching her for longer and longer in order to get her into the position he wanted, the sculpture still looked like Anna. Eventually, they had sex, and Grandma proposed. Throughout their marriage, they divide up their apartment into “Nothing” places, where they can go to not exist, and “Something” places. However, the lines blur. After Grandma becomes pregnant, Thomas leaves for Dresden because he doesn’t want to keep living any longer.
Early in Oskar’s search for the key, he meets Abby Black, an epidemiologist who lives in Greenwich Village. Throughout their conversation, he hears a man yelling from the next room, but Abby ignores him. Abby claims to know nothing about the key, but Oskar notices she seems to hold something back. Nevertheless, his search continues alphabetically down his list of people named Black. He eventually meets a man only referred to as Mr. Black, who lives in the apartment right above Oskar’s. Mr. Black is 103 years old, very wise, and hard of hearing. Oskar invites him to join him in the quest for the key, but Mr. Black hasn’t left the house in the twenty-three years since his wife’s death, and he’s turned off his hearing aids. He allows Oskar to turn his hearing aids back on. From then on, Mr. Black accompanies Oskar on his travels through the city, encouraging Oskar to get over his fear of public transportation. After they meet with Ruth Black, who lives in the Empire State Building, Mr. Black tells Oskar he’s done searching for the lock. Oskar is devastated.
Thomas returns to New York after 9/11 with a desire to try and live again. Grandma at first wants him neither to stay nor leave, but she eventually allows him to stay in the guestroom. She makes him promise never to let Oskar know he’s there. After Thomas sees Oskar for the first time, he starts following him around from a distance. Mr. Black eventually confronts Thomas and tries to protect Oskar. When Thomas explains who he is, Mr. Black tells him that he should be the one going around with Oskar. Not long after, Oskar finds Thomas in Grandma’s apartment and assumes him to be Grandma’s mysterious renter. Oskar tells Thomas the story of the key and plays him the messages his dad left on the answering machine. Thomas tells Oskar if he ever needs him to toss stones at his window. Oskar later asks Thomas to help him dig up his dad’s grave. Thomas agrees, and they bury Thomas’s unsent letters to his son in the grave. Afterward, Thomas tries to leave Grandma again, but she follows him to the airport. He doesn’t want to stay or leave, so they stay there, writing.
Not long after Oskar meets Thomas, he notices that there has been a single message on his family’s answering machine for months. He listens to it and discovers that Abby Black called him because she had information about the key. He returns to her house and learns that the key belongs to her ex-husband, William. Furthermore, Oskar’s mom knew about Oskar’s key quest all along and had called Abby Black, along with many of the other Blacks, to tell them Oskar was going to be coming. Confused and frustrated, Oskar goes to William's office. William explains that the key unlocks a safety deposit box that William’s deceased father left for him. William didn’t realize the key was in the vase until after he’d sold the vase to Oskar’s dad at an estate sale. Disappointed that the key had nothing to do with his dad, Oskar goes home. He formulates a plan to dig up his dad’s grave. He looks at a series of photographs he has of a man falling from the World Trade Center. He reorders the photographs so that the man floats back up and imagines his last night with his dad playing out in reverse."
Ridge,"Rebecca's narrative takes the form of a flashback. The heroine, who remains nameless, lives in Europe with her husband, Maxim de Winter, traveling from hotel to hotel, harboring memories of a beautiful home called Manderley, which, we learn, has been destroyed by fire. The story begins with her memories of how she and Maxim first met, in Monte Carlo, years before.
In her flashback, the heroine is working as the young traveling companion to a wealthy American named Mrs. Van Hopper. In her flashback, Maxim is staying at the same hotel as the heroine and her employer, and after knowing the heroine for only a few weeks, he proposes marriage. She accepts, and he marries her and takes her back to his ancestral estate of Manderley. But a dark cloud hangs over their marriage: Maxim's first wife, Rebecca, drowned in a cove near Manderley the previous year, and her ghost haunts the newlyweds' home. Rebecca's devoted housekeeper, the sinister Mrs. Danvers, is still in charge of Manderley, and she frightens and intimidates her new mistress. Despite the encouragement of the house overseer, Frank Crawley, and Maxim's sister, Beatrice, the heroine struggles in her new life at Manderley. She feels that she can never compare favorably to Rebecca, who was beautiful, talented, and brilliant--or so everyone says--and soon she feels that Maxim is still in love with his dead wife.
Manderley traditionally hosts a costume ball each year, and it is soon time for the gala to take place. Swept up in the preparations, the heroine's spirits begin to revive. But the ball ends in disaster: on Mrs. Danvers's suggestion she wears a costume that, it turns out, is the same dress that Rebecca wore at the last ball. Upon seeing the heroine, Maxim is horrified, and the heroine becomes convinced that he will never love her, that he is still devoted to Rebecca. The following day, Mrs. Danvers almost convinces her to kill herself, and she only breaks away from the old woman's spell when rockets go off over the cove, signaling that a ship has run aground. When divers swim near the grounded ship, they find the wreckage of Rebecca's sailboat, with Rebecca's dead body in the hold. This discovery prompts Maxim to tell the heroine the truth: Rebecca was a malevolent, wicked woman, who lived a secret life and carried on multiple affairs, including one with her cousin, Jack Favell. On the night of her death, Maxim had demanded a divorce, and she had refused, and told him that she was pregnant with Favell's child. Furious, he seized a gun and shot her, and then sailed out to the harbor in Rebecca's boat and sank it, with the body stowed safely inside.
This revelation restores the heroine's marriage, and enables her to finally shake off the burden of Rebecca's ghost. Meanwhile, however, the noose of justice tightens around Maxim: first, it is found that holes have been drilled in the bottom of Rebecca's boat; luckily the coroner delivers a report of suicide, rather than murder. But soon Rebecca's cousin Favell, certain that Rebecca did not kill herself, accuses Maxim of the crime. The local magistrate, Colonel Julyan, investigates, and finds that on the day of her death, Rebecca went up to London to see a Doctor Baker. Favell, Maxim, and the heroine accompany Julyan to London; the heroine is certain that Baker will reveal that Rebecca was pregnant, thus revealing Maxim's vengeful motive for murder. But instead, it turns out that Rebecca was dying of cancer, and that furthermore she was infertile; she had lied to Maxim about her pregnancy. Her terminal illness now supplies a motive for Rebecca's supposed suicide, and Maxim is saved. He and the heroine drive all night back to Manderley, stopping only once, when Maxim calls home and learns that Mrs. Danvers has disappeared. As they crest the ridge near the mansion, they look down and find it in flames."
Speech,"Speak, by Laurie Halse Anderson, chronicles the struggles of thirteen-year-old Melinda Sordino after she is a raped by at a party the summer before her freshman year of high school by another student. Melinda tells her story in first person narrative. She describes events within the framework of the four marking periods of the school year.
In the opening part of Speak, “First Marking Period,” Melinda begins high school, and we learn that former friends now hate her. She experiences humiliation in the cafeteria and Mr. Neck, a social studies teacher, further embarrasses her by giving her demerits on the first day of school. Ostracized by her former friends, she befriends Heather, a new girl at the school. Heather seeks popularity, and she badgers Melinda to join various clubs. Rachel, Melinda’s ex-best friend, hasn’t tried to find out the truth about what really happened to Melinda that night at the party over the summer.
Melinda describes her classes, activities, and thoughts. Her project in Mr. Freeman’s art class is to create a work of art based on a “tree,” which is the object named on the piece of paper she randomly chooses. In biology, Melinda thinks that David Petrakis, her lab partner, might be cute without the braces. And in algebra, when Mr. Stetman has Rachel come to the board to help Melinda with a problem, Melinda is humiliated. 
Melinda often skips class using stolen late passes and doesn’t complete her homework. She finds refuge at school in a vacant janitor’s closet, which she turns into her “burrow.” At the Homecoming Rally, students bully her for being the one who called the cops that night at the party.
At home, Melinda and her parents communicate with each other by leaving notes on the refrigerator. In her bedroom, she no longer wants to look in the mirror and puts it in the back of her closet. Toward the end of the marking period, Melinda’s parents hear from the school about her missing work, and she remains silent while they berate her for failing. Through it all, Melinda sees “IT” everywhere, the nightmare from which she cannot awaken.
In “Second Marking Period,” school is a grind for Melinda. At her parents’ insistence, she stays after to finish her homework, but she goes to her burrow and naps instead. In social studies, David Petrakis stands up against Mr. Neck’s racist rant about immigration. In biology, she finds that a seed within the apple she has cut is already growing. Heather gives her an early Christmas present, and Melinda decides she’ll give Heather a friendship necklace. 
On Christmas, Melinda nearly tells her parents what happened that night last summer but can’t. Winter break is miserable. Her parents keep her busy working for them, and she is relieved when school starts again. 
In gym class, Melinda impresses the basketball coaches with skills but has no interest in being on the team. She reluctantly helps Heather in her attempts to become an initiated member of a do-good club. And in biology, when she and David dissect a frog, she faints when preparing to slice it open. 
Melinda’s parents receive another call from the guidance counselor about her grades. After their verbal assault, Melinda goes to her room and uses an open paper clip to scrape at her wrist. 
“IT”, who we learn is Andy Evans, harasses Melinda in the cafeteria, and she runs to the bathroom to vomit. She has yet to tell anyone, even the reader, about what happened that summer night.
In “Third Marking Period,” Melinda continues to skip school and avoid Andy Evans. Heather ends their friendship suddenly, and later returns the friendship necklace Melinda had given her for Christmas. No one, Melinda is sure, “would like the inside girl I think I am.” 
The school counselors hold another meeting with Melinda’s parents, who berate and threaten her. She refuses to talk or defend herself. She receives In-School Suspension, and IT is there. He sits next to her and blows in her ear when Mr. Neck isn’t looking. 
In art class, Mr. Freeman gives Melinda a book about Picasso to help her “paralyzed” imagination. Picasso’s art inspires her, and she begins to draw. Mr. Freeman recognizes that she has a lot to say.
Melinda works to meet the expectations set for her. Yet, with “no friends in the known universe,” Melinda sits alone at lunch, wondering if everyone is talking and laughing about her. 
One afternoon, after a basketball game, David Petrakis invites her to his house for pizza to celebrate the team’s one-point win. She declines, torn between getting a life, and the fact that the world is a dangerous place.
At last, Melinda reveals that she was attacked at a party last summer, though she does not use the word “rape.” At this point, we (the readers) are the only ones besides Melinda who know what happened.
In “Fourth Marking Period,” Melinda takes her ex-friend Ivy’s advice and tries drawing a tree instead of carving one from linoleum block. She also learns that Rachel is dating Andy Evans. Compelled to do something, she writes a note to Rachel warning her about Andy. In the note, she admits for the first time (but without divulging her identity), that she was raped. 
Springtime arrives, and Melinda finds solace working in the garden. She and David plan a protest in social studies class over an oral report she is supposed to present, and she stands up to Heather by refusing to help her decorate for the Senior Prom. She writes on a stall in the bathroom, “Guys to Stay Away From: Andy Evans.” Andy Evans continues to bully her. 
Melinda feels compelled to tell Rachel the truth about Andy and what happened that night. But, when Rachel learns that Andy Evans was Melinda’s attacker, she accuses Melinda of being jealous and calls her a “twisted little freak.” Later, Ivy brings Melinda into the bathroom stall. Other girls have added words like “creep” and “bastard” under Andy Evan’s name. Seeing that, Melinda feels like she can fly.
Melinda realizes she doesn’t need her burrow anymore. When she is clearing her items out of the closet, Andy Evans barges in, attacks Melinda, and tries to rape her again. She finds her voice and screams “NNNOOO!!” He does not back off, so Melinda breaks a mirror, takes a shard of glass, and holds it to his neck. “I said no,” she tells him. People who had heard her scream run for help.
With hours left in the school year, Melinda finds herself a sort of hero. She finishes her tree project, receiving an A+ from Mr. Freeman."
Reconsider,"Jack Worthing, the play’s protagonist, is a pillar of the community in Hertfordshire, where he is guardian to Cecily Cardew, the pretty, eighteen-year-old granddaughter of the late Thomas Cardew, who found and adopted Jack when he was a baby. In Hertfordshire, Jack has responsibilities: he is a major landowner and justice of the peace, with tenants, farmers, and a number of servants and other employees all dependent on him. For years, he has also pretended to have an irresponsible black-sheep brother named Ernest who leads a scandalous life in pursuit of pleasure and is always getting into trouble of a sort that requires Jack to rush grimly off to his assistance. In fact, Ernest is merely Jack’s alibi, a phantom that allows him to disappear for days at a time and do as he likes. No one but Jack knows that he himself is Ernest. Ernest is the name Jack goes by in London, which is where he really goes on these occasions—probably to pursue the very sort of behavior he pretends to disapprove of in his imaginary brother.
Jack is in love with Gwendolen Fairfax, the cousin of his best friend, Algernon Moncrieff. When the play opens, Algernon, who knows Jack as Ernest, has begun to suspect something, having found an inscription inside Jack’s cigarette case addressed to “Uncle Jack” from someone who refers to herself as “little Cecily.” Algernon suspects that Jack may be leading a double life, a practice he seems to regard as commonplace and indispensable to modern life. He calls a person who leads a double life a “Bunburyist,” after a nonexistent friend he pretends to have, a chronic invalid named Bunbury, to whose deathbed he is forever being summoned whenever he wants to get out of some tiresome social obligation.
At the beginning of Act 1, Jack drops in unexpectedly on Algernon and announces that he intends to propose to Gwendolen. Algernon confronts him with the cigarette case and forces him to come clean, demanding to know who “Jack” and “Cecily” are. Jack confesses that his name isn’t really Ernest and that Cecily is his ward, a responsibility imposed on him by his adoptive father’s will. Jack also tells Algernon about his fictional brother. Jack says he’s been thinking of killing off this fake brother, since Cecily has been showing too active an interest in him. Without meaning to, Jack describes Cecily in terms that catch Algernon’s attention and make him even more interested in her than he is already.
Gwendolen and her mother, Lady Bracknell, arrive, which gives Jack an opportunity to propose to Gwendolen. Jack is delighted to discover that Gwendolen returns his affections, but he is alarmed to learn that Gwendolen is fixated on the name Ernest, which she says “inspires absolute confidence.” Gwendolen makes clear that she would not consider marrying a man who was not named Ernest.
Lady Bracknell interviews Jack to determine his eligibility as a possible son-in-law, and during this interview she asks about his family background. When Jack explains that he has no idea who his parents were and that he was found, by the man who adopted him, in a handbag in the cloakroom at Victoria Station, Lady Bracknell is scandalized. She forbids the match between Jack and Gwendolen and sweeps out of the house.
In Act 2, Algernon shows up at Jack’s country estate posing as Jack’s brother Ernest. Meanwhile, Jack, having decided that Ernest has outlived his usefulness, arrives home in deep mourning, full of a story about Ernest having died suddenly in Paris. He is enraged to find Algernon there masquerading as Ernest but has to go along with the charade. If he doesn’t, his own lies and deceptions will be revealed.
While Jack changes out of his mourning clothes, Algernon, who has fallen hopelessly in love with Cecily, asks her to marry him. He is surprised to discover that Cecily already considers that they are engaged, and he is charmed when she reveals that her fascination with “Uncle Jack’s brother” led her to invent an elaborate romance between herself and him several months ago. Algernon is less enchanted to learn that part of Cecily’s interest in him derives from the name Ernest, which, unconsciously echoing Gwendolen, she says “inspires absolute confidence.”
Algernon goes off in search of Dr. Chasuble, the local rector, to see about getting himself christened Ernest. Meanwhile, Gwendolen arrives, having decided to pay Jack an unexpected visit. Gwendolen is shown into the garden, where Cecily orders tea and attempts to play hostess. Cecily has no idea how Gwendolen figures into Jack’s life, and Gwendolen, for her part, has no idea who Cecily is. Gwendolen initially thinks Cecily is a visitor to the Manor House and is disconcerted to learn that Cecily is “Mr. Worthing’s ward.” She notes that Ernest has never mentioned having a ward, and Cecily explains that it is not Ernest Worthing who is her guardian but his brother Jack and, in fact, that she is engaged to be married to Ernest Worthing. Gwendolen points out that this is impossible as she herself is engaged to Ernest Worthing. The tea party degenerates into a war of manners.
Jack and Algernon arrive toward the climax of this confrontation, each having separately made arrangements with Dr. Chasuble to be christened Ernest later that day. Each of the young ladies points out that the other has been deceived: Cecily informs Gwendolen that her fiancé is really named Jack and Gwendolen informs Cecily that hers is really called Algernon. The two women demand to know where Jack’s brother Ernest is, since both of them are engaged to be married to him. Jack is forced to admit that he has no brother and that Ernest is a complete fiction. Both women are shocked and furious, and they retire to the house arm in arm.
Act 3 takes place in the drawing room of the Manor House, where Cecily and Gwendolen have retired. When Jack and Algernon enter from the garden, the two women confront them. Cecily asks Algernon why he pretended to be her guardian’s brother. Algernon tells her he did it in order to meet her. Gwendolen asks Jack whether he pretended to have a brother in order to come into London to see her as often as possible, and she interprets his evasive reply as an affirmation. The women are somewhat appeased but still concerned over the issue of the name. However, when Jack and Algernon tell Gwendolen and Cecily that they have both made arrangements to be christened Ernest that afternoon, all is forgiven and the two pairs of lovers embrace. At this moment, Lady Bracknell’s arrival is announced.
Lady Bracknell has followed Gwendolen from London, having bribed Gwendolen’s maid to reveal her destination. She demands to know what is going on. Gwendolen again informs Lady Bracknell of her engagement to Jack, and Lady Bracknell reiterates that a union between them is out of the question. Algernon tells Lady Bracknell of his engagement to Cecily, prompting her to inspect Cecily and inquire into her social connections, which she does in a routine and patronizing manner that infuriates Jack. He replies to all her questions with a mixture of civility and sarcasm, withholding until the last possible moment the information that Cecily is actually worth a great deal of money and stands to inherit still more when she comes of age. At this, Lady Bracknell becomes genuinely interested.
Jack informs Lady Bracknell that, as Cecily’s legal guardian, he refuses to give his consent to her union with Algernon. Lady Bracknell suggests that the two young people simply wait until Cecily comes of age, and Jack points out that under the terms of her grandfather’s will, Cecily does not legally come of age until she is thirty-five. Lady Bracknell asks Jack to reconsider, and he points out that the matter is entirely in her own hands. As soon as she consents to his marriage to Gwendolen, Cecily can have his consent to marry Algernon. However, Lady Bracknell refuses to entertain the notion. She and Gwendolen are on the point of leaving when Dr. Chasuble arrives and happens to mention Cecily’s governess, Miss Prism. At this, Lady Bracknell starts and asks that Miss Prism be sent for.
When the governess arrives and catches sight of Lady Bracknell, she begins to look guilty and furtive. Lady Bracknell accuses her of having left her sister’s house twenty-eight years before with a baby and never returned. She demands to know where the baby is. Miss Prism confesses she doesn’t know, explaining that she lost the baby, having absentmindedly placed it in a handbag in which she had meant to place the manuscript for a novel she had written. Jack asks what happened to the bag, and Miss Prism says she left it in the cloakroom of a railway station. Jack presses her for further details and goes racing offstage, returning a few moments later with a large handbag. When Miss Prism confirms that the bag is hers, Jack throws himself on her with a cry of “Mother!” It takes a while before the situation is sorted out, but before too long we understand that Jack is not the illegitimate child of Miss Prism but the legitimate child of Lady Bracknell’s sister and, therefore, Algernon’s older brother. Furthermore, Jack had been originally christened “Ernest John.” All these years Jack has unwittingly been telling the truth: Ernest is his name, as is Jack, and he does have an unprincipled younger brother—Algernon. Again the couples embrace, Miss Prism and Dr. Chasuble follow suit, and Jack acknowledges that he now understands “the vital Importance of Being Earnest.”"
Dangers,"In a pair of sumptuous drawingrooms, one in a Parisian mansion, the other in a chateau on a luxurious estate in the countryside surrounding Paris, two aristocrats are very bored. The Marquise de Merteuil decides, therefore, to construct a little intrigue for her own amusement and the amusement of her former lover, the Vicomte de Valmont. The Marquise is aware that a young girl of good family, Cécile Volanges, has only just left the convent so that she can be married to the Comte de Gercourt. Now, the Marquise has a bone to pick with this particular Comte, and so she suggests to the Vicomte that he seduce and debauch Cécile to create a scandal and humiliate Gercourt. Valmont accepts the Marquise's proposal somewhat coolly, since he already has his eyes on another prey, the highly religious Présidente de Tourvel, the chaste wife of a member of Parliament. But, never one to refuse a challenge, Valmont suggests that he and the Marquise enter into a slightly different bet: if he can obtain written proof that he has slept with the Présidente, the Marquise must yield herself to him.
Meanwhile, Cécile has been presented to society, and in society she meets the charming and gentle Chevalier Danceny. Danceny becomes Cécile's music teacher and slowly, with a little coaxing from the Marquise de Merteuil, the two young people fall in love. During this time, Valmont is out in the country on his aunt's estate, trying to turn the Présidente de Tourvel's head. He has very little luck in this department despite his use of every known trick in the book. Then, as coincidence would have, Cécile's mother, Madame Volanges, who corresponds regularly with the Présidente de Tourvel, happens to say some rather unflattering things about Valmont in a letter which Valmont just happens to steal and read. And thus it is that Valmont resolves to seduce the little Volanges as revenge for her mother's only too accurate trash-talk.
Cécile's ""seduction"" would be more accurately termed ""rape,"" but the girl is persuaded to enter into a bizarre student-teacher relationship with Valmont, so that for a while she is being courted by Danceny and ""loved"" nightly by Valmont. During his time as Cécile's teacher, Valmont is also able to win the heart of the Présidente de Tourvel.
However, the Marquise de Merteuil is not so easily pleased. Rather than encourage the Vicomte de Valmont to meet the conditions of their original agreement, she mocks him for having fallen in love with the Présidente de Tourvel. Valmont's pride does not withstand these attacks very well, and to avoid compromising his reputation as a good-for-nothing gigolo, he leaves the Présidente cold, with no explanation. Cécile fares no better, after a particularly rough night in Valmont's room, she miscarries his child.
Now things are really looking bad for everyone involved. The Présidente de Tourvel removes herself to a convent where she proceeds to die of grief and shame. Merteuil and Valmont are never able to reconcile their little snit and can only agree to go to war with one another. Danceny learns that Valmont seduced Cécile and challenges him to a duel; and Danceny wins the duel. Valmont hands over his correspondence with the Marquise to Danceny on his deathbed; all of society learns of her schemes and machinations. The Marquise is forced to flee town and, like a wicked old witch, is never heard from again. Full of regret for her activities with Valmont, Cécile returns to the convent from whence she came, with the intention of becoming a nun."
Partial,"The Joy Luck Club contains sixteen interwoven stories about conflicts between Chinese immigrant mothers and their American-raised daughters. The book hinges on Jing-mei’s trip to China to meet her half-sisters, twins Chwun Yu and Chwun Hwa. The half-sisters remained behind in China because Jing-mei’s mother, Suyuan, was forced to leave them on the roadside during her desperate flight from Japan’s invasion of Kweilin during World War II. Jing-mei was born to a different father years later, in America. Suyuan intended to return to China for her other daughters, but failed to find them before her death.
Jing-mei has taken her mother’s place playing mahjong in a weekly gathering her mother had organized in China and revived in San Francisco: the Joy Luck Club. The club’s other members—Lindo, Ying-ying, and An-mei—are three of her mother’s oldest friends and fellow immigrants. They tell Jing-mei that just before Suyuan died, she had finally succeeded in locating the address of her lost daughters. The three women repeatedly urge Jing-mei to travel to China and tell her sisters about their mother’s life. But Jing-mei wonders whether she is capable of telling her mother’s story, and the three older women fear that Jing-mei’s doubts may be justified. They fear that their own daughters, like Jing-mei, may not know or appreciate the stories of their mothers’ lives.
The novel is composed of four sections, each of which contains four separate narratives. In the first four stories of the book, the mothers, speaking in turn, recall with astonishing clarity their relationships with their own mothers, and they worry that their daughters’ recollections of them will never possess the same intensity. In the second section, these daughters—Waverly, Jing-mei, Lena, and Rose—relate their recollections of their childhood relationships with their mothers; the great lucidity and force with which they tell their stories proves their mothers’ fears at least partially unfounded. In the third group of stories, the four daughters narrate their adult dilemmas—troubles in marriage and with their careers. Although they believe that their mothers’ antiquated ideas do not pertain to their own very American lifestyles, their search for solutions inevitably brings them back to their relationships with the older generation. In the final group of stories, the mothers struggle to offer solutions and support to their daughters, in the process learning more about themselves. Lindo recognizes through her daughter Waverly that she has been irrevocably changed by American culture. Ying-ying realizes that Lena has unwittingly followed her passive example in her marriage to Harold Livotny. An-mei realizes that Rose has not completely understood the lessons she intended to teach her about faith and hope.
Although Jing-mei fears that she cannot adequately portray her mother’s life, Suyuan’s story permeates the novel via Jing-mei’s voice: she speaks for Suyuan in the first and fourth sections, the two “mothers’ sections,” of the novel. Suyuan’s story is representative of the struggle to maintain the mother-daughter bond across cultural and generational gaps; by telling this story as her mother’s daughter, Jing-mei enacts and cements the very bond that is the subject of Suyuan’s story. When Jing-mei finally travels to China and helps her half-sisters to know a mother they cannot remember, she forges two other mother-daughter bonds as well. Her journey represents a reconciliation between Suyuan’s two lives, between two cultures, and between mother and daughter. This enables Jing-mei to bring closure and resolution to her mother’s story, but also to her own. In addition, the journey brings hope to the other members of the Joy Luck Club that they too can reconcile the oppositions in their lives between past and present, between cultures, and between generations."
Followed,"In the novel’s foreword, the fictional John Ray, Jr., Ph.D., explains the strange story that will follow. According to Ray, he received the manuscript, entitled Lolita, or the 	Confession of a White Widowed Male, from the author’s lawyer. The author himself, known by the pseudonym of Humbert Humbert (or H. H.), died in jail of coronary thrombosis while awaiting a trial. Ray asserts that while the author’s actions are despicable, his writing remains beautiful and persuasive. He also indicates that the novel will become a favorite in psychiatric circles as well as encourage parents to raise better children in a better world. 
In the manuscript, Humbert relates his peaceful upbringing on the Riviera, where he encounters his first love, the twelve-year-old Annabel Leigh. Annabel and the thirteen-year-old Humbert never consummate their love, and Annabel’s death from typhus four months later haunts Humbert. Although Humbert goes on to a career as a teacher of English literature, he spends time in a mental institution and works a succession of odd jobs. Despite his marriage to an adult woman, which eventually fails, Humbert remains obsessed with sexually desirable and sexually aware young girls. These nymphets, as he calls them, remind him of Annabel, though he fails to find another like her. Eventually, Humbert comes to the United States and takes a room in the house of widow Charlotte Haze in a sleepy, suburban New England town. He becomes instantly infatuated with her twelve-year-old daughter Dolores, also known as Lolita. Humbert follows Lolita’s moves constantly, occasionally flirts with her, and confides his pedophiliac longings to a journal. Meanwhile, Charlotte Haze, whom Humbert loathes, has fallen in love with him. When Charlotte sends Lolita off to summer camp, Humbert marries Charlotte in order to stay near his true love. Humbert wants to be alone with Lolita and even toys with the idea of killing Charlotte, but he can’t go through with it. However, Charlotte finds his diary and, after learning that he hates her but loves her daughter, confronts him. Humbert denies everything, but Charlotte tells him she is leaving him and storms out of the house. At that moment, a car hits her and she dies instantly. 
Humbert goes to the summer camp and picks up Lolita. Only when they arrive at a motel does he tell her that Charlotte has died. In his account of events, Humbert claims that Lolita seduces him, rather than the other way around. The two drive across the country for nearly a year, during which time Humbert becomes increasingly obsessed with Lolita and she learns to manipulate him. When she engages in tantrums or refuses his advances, Humbert threatens to put her in an orphanage. At the same time, a strange man seems to take an interest in Humbert and Lolita and appears to be following them in their travels.
Humbert eventually gets a job at Beardsley College somewhere in the Northeast, and Lolita enrolls in school. Her wish to socialize with boys her own age causes a strain in their relationship, and Humbert becomes more restrictive in his rules. Nonetheless, he allows her to appear in a school play. Lolita begins to behave secretively around Humbert, and he accuses her of being unfaithful and takes her away on another road trip. On the road, Humbert suspects that they are being followed. Lolita doesn’t notice anything, and Humbert accuses her of conspiring with their stalker. 
Lolita becomes ill, and Humbert must take her to the hospital. However, when Humbert returns to get her, the nurses tell him that her uncle has already picked her up. Humbert flies into a rage, but then he calms himself and leaves the hospital, heartbroken and angry.
For the next two years, Humbert searches for Lolita, unearthing clues about her kidnapper in order to exact his revenge. He halfheartedly takes up with a woman named Rita, but then he receives a note from Lolita, now married and pregnant, asking for money. Assuming that Lolita has married the man who had followed them on their travels, Humbert becomes determined to kill him. He finds Lolita, poor and pregnant at seventeen. Humbert realizes that Lolita’s husband is not the man who kidnapped her from the hospital. When pressed, Lolita admits that Clare Quilty, a playwright whose presence has been felt from the beginning of the book, had taken her from the hospital. Lolita loved Quilty, but he kicked her out when she refused to participate in a child pornography orgy. Still devoted to Lolita, Humbert begs her to return to him. Lolita gently refuses. Humbert gives her 4,000 dollars and then departs. He tracks down Quilty at his house and shoots him multiple times, killing him. Humbert is arrested and put in jail, where he continues to write his memoir, stipulating that it can only be published upon Lolita’s death. After Lolita dies in childbirth, Humbert dies of heart failure, and the manuscript is sent to John Ray, Jr., Ph.D."
Impair,"Guy Montag is a fireman who burns books in a futuristic American city. In Montag’s world, firemen start fires rather than putting them out. The people in this society do not read books, enjoy nature, spend time by themselves, think independently, or have meaningful conversations. Instead, they drive very fast, watch excessive amounts of television on wall-size sets, and listen to the radio on “Seashell Radio” sets attached to their ears.
Montag encounters a gentle seventeen-year-old girl named Clarisse McClellan, who opens his eyes to the emptiness of his life with her innocently penetrating questions and her unusual love of people and nature. Over the next few days, Montag experiences a series of disturbing events. First, his wife, Mildred, attempts suicide by swallowing a bottle of sleeping pills. Then, when he responds to an alarm that an old woman has a stash of hidden literature, the woman shocks him by choosing to be burned alive along with her books. A few days later, he hears that Clarisse has been killed by a speeding car. Montag’s dissatisfaction with his life increases, and he begins to search for a solution in a stash of books that he has stolen from his own fires and hidden inside an air-conditioning vent.
When Montag fails to show up for work, his fire chief, Beatty, pays a visit to his house. Beatty explains that it’s normal for a fireman to go through a phase of wondering what books have to offer, and he delivers a dizzying monologue explaining how books came to be banned in the first place. According to Beatty, special-interest groups and other “minorities” objected to books that offended them. Soon, books all began to look the same, as writers tried to avoid offending anybody. This was not enough, however, and society as a whole decided to simply burn books rather than permit conflicting opinions. Beatty tells Montag to take twenty-four hours or so to see if his stolen books contain anything worthwhile and then turn them in for incineration. Montag begins a long and frenzied night of reading.
Overwhelmed by the task of reading, Montag looks to his wife for help and support, but she prefers television to her husband’s company and cannot understand why he would want to take the terrible risk of reading books. He remembers that he once met a retired English professor named Faber sitting in a park, and he decides that this man might be able to help him understand what he reads. He visits Faber, who tells him that the value of books lies in the detailed awareness of life that they contain. Faber says that Montag needs not only books but also the leisure to read them and the freedom to act upon their ideas.
Faber agrees to help Montag with his reading, and they concoct a risky scheme to overthrow the status quo. Faber will contact a printer and begin reproducing books, and Montag will plant books in the homes of firemen to discredit the profession and to destroy the machinery of censorship. Faber gives him a two-way radio earpiece (the “green bullet”) so that he can hear what Montag hears and talk to him secretly.
Montag goes home, and soon two of his wife’s friends arrive to watch television. The women discuss their families and the war that is about to be declared in an extremely frivolous manner. Their superficiality angers him, and he takes out a book of poetry and reads “Dover Beach” by Matthew Arnold. Faber buzzes in his ear for him to be quiet, and Mildred tries to explain that the poetry reading is a standard way for firemen to demonstrate the uselessness of literature. The women are extremely disturbed by the poem and leave to file a complaint against Montag.
Montag goes to the fire station and hands over one of his books to Beatty. Beatty confuses Montag by barraging him with contradictory quotations from great books. Beatty exploits these contradictions to show that literature is morbid and dangerously complex, and that it deserves incineration. Suddenly, the alarm sounds, and they rush off to answer the call, only to find that the alarm is at Montag’s own house. Mildred gets into a cab with her suitcase, and Montag realizes that his own wife has betrayed him.
Beatty forces Montag to burn the house himself; when he is done, Beatty places him under arrest. When Beatty continues to berate Montag, Montag turns the flamethrower on his superior and proceeds to burn him to ashes. Montag knocks the other firemen unconscious and runs. The Mechanical Hound, a monstrous machine that Beatty has set to attack Montag, pounces and injects Montag’s leg with a large dose of anesthetic. Montag manages to destroy it with his flamethrower; then he walks off the numbness in his leg and escapes with some books that were hidden in his backyard. He hides these in another fireman’s house and calls in an alarm from a pay phone.
Montag goes to Faber’s house, where he learns that a new Hound has been put on his trail, along with several helicopters and a television crew. Faber tells Montag that he is leaving for St. Louis to see a retired printer who may be able to help them. Montag gives Faber some money and tells him how to remove Montag’s scent from his house so the Hound will not enter it. Montag then takes some of Faber’s old clothes and runs off toward the river. The whole city watches as the chase unfolds on TV, but Montag manages to escape in the river and change into Faber’s clothes to disguise his scent. He drifts downstream into the country and follows a set of abandoned railroad tracks until he finds a group of renegade intellectuals (“the Book People”), led by a man named Granger, who welcome him. They are a part of a nationwide network of book lovers who have memorized many great works of literature and philosophy. They hope that they may be of some help to mankind in the aftermath of the war that has just been declared. Montag’s role is to memorize the Book of Ecclesiastes. Enemy jets appear in the sky and completely obliterate the city with bombs. Montag and his new friends move on to search for survivors and rebuild civilization."

Races,"Oluo uses the introduction to establish herself as a Black woman who is both proud of her culture and constantly hindered by America’s racism and the social injustice that permeates its society. She is ready to demand change, as are many Black people in an internet age that allows the documentation and validation of their experiences. White people might find these conversations uncomfortable or even scary, but it is far past time for America to address white supremacy and its fundamental, systemic inequities. 
Social change cannot be made in America without considering race, because racial disparities permeate every aspect of society. American society, and especially the American economy, rest on the premise that people of color are born inferior to white people. Even Obama’s election only reaffirmed white America’s denial of racism while spurring white people on to demand more in comparison with their Black and brown counterparts. Racism is systemic, affecting every part of American life. Individual exceptions do not invalidate the overall, cumulative experience of social inequality and oppression. White people do not experience racism, so they need to listen to people of color and trust the validity of their experiences. 
Racism is not limited to the fear or hatred that a white person might feel toward a Black person. It’s the system of inequality perpetuated by the government, business, and education. Only this definition offers the hope of systemic change while demanding that majority individuals face their privilege, their racism, and their role in the fight. Because America is a racist society, white people are guaranteed to make mistakes when talking about it. That fact cannot become an excuse to stop trying, although good intentions are no longer sufficient. White people must apologize and learn to do better when they make hurtful comments. A good start is for everyone to understand the extent of their privilege. The exercise is not intended to inflict guilt but to force everyone to realize the ways in which their lived experiences are different than those of others. That understanding can help everyone demand change in the places where they exercise power.  
People’s identities are compilations of many factors. Intersectionality is a viewpoint that acknowledges all of these factors so people can be respected and valued for all of their identities, whether Black, mixed, male, female, feminist, scholar, artist, and so on. It’s a tough task because it slows social progress and demands empathy, but without it, any social progress only establishes a new hierarchy that then serves to oppress another group of people.  
The book’s central chapters address a variety of racial topics. Police in America treat Black people differently because of racism’s systemic nature. White people have trouble acknowledging this fact because doing so requires they admit the ways racism benefits them. Affirmative action is an admittedly flawed program that nevertheless benefits minorities and should be continued but also advanced. Teachers and school administrators see Black children as larger, older, more aggressive, and less intelligent than their white counterparts, so Black children are disciplined more often and more harshly, leading to their criminalization and institutionalization. The word “n*****” is intrinsically harmful, and even free speech does not justify its use. Also painful is the adoption of a culture’s customs (i.e., cultural appropriation), while benefiting financially from them, not acknowledging their historical development, and not having to share in the struggles that formed them. Touching a Black person’s hair continues America’s racist history of treating Black people’s bodies as white people’s property. It denies a Black person’s autonomy, agency, and right to personal space.  
In the final five chapters, Oluo addresses the painful effects of cumulative acts of systemic racism, beginning with microaggressions. These thoughtless or cruel comments and behaviors accumulate, resulting in psychological damage. Black people have the right to call out these comments and behaviors and to demand an apology. Oluo then discusses that despite the best efforts of previous generations, young Black people have inherited a deeply unjust America, and adults must trust them to carry the battle forward. Racism’s systemic nature is maintained in part by the argument that some Black people, such as Martin Luther King, Jr., are “good” activists who deserve social equality while others, such as Malcolm X, are not. The dichotomy is false; either every person is equal, or America is doomed to forever be a white supremacy. Finally, Oluo encourages her readers to move beyond talking about racism and to take actions to make society truly equal for all."
Constitutional,"Lawyer Bryan Stevenson gives a first-person account of his decades helping marginalized Americans who have been unfairly and harshly punished by the U.S. criminal justice system, which disproportionately targets people of color and poor people. At the heart of Just Mercy is the story of Walter McMillian, a Black man who was framed for the murder of a girl named Ronda Morrison, convicted, and sent to death row. 
Stevenson alternates chapters about Walter with his personal reflections on our country’s history with racial disparity and issues around incarceration. Stevenson highlights other groups of vulnerable people who have been victimized by the criminal justice system and shares the stories of the prisoners he has helped over the years. The book also follows the growth of Stevenson’s nonprofit law project, the Alabama-based Equal Justice Initiative (EJI), through its expansion from focusing on death row prisoners to helping people sentenced to life without parole. Stevenson chronicles how EJI becomes a significant force in criminal justice reform.
In 1983 as a law student, Stevenson discovers his life’s passion when he interns with the Georgia-based Southern Prisoners Defense Committee and meets his first death row prisoner. After graduation Stevenson accepts a job with the organization to represent poor prisoners, including those in Alabama who lack any public defender. He meets Walter McMillian on Alabama’s death row. Walter owns a successful business but also transgresses racial boundaries when he has an affair with a white woman. Soon after the affair becomes public, the woman’s friend, Ralph Myers, accuses Walter of committing the unsolved murder of Ronda Morrison, which has outraged the community. Law enforcement, including a racist sheriff and the district attorney, eagerly pounces on this accusation, overlooking Walter’s alibi and a lack of evidence. Instead, they actively force Ralph to stick with his story even when he tries to recant. They coerce other false witness testimonies, and—as revealed years later—actively suppress evidence.
After Stevenson and the team at EJI unsuccessfully appeal Walter’s conviction, they launch their own investigation of the crime and uncover new evidence. They find witnesses who can prove the witnesses against Walter lied as well as financial records that indicate that one of these witnesses was paid to give false testimony. Stevenson and his team also petition for and receive all records from Walter’s trial. However, their big break comes when they receive a phone call from Ralph, who now wants to make amends. Ralph admits to lying about Walter and says he was threatened by law enforcement. Stevenson wins a hearing for Walter where he can present his new evidence: Ralph’s testimony, which is confirmed by health care workers and other inmates, as well as recordings of the law enforcement team threatening Ralph if he doesn’t frame Walter. 
While the judge refuses to grant Walter relief, Stevenson continues the appeal process through the Alabama courts. The district attorney asks outside agents to investigate the murder for which Walter was convicted, and the investigators determine that Walter had nothing to do with the crime. Six weeks later, the court invalidates Walter’s conviction. Stevenson and the State file a joint motion to dismiss the charges, and Walter is set free.
Throughout the process, Stevenson and Walter become close friends, and Stevenson helps Walter upon his release, including filing a civil suit on his behalf and offering him a place to stay. Walter works with Stevenson to share his story, giving interviews and speaking at legal conferences, and Walter is even featured in a documentary. Unfortunately, Walter is diagnosed with advancing dementia and is forced to rely on family and eventually a nursing facility for his care. He dies in 2013. Stevenson gives a eulogy at his funeral and shares all he learned from Walter, particularly that we must extend mercy to everyone, even those who have not earned it.
Interspersed with chapters chronicling Walter’s narrative are stories of Stevenson’s other clients and work. His closeness with these prisoners and their horrifying circumstances makes Stevenson more determined to help and causes him to reflect on abstract issues that nevertheless imbue the criminal justice system, like humanity and mercy. Stevenson focuses on several categories of vulnerable people who become trapped in the system, including mentally ill prisoners, disabled prisoners, and poor women who give birth to stillborn babies. 
Stevenson and his team at EJI also become increasingly focused on juvenile offenders who are sometimes tried as adults despite their young age. These offenders may be given de facto death sentences by being sentenced to life without parole and face perilous circumstances when they are housed in adult prisons. Stevenson illustrates how these prisoners retain their own humanity while being forced to live under inhumane conditions. He also discusses some of the qualities common among these types of prisoners: They are generally poor and disproportionately people of color, and most of them lack adequate legal counsel. The juveniles have horrific backgrounds of abuse and neglect.
Stevenson and his team at EJI also work to change the legal system to offer more protection to marginalized people. Several of his cases end up before the U.S. Supreme Court, and he succeeds in winning rulings that ban as unconstitutional the conviction of children to life without parole and the execution of people deemed incompetent from dementia or neurological disease. EJI works to raise public awareness of issues surrounding unfair incarceration, produces groundbreaking reports on racial issues, and sets up programs to help formerly incarcerated people adjust to life on the outside.
Stevenson also reflects on the issues that surround the criminal justice system. His time spent with prisoners awaiting their execution makes him realize how inhumane it is to prepare another human to die. After decades of work, when Stevenson fails to prevent the execution of a man who suffers from an intellectual disability, he momentarily feels unable to continue his work. However, he realizes that he cannot help but be broken by his experiences and comes to understand that it is his own brokenness that allows him to more fully understand the need for mercy and to bring compassion to others. The book ends with Stevenson’s renewed commitment to helping others."
Inflicted,"The protagonist, who is named Tim O’Brien, begins by describing an event that occurred in the middle of his Vietnam experience. “The Things They Carried” catalogs the variety of things his fellow soldiers in the Alpha Company brought on their missions. Several of these things are intangible, including guilt and fear, while others are specific physical objects, including matches, morphine, M-16 rifles, and M&M’s candy.
Throughout the collection, the same characters reappear in various stories. The first member of the Alpha Company to die is Ted Lavender, a “grunt,” or low-ranking soldier, who deals with his anxiety about the war by taking tranquilizers and smoking marijuana. Lavender is shot in the head on his way back from going to the bathroom, and his superior, Lieutenant Jimmy Cross, blames himself for the tragedy. When Lavender is shot, Cross is distracting himself with thoughts of Martha, a college crush. It is revealed in “Love” that Cross’s feelings for Martha, whom he dated once before leaving for Vietnam, were never reciprocated, and that even twenty years after the war, his guilt over Lavender’s death remains.
In “On the Rainy River,” the narrator, O’Brien, explains the series of events that led him to Vietnam in the first place. He receives his draft notice in June of 1968, and his feelings of confusion drive him north to the Canadian border, which he contemplates crossing so that he will not be forced to fight in a war in which he doesn’t believe. Sitting in a rowboat with the proprietor of the Tip Top Lodge, where he stays, O’Brien decides that his guilt about avoiding the war and fear of disappointing his family are more important than his political convictions. He soon leaves, going first back home to Worthington, Minnesota and later to Vietnam.
In addition to Ted Lavender, a few other members of the Alpha Company are killed during their mission overseas, including Curt Lemon, who is killed when he steps on a rigged mortar round. Though O’Brien is not close to Lemon, in “The Dentist,” he tells a story of how Lemon, who faints before a routine checkup with an army-issued dentist, tries to save face by insisting that a perfectly good tooth be pulled. Lee Strunk, another member of the company, dies from injuries he sustains by stepping on a landmine. In “Friends,” O’Brien remembers that before Strunk was fatally hurt, Strunk and Dave Jensen had made a pact that if either man were irreparably harmed, the other man would see that he was quickly killed. However, when Strunk is actually hurt, he begs Jensen to spare him, and Jensen complies. Instead of being upset by the news of his friend’s swift death en route to treatment, Jensen is relieved.
The death that receives the most attention in The Things They Carried is that of Kiowa, a much-loved member of the Alpha Company and one of O’Brien’s closest friends. In “Speaking of Courage,” the story of Kiowa’s death is relayed in retrospect through the memory of Norman Bowker, years after the war. As Bowker drives around a lake in his Iowa hometown, he thinks that he failed to save Kiowa, who was killed when a mortar round hit and caused him to sink headfirst into a marshy field. O’Brien realizes that he has dealt with his guilt over Kiowa’s death differently than Norman Bowker in “Notes.” Just before the end of the war, O’Brien receives a long letter from Bowker that says he hasn’t found a way to make life meaningful after the war. O’Brien resolves to tell Bowker’s story, and the story of Kiowa’s death, in order to negotiate his own feelings of guilt and hollowness.
Like “Love” and “Notes,” several of O’Brien’s stories are told from a perspective twenty years after the Vietnam War, when he is a forty-three-year-old writer living in Massachusetts. Exposure to the guilt of old friends like Jimmy Cross and Norman Bowker prompts him to write stories in order to understand what they were going through. But two stories, “The Man I Killed” and “Ambush,” are written so that O’Brien can confront his own guilt over killing a man with a grenade outside the village of My Khe. In “The Man I Killed,” O’Brien imagines the life of his victim, from his childhood to the way things would have turned out for him had O’Brien not spotted him on a path and thrown a grenade at his feet. In “Ambush,” O’Brien imagines how he might relay the story of the man he killed to his nine-year-old daughter, Kathleen. In this second story, O’Brien provides more details of the actual killing—including the sound of the grenade and his own feelings—and explains that even well after the fact, he hasn’t finished sorting out the experience.
In the last story, “The Lives of the Dead,” O’Brien gives another twist to his contention that stories have the power to save people. In the stories of Curt Lemon and Kiowa, O’Brien explains that his imagination allowed him to grapple successfully with his guilt and confusion over the death of his fourth-grade first love, Linda."
Thee,"Starr Carter, a sixteen-year-old black girl, attends a party in her neighborhood, Garden Heights. Starr goes with Kenya, a friend with whom she shares an older half-brother, Seven. Ever since attending Williamson Prep, a primarily white school, Starr feels out of place in the Garden Heights social scene. When Kenya goes off with other friends, Starr runs into her childhood best friend, Khalil Harris, whom she hasn’t seen in a long time. Gunshots from a gang fight interrupt the party, and Khalil offers to take Starr home. While Khalil drives, he explains rapper Tupac Shakur’s idea that “Thug Life” stands for “The Hate U Give Little Infants F---- Everybody.” Soon after, a white police officer with the badge number one-fifteen pulls them over. Khalil questions the motivation for the stop, and One-Fifteen orders him out of the car and searches him. One-Fifteen commands Khalil not to move, and returns to his car. Khalil opens the door to check on Starr. One-Fifteen fatally shoots Khalil.
Starr has nightmares about the death of another childhood friend, Natasha, who died in the crossfire of a gang shooting. At school on Monday, Starr feels tense around Hailey and Chris, her white friend and boyfriend, as memories of Khalil’s death interrupt her thoughts and she realizes they don’t understand. At the urging of her uncle Carlos, a police officer, Starr goes into the police station after school with her mother, Lisa, to testify about Khalil’s shooting. Starr realizes that the officers are asking more questions about whether Khalil was a troublemaker than about the night of the shooting. She worries that justice for Khalil will not be served. At Khalil’s funeral, a lawyer and activist named April Ofrah confirms Starr’s fears when she announces that the police will not pursue legal action against One-Fifteen and invites the attendees to a rally in Khalil’s honor. Starr blames herself for the police’s inaction. King, the head of a local gang called the King Lords, also interrupts the funeral and places a gray bandana on Khalil’s casket, signifying Khalil’s membership in the King Lords. April Ofrah tells Starr to call her if she needs legal representation.
The news that the police won’t prosecute One-Fifteen leads to days of protests in Garden Heights. During this time, Maverick, Starr’s father, explains to her his interpretation of Tupac’s phrase “Thug Life.” He believes that Thug Life describes a system designed against black communities. Only by speaking out can black communities begin to break the cycle. At the Carter family’s grocery store, a teenage member of the King Lords named DeVante begs Maverick, a former King Lord, to help him leave the gang. Maverick agrees. Starr sees DeVante’s request as a chance to help someone in a similar situation as Khalil. A few days later, Maverick gets into an argument with the neighborhood barber, Mr. Lewis. Although the argument is peaceful, two police officers intervene, and when they see Maverick is Starr’s father, they push him to the ground and search him. Between this scary event and pressure from Kenya, Starr decides that she will no longer be silent.
The District Attorney calls Lisa to announce that a grand jury will hear the case against One-Fifteen and asks if Starr will testify. Starr agrees, and April Ofrah decides to represent Starr pro bono, and also find a way to get Starr a television interview. Meanwhile, DeVante tells Starr that Khalil had never been a member of the King Lords and only sold drugs for King to protect his mother, who had stolen money from King. During Starr’s television interview, she decides, against Ms. Ofrah’s advice, to talk about the truth behind Khalil’s drug dealing. Starr’s implication of King enrages him. The night before her grand jury testimony, someone throws a brick and fires a gun into the Carter household. Unsure if the culprits are the King Lords or the police, Starr almost backs out of testifying. However, she ultimately decides that Khalil needs her truth. She testifies before the grand jury.
Almost two months later, the grand jury announces their decision not to indict One-Fifteen. Starr and some of her friends get caught up in the resulting riots. As she tries to avoid the chaos, Starr stumbles upon a protest led by Ms. Ofrah. She offers Starr the megaphone, and Starr leads a chant in front of the protest. The police try to break up the protest with tear gas. Starr and her friends head to the Carter family store to get milk to help heal their eyes. A Molotov cocktail lands in the store, setting it ablaze and trapping them. Maverick arrives just in time to unlock the back door. King arrives to taunt them, proud about getting his revenge. The police arrive, and King, confident that no one will testify against him, claims ignorance. However, the neighbors rally around the Carter family and tell the police that they saw King throw the Molotov cocktail. The police arrest King. Although the grocery store is in ruins, Starr knows that the family will rebuild. She vows to continue fighting for justice on behalf of Khalil and all other black people killed at the hands of police."
Remnant,"The Remains of the Day is told in the first-person narration of an English butler named Stevens. In July 1956, Stevens decides to take a six- day road trip to the West Country of England—a region to the west of Darlington Hall, the house in which Stevens resides and has worked as a butler for thirty-four years. Though the house was previously owned by the now-deceased Lord Darlington, by 1956, it has come under the ownership of Mr. Farraday, an American gentleman. Stevens likes Mr. Farraday, but fails to interact well with him socially: Stevens is a circumspect, serious person and is not comfortable joking around in the manner Mr. Farraday prefers. Stevens terms this skill of casual conversation ""bantering""; several times throughout the novel Stevens proclaims his desire to improve his bantering skill so that he can better please his current employer.
The purpose of Stevens's road trip is to visit Miss Kenton, the former housekeeper of Darlington Hall who left twenty years earlier to get married. Stevens has received a letter from Miss Kenton, and believes that her letter hints that her marriage is failing and that she might like to return to her post as housekeeper. Ever since World War II has ended, it has been difficult to find enough people to staff large manor houses such as Darlington Hall.
Much of the narrative is comprised of Stevens's memories of his work as a butler during and just after World War II. He describes the large, elaborate dinner parties and elegant, prominent personages who come to dine and stay at Darlington Hall in those times. It is gradually revealed—largely through other characters' interactions with Stevens, rather than his own admissions—that Lord Darlington, due to his mistaken impression of the German agenda prior to World War II, sympathized with the Nazis. Darlington even arranged and hosted dinner parties between the German and British heads of state to help both sides come to a peaceful understanding. Stevens always maintains that Lord Darlington was a perfect gentleman, and that it is a shame his reputation has been soiled simply because he misunderstood the Nazis' true aims.
During the trip Stevens also recounts stories of his contemporaries—butlers in other houses with whom he struck up friendships. Stevens's most notable relationship by far, however, is his long-term working relationship with Miss Kenton. Though Stevens never says so outright, it appears that he harbors repressed romantic feelings for Miss Kenton. Despite the fact that the two frequently disagree over various household affairs when they work together, the disagreements are childish in nature and mainly serve to illustrate the fact that the two care for each other. At the end of the novel, Miss Kenton admits to Stevens that her life may have turned out better if she had married him. After hearing these words, Stevens is extremely upset. However, he does not tell Miss Kenton—whose married name is Mrs. Benn—how he feels. Stevens and Miss Kenton part, and Stevens returns to Darlington Hall, his only new resolve being to perfect the art of bantering to please his new employer.
As Salman Rushdie comments, The Remains of the Day is ""a story both beautiful and cruel."" It is a story primarily about regret: throughout his life, Stevens puts his absolute trust and devotion in a man who makes drastic mistakes. In the totality of his professional commitment, Stevens fails to pursue the one woman with whom he could have had a fulfilling and loving relationship. His prim mask of formality cuts him off from intimacy, companionship, and understanding."
Tenets,"Margery Kempe is a well-off middle-class townswoman in the medieval English town of King’s Lynn. After the birth of her first child, Margery has a nervous breakdown, seeing hideous devils all around her. Margery recovers after having a vision of Jesus Christ, and she decides to devote her life to holiness and contemplation of God. One of the first hurdles Margery has to overcome is convincing her husband to live a life of celibacy with her—she succeeds only after having fourteen children. After the failure of a brewing business she starts, Margery becomes certain that God wants her to turn away from the world. Margery’s devotion to Jesus is highly emotional and dramatic, and she soon acquires a reputation as a religious eccentric, a potentially dangerous reputation in a time when heresy was a capital offense. Margery faces doubt and temptation, especially sexual temptation, but she perseveres and often receives guidance in her visions.
Margery makes several pilgrimages, the longest and most difficult of which is a journey to Jerusalem, with a long stopover in Rome. During the pilgrimage, Margery is shunned by her fellow travelers but is often accepted by the poor, a pattern that repeats itself throughout her life. In Jerusalem, Margery has several intense visions, and she begins to have spells in which she sobs and cries uncontrollably. These crying fits come upon her most often during religious services, but they also occur whenever she simply thinks of Jesus or sees something that reminds her of his suffering. Margery is stranded in Rome for a time after giving away her money to the poor, and she makes her way by begging. Margery’s extreme behavior begins to make her notorious, and she makes enemies among the English contingent in Rome. Eventually, Margery is given enough money to return home.
Upon her return to England, Margery does her best to live a life of devotion to Christ. As a married woman, however, she is somewhat constrained, such as by the fact that she cannot become a nun. Margery travels to various churches and holy sites in England, attracting attention wherever she goes, thanks to her public weeping and her all-white wardrobe. At times, Margery is accepted as a holy woman, and her advice and blessings are solicited. More often, she is treated as an oddity or a nuisance and mocked. On occasion, the hostile attention she draws goes beyond mockery. Traveling through the north of England, Margery is arrested several times and almost burned at the stake as a heretic, though she is saved by the intervention of the church authorities. Each time she is arrested, Margery defends herself vigorously. She is respectful to authority but firm in her beliefs, none of which are heretical, as her examiners soon see.
Margery continues to have mystical visions of Jesus, the Virgin Mary, and several saints. Margery’s devotion to Christ is particularly intense and is expressed in highly physical, even sexual, terms. In her visions, Margery often sees herself as a servant to Mary or Jesus, acting as an eyewitness to the events of the gospels. Jesus speaks to Margery in her visions of such subjects as the Trinity, the salvation and damnation of souls, and the meaning of the constant tears he sends her. Margery tries to spend as much time as she can in prayer or in conversation with her spiritual guides. Even so, her dramatic weeping in church and elsewhere continues to draw attention and, often, censure. Margery comes into particular conflict with a friar who moves to Lynn and refuses to allow Margery to hear him preach because of her disruptive weeping.
As time goes on, Margery’s husband becomes old and infirm, and Margery returns to his household to care for him. One of Margery’s sons turns from his sinful ways after much praying and beseeching by Margery, and he marries a German woman. The couple comes to England for a visit, and the son takes ill and dies, soon followed by his father. In her last extended journey, Margery accompanies her daughter-in-law (who is less than enthusiastic about being joined by her odd mother-in-law) back to Germany, only deciding to leave at the last minute. Margery’s trip overland from Germany to France is her most grueling yet, and she is again scorned by other travelers from England, to whom she turns for help. Eventually, Margery makes it to London and finally back to Lynn. Home once again, Margery, now an old woman, decides to record the story of her life and her devotions, and begins the dictation of her Book."
Quiet,"All Quiet on the Western Front is narrated by Paul Bäumer, a young man of nineteen who fights in the German army on the French front in World War I. Paul and several of his friends from school joined the army voluntarily after listening to the stirring patriotic speeches of their teacher, Kantorek. But after experiencing ten weeks of brutal training at the hands of the petty, cruel Corporal Himmelstoss and the unimaginable brutality of life on the front, Paul and his friends have realized that the ideals of nationalism and patriotism for which they enlisted are simply empty clichés. They no longer believe that war is glorious or honorable, and they live in constant physical terror.
When Paul’s company receives a short reprieve after two weeks of fighting, only eighty men of the original 150-man company return from the front. The cook doesn’t want to give the survivors the rations that were meant for the dead men but eventually agrees to do so; the men thus enjoy a large meal. Paul and his friends visit Kemmerich, a former classmate who has recently had a leg amputated after contracting gangrene. Kemmerich is slowly dying, and Müller, another former classmate, wants Kemmerich’s boots for himself. Paul doesn’t consider Müller insensitive; like the other soldiers, Müller simply realizes pragmatically that Kemmerich no longer needs his boots. Surviving the agony of war, Paul observes, forces one to learn to disconnect oneself from emotions like grief, sympathy, and fear. Not long after this encounter, Paul returns to Kemmerich’s bedside just as the young man dies. At Kemmerich’s request, Paul takes his boots to Müller.
A group of new recruits comes to reinforce the company, and Paul’s friend Kat produces a beef and bean stew that impresses them. Kat says that if all the men in an army, including the officers, were paid the same wage and given the same food, wars would be over immediately. Kropp, another of Paul’s former classmates, says that there should be no armies; he argues that a nation’s leaders should instead fight out their disagreements with clubs. They discuss the fact that petty, insignificant people become powerful and arrogant during war, and Tjaden, a member of Paul’s company, announces that the cruel Corporal Himmelstoss has come to fight at the front.
At night, the men go on a harrowing mission to lay barbed wire at the front. Pounded by artillery, they hide in a graveyard, where the force of the shelling causes the buried corpses to emerge from their graves, as groups of living men fall dead around them. After this gruesome event, the surviving soldiers return to their camp, where they kill lice and think about what they will do at the end of the war. Some of the men have tentative plans, but all of them seem to feel that the war will never end. Paul fears that if the war did end, he wouldn’t know what to do with himself. Himmelstoss arrives at the front; when the men see him, Tjaden insults him. The men’s lieutenant gives them light punishment but also lectures Himmelstoss about the futility of saluting at the front. Paul and Kat find a house with a goose and roast the goose for supper, enjoying a rare good meal.
The company is caught in a bloody battle with a charging group of Allied infantrymen. Men are blown apart, limbs are severed from torsos, and giant rats pick at the dead and the wounded. Paul feels that he must become an animal in battle, trusting only his instincts to keep him alive. After the battle, only thirty-two of eighty men are still alive. The men are given a short reprieve at a field depot. Paul and some of his friends go for a swim, which ends in a rendezvous with a group of French girls. Paul desperately wishes to recapture his innocence with a girl, but he feels that it is impossible to do so.
Paul receives seventeen days of leave and goes home to see his family. He feels awkward and oppressed in his hometown, unable to discuss his traumatic experiences with anyone. He learns that his mother is dying of cancer and that Kantorek has been conscripted as a soldier, from which he derives a certain cold satisfaction. He visits Kemmerich’s mother and tells her, untruthfully, that her son’s death was instant and painless. At the end of his leave, Paul spends some time at a training camp near a group of Russian prisoners-of-war. Paul feels that the Russians are people just like him, not subhuman enemies, and wonders how war can make enemies of people who have no grudge against one another.
Paul is sent back to his company and is reunited with his friends. The kaiser, the German emperor, pays a visit to the front, and the men are disappointed to see that he is merely a short man with a weak voice. In battle, Paul is separated from his company and forced to hide in a shell hole. A French soldier jumps into the shell hole with him, and Paul instinctively stabs him. As the man dies a slow, painful death, Paul is overcome with remorse for having hurt him. He feels again that this enemy soldier is no enemy at all but rather a victim of war just like himself. Paul looks through the soldier’s things and finds that his name was Gérard Duval and learns that Duval had a wife and child at home. When he returns to his company, Paul recounts the incident to his friends, who try to console him.
Paul and his friends are given an easy assignment: for three weeks, they are to guard a supply depot away from the fighting. When the next battle takes place, Paul and Kropp are wounded and forced to bribe a sergeant-major with cigars in order to be placed on the hospital train together. At the hospital, Paul undergoes surgery. Kropp’s leg is amputated, and he becomes extremely depressed. After his surgery, Paul has a short leave at home before he returns to his company.
As the German army begins to give in to the unrelenting pressure of the Allied forces, Paul’s friends are killed in combat one by one. Detering, one of Paul’s close friends, attempts to desert but is caught and court-martialed. Kat is killed when a piece of shrapnel slices his head open while Paul is carrying him to safety. By the fall of 1918, Paul is the only one of his circle of friends who is still alive. Soldiers everywhere whisper that the Germans will soon surrender and that peace will come. Paul is poisoned in a gas attack and given a short leave. He reflects that, when the war ends, he will be ruined for peacetime; all he knows is the war. In October 1918, on a day with very little fighting, Paul is killed. The army report for that day reads simply: “All quiet on the Western Front.” Paul’s corpse wears a calm expression, as though relieved that the end has come at last."
Problems,"Lawyer Bryan Stevenson gives a first-person account of his decades helping marginalized Americans who have been unfairly and harshly punished by the U.S. criminal justice system, which disproportionately targets people of color and poor people. At the heart of Just Mercy is the story of Walter McMillian, a Black man who was framed for the murder of a girl named Ronda Morrison, convicted, and sent to death row. 
Stevenson alternates chapters about Walter with his personal reflections on our country’s history with racial disparity and issues around incarceration. Stevenson highlights other groups of vulnerable people who have been victimized by the criminal justice system and shares the stories of the prisoners he has helped over the years. The book also follows the growth of Stevenson’s nonprofit law project, the Alabama-based Equal Justice Initiative (EJI), through its expansion from focusing on death row prisoners to helping people sentenced to life without parole. Stevenson chronicles how EJI becomes a significant force in criminal justice reform.
In 1983 as a law student, Stevenson discovers his life’s passion when he interns with the Georgia-based Southern Prisoners Defense Committee and meets his first death row prisoner. After graduation Stevenson accepts a job with the organization to represent poor prisoners, including those in Alabama who lack any public defender. He meets Walter McMillian on Alabama’s death row. Walter owns a successful business but also transgresses racial boundaries when he has an affair with a white woman. Soon after the affair becomes public, the woman’s friend, Ralph Myers, accuses Walter of committing the unsolved murder of Ronda Morrison, which has outraged the community. Law enforcement, including a racist sheriff and the district attorney, eagerly pounces on this accusation, overlooking Walter’s alibi and a lack of evidence. Instead, they actively force Ralph to stick with his story even when he tries to recant. They coerce other false witness testimonies, and—as revealed years later—actively suppress evidence.
After Stevenson and the team at EJI unsuccessfully appeal Walter’s conviction, they launch their own investigation of the crime and uncover new evidence. They find witnesses who can prove the witnesses against Walter lied as well as financial records that indicate that one of these witnesses was paid to give false testimony. Stevenson and his team also petition for and receive all records from Walter’s trial. However, their big break comes when they receive a phone call from Ralph, who now wants to make amends. Ralph admits to lying about Walter and says he was threatened by law enforcement. Stevenson wins a hearing for Walter where he can present his new evidence: Ralph’s testimony, which is confirmed by health care workers and other inmates, as well as recordings of the law enforcement team threatening Ralph if he doesn’t frame Walter. 
While the judge refuses to grant Walter relief, Stevenson continues the appeal process through the Alabama courts. The district attorney asks outside agents to investigate the murder for which Walter was convicted, and the investigators determine that Walter had nothing to do with the crime. Six weeks later, the court invalidates Walter’s conviction. Stevenson and the State file a joint motion to dismiss the charges, and Walter is set free.
Throughout the process, Stevenson and Walter become close friends, and Stevenson helps Walter upon his release, including filing a civil suit on his behalf and offering him a place to stay. Walter works with Stevenson to share his story, giving interviews and speaking at legal conferences, and Walter is even featured in a documentary. Unfortunately, Walter is diagnosed with advancing dementia and is forced to rely on family and eventually a nursing facility for his care. He dies in 2013. Stevenson gives a eulogy at his funeral and shares all he learned from Walter, particularly that we must extend mercy to everyone, even those who have not earned it.
Interspersed with chapters chronicling Walter’s narrative are stories of Stevenson’s other clients and work. His closeness with these prisoners and their horrifying circumstances makes Stevenson more determined to help and causes him to reflect on abstract issues that nevertheless imbue the criminal justice system, like humanity and mercy. Stevenson focuses on several categories of vulnerable people who become trapped in the system, including mentally ill prisoners, disabled prisoners, and poor women who give birth to stillborn babies. 
Stevenson and his team at EJI also become increasingly focused on juvenile offenders who are sometimes tried as adults despite their young age. These offenders may be given de facto death sentences by being sentenced to life without parole and face perilous circumstances when they are housed in adult prisons. Stevenson illustrates how these prisoners retain their own humanity while being forced to live under inhumane conditions. He also discusses some of the qualities common among these types of prisoners: They are generally poor and disproportionately people of color, and most of them lack adequate legal counsel. The juveniles have horrific backgrounds of abuse and neglect.
Stevenson and his team at EJI also work to change the legal system to offer more protection to marginalized people. Several of his cases end up before the U.S. Supreme Court, and he succeeds in winning rulings that ban as unconstitutional the conviction of children to life without parole and the execution of people deemed incompetent from dementia or neurological disease. EJI works to raise public awareness of issues surrounding unfair incarceration, produces groundbreaking reports on racial issues, and sets up programs to help formerly incarcerated people adjust to life on the outside.
Stevenson also reflects on the issues that surround the criminal justice system. His time spent with prisoners awaiting their execution makes him realize how inhumane it is to prepare another human to die. After decades of work, when Stevenson fails to prevent the execution of a man who suffers from an intellectual disability, he momentarily feels unable to continue his work. However, he realizes that he cannot help but be broken by his experiences and comes to understand that it is his own brokenness that allows him to more fully understand the need for mercy and to bring compassion to others. The book ends with Stevenson’s renewed commitment to helping others."
Spending,"A Raisin in the Sun portrays a few weeks in the life of the Youngers, a Black family living on the South Side of Chicago in the 1950s. When the play opens, the Youngers are about to receive an insurance check for $10,000. This money comes from the deceased Mr. Younger’s life insurance policy. Each of the adult members of the family has an idea as to what he or she would like to do with this money. The matriarch of the family, Mama, wants to buy a house to fulfill a dream she shared with her husband. Mama’s son, Walter Lee, would rather use the money to invest in a liquor store with his friends. He believes that the investment will solve the family’s financial problems forever. Walter’s wife, Ruth, agrees with Mama, however, and hopes that she and Walter can provide more space and opportunity for their son, Travis. Finally, Beneatha, Walter’s sister and Mama’s daughter, wants to use the money for her medical school tuition. She also wishes that her family members were not so interested in assimilating into the white world. Beneatha instead tries to find her identity by looking back to the past and to Africa.
As the play progresses, the Youngers clash over their competing dreams. Ruth discovers that she is pregnant but fears that if she has the child, she will put more financial pressure on her family members. When Walter says nothing to Ruth’s admission that she is considering abortion, Mama puts a down payment on a house for the whole family. She believes that a bigger, brighter dwelling will help them all. This house is in Clybourne Park, an entirely white neighborhood. When the Youngers’ future neighbors find out that the Youngers are moving in, they send Mr. Lindner, from the Clybourne Park Improvement Association, to offer the Youngers money in return for staying away. The Youngers refuse the deal, even after Walter loses the rest of the money ($6,500) to his friend Willy Harris, who persuades Walter to invest in the liquor store and then runs off with his cash.
In the meantime, Beneatha rejects her suitor, George Murchison, whom she believes to be shallow and blind to the problems of race. Subsequently, she receives a marriage proposal from her Nigerian boyfriend, Joseph Asagai, who wants Beneatha to get a medical degree and move to Africa with him (Beneatha does not make her choice before the end of the play). The Youngers eventually move out of the apartment, fulfilling the family’s long-held dream. Their future seems uncertain and slightly dangerous, but they are optimistic and determined to live a better life. They believe that they can succeed if they stick together as a family and resolve to defer their dreams no longer."
Halfway,"Speak, by Laurie Halse Anderson, chronicles the struggles of thirteen-year-old Melinda Sordino after she is a raped by at a party the summer before her freshman year of high school by another student. Melinda tells her story in first person narrative. She describes events within the framework of the four marking periods of the school year.
In the opening part of Speak, “First Marking Period,” Melinda begins high school, and we learn that former friends now hate her. She experiences humiliation in the cafeteria and Mr. Neck, a social studies teacher, further embarrasses her by giving her demerits on the first day of school. Ostracized by her former friends, she befriends Heather, a new girl at the school. Heather seeks popularity, and she badgers Melinda to join various clubs. Rachel, Melinda’s ex-best friend, hasn’t tried to find out the truth about what really happened to Melinda that night at the party over the summer.
Melinda describes her classes, activities, and thoughts. Her project in Mr. Freeman’s art class is to create a work of art based on a “tree,” which is the object named on the piece of paper she randomly chooses. In biology, Melinda thinks that David Petrakis, her lab partner, might be cute without the braces. And in algebra, when Mr. Stetman has Rachel come to the board to help Melinda with a problem, Melinda is humiliated. 
Melinda often skips class using stolen late passes and doesn’t complete her homework. She finds refuge at school in a vacant janitor’s closet, which she turns into her “burrow.” At the Homecoming Rally, students bully her for being the one who called the cops that night at the party.
At home, Melinda and her parents communicate with each other by leaving notes on the refrigerator. In her bedroom, she no longer wants to look in the mirror and puts it in the back of her closet. Toward the end of the marking period, Melinda’s parents hear from the school about her missing work, and she remains silent while they berate her for failing. Through it all, Melinda sees “IT” everywhere, the nightmare from which she cannot awaken.
In “Second Marking Period,” school is a grind for Melinda. At her parents’ insistence, she stays after to finish her homework, but she goes to her burrow and naps instead. In social studies, David Petrakis stands up against Mr. Neck’s racist rant about immigration. In biology, she finds that a seed within the apple she has cut is already growing. Heather gives her an early Christmas present, and Melinda decides she’ll give Heather a friendship necklace. 
On Christmas, Melinda nearly tells her parents what happened that night last summer but can’t. Winter break is miserable. Her parents keep her busy working for them, and she is relieved when school starts again. 
In gym class, Melinda impresses the basketball coaches with skills but has no interest in being on the team. She reluctantly helps Heather in her attempts to become an initiated member of a do-good club. And in biology, when she and David dissect a frog, she faints when preparing to slice it open. 
Melinda’s parents receive another call from the guidance counselor about her grades. After their verbal assault, Melinda goes to her room and uses an open paper clip to scrape at her wrist. 
“IT”, who we learn is Andy Evans, harasses Melinda in the cafeteria, and she runs to the bathroom to vomit. She has yet to tell anyone, even the reader, about what happened that summer night.
In “Third Marking Period,” Melinda continues to skip school and avoid Andy Evans. Heather ends their friendship suddenly, and later returns the friendship necklace Melinda had given her for Christmas. No one, Melinda is sure, “would like the inside girl I think I am.” 
The school counselors hold another meeting with Melinda’s parents, who berate and threaten her. She refuses to talk or defend herself. She receives In-School Suspension, and IT is there. He sits next to her and blows in her ear when Mr. Neck isn’t looking. 
In art class, Mr. Freeman gives Melinda a book about Picasso to help her “paralyzed” imagination. Picasso’s art inspires her, and she begins to draw. Mr. Freeman recognizes that she has a lot to say.
Melinda works to meet the expectations set for her. Yet, with “no friends in the known universe,” Melinda sits alone at lunch, wondering if everyone is talking and laughing about her. 
One afternoon, after a basketball game, David Petrakis invites her to his house for pizza to celebrate the team’s one-point win. She declines, torn between getting a life, and the fact that the world is a dangerous place.
At last, Melinda reveals that she was attacked at a party last summer, though she does not use the word “rape.” At this point, we (the readers) are the only ones besides Melinda who know what happened.
In “Fourth Marking Period,” Melinda takes her ex-friend Ivy’s advice and tries drawing a tree instead of carving one from linoleum block. She also learns that Rachel is dating Andy Evans. Compelled to do something, she writes a note to Rachel warning her about Andy. In the note, she admits for the first time (but without divulging her identity), that she was raped. 
Springtime arrives, and Melinda finds solace working in the garden. She and David plan a protest in social studies class over an oral report she is supposed to present, and she stands up to Heather by refusing to help her decorate for the Senior Prom. She writes on a stall in the bathroom, “Guys to Stay Away From: Andy Evans.” Andy Evans continues to bully her. 
Melinda feels compelled to tell Rachel the truth about Andy and what happened that night. But, when Rachel learns that Andy Evans was Melinda’s attacker, she accuses Melinda of being jealous and calls her a “twisted little freak.” Later, Ivy brings Melinda into the bathroom stall. Other girls have added words like “creep” and “bastard” under Andy Evan’s name. Seeing that, Melinda feels like she can fly.
Melinda realizes she doesn’t need her burrow anymore. When she is clearing her items out of the closet, Andy Evans barges in, attacks Melinda, and tries to rape her again. She finds her voice and screams “NNNOOO!!” He does not back off, so Melinda breaks a mirror, takes a shard of glass, and holds it to his neck. “I said no,” she tells him. People who had heard her scream run for help.
With hours left in the school year, Melinda finds herself a sort of hero. She finishes her tree project, receiving an A+ from Mr. Freeman."
Mainly,"Maus: A Survivor’s Tale is the illustrated true story of Vladek Spiegelman’s experiences during World War II, as told by his son, Artie. It consists of Book One: My Father Bleeds History, and Book Two: And Here My Troubles Began / From Mauschwitz to the Catskills and Beyond.
While the story is primarily focused on Vladek’s life, there is also a frame narrative (or, a story within the story) that shows Artie and his father interacting in the present, with Artie asking questions as Vladek relays his experiences. As Vladek describes the horrors that he faced as a Jewish person in World War II, there are interspersed scenes that reveal some of the challenges that Artie faces as the son of a concentration camp survivor. For example, Vladek is obsessive about money and constantly fusses over Artie’s clothes, decisions, and refusal to eat everything on his plate (even though Artie is an adult).
Except for a brief scene that depicts Artie as a human wearing a mouse mask, all of the people in the story appear as anthropomorphic animals. Jews are depicted as mice, Germans as cats, Poles as pigs, French as frogs, and Americans as dogs.
The story begins around 1978, with Artie visiting his father Vladek in New York City. Vladek looks frail and unhealthy; he’s had two heart attacks, and the suicide of his wife Anja (Artie’s mother) a decade earlier has taken a serious toll on him. Vladek is remarried to a woman named Mala with whom he constantly argues. Artie asks Vladek to tell him stories about life during World War II so that he can create a comic book based on Vladek’s experiences. 
Vladek starts his story in 1935, when he was living in Poland. After marrying Anja Zylberberg, Vladek moves to Sosnowiec, Poland, where her wealthy family helps them get established. Vladek and Anja have a son named Richieu, and Anja’s father, a millionaire, gives Vladek money to buy a factory in Bielsko. Vladek runs the factory during the week and returns home to Sosnowiec on the weekends to visit Anja and Richieu. Anja has a breakdown due to severe postpartum depression, and Vladek stays with her in a sanitarium in Czechoslovakia until she recovers. In 1939, Vladek is drafted into the Polish army and sent to the frontlines to fight the Nazis, where he is captured and becomes a prisoner of war. Vladek is eventually released back to Poland, and he returns to Anja and Richieu in Sosnoweic.
As the war continues, the Nazis begin rounding up Jewish people in Sosnowiec and sending them away on trains. Food and resources become scarce, and Vladek begins trading goods on the black market in order to provide for his family. Several of his friends are caught trading goods and executed. The Nazis later order that everyone report to the local stadium to have their papers verified; once there, many Jews are taken away for deportation. Luckily, Vladek’s cousin is working one of the tables at the stadium, and he is able to secure Vladek’s release, as well as Anja’s and her parents’. Vladek’s sister Fela, Fela’s four children, and Vladek’s father are not as fortunate—they are never seen again.
During one of Artie’s visits to help his father and record his stories about World War II, he finds out that his father read a comic he drew years before. The comic, Prisoner on the Hell Planet: A Case History, is included in Maus. It depicts Artie as a prisoner and shows the mental and emotional pain he endured because of his mother’s suicide in 1968.
Continuing on with his story, Vladek says that after leaving the stadium, he and his family were relocated to a ghetto in Srodula. In order to keep Richieu safe, Vladek and Anja send him to live with Anja’s sister Tosha in Zawiercie. They later find out that when Tosha discovered that she and the rest of the Jews in Zawiercie were going to be shipped to Auschwitz, she poisoned Richieu, herself, and her two children in order to spare them a worse fate at the camp.
When Vladek and Anja realize that the Germans are going to send everyone in the ghetto to concentration camps, they go into hiding to avoid capture. Once the ghetto is empty, Vladek and Anja begin to walk back to Sosnowiec. Along the way, they secure passage to Hungary with some smugglers, but the smugglers betray them and hand them over to the Germans. Vladek is sent to Auschwitz, and Anja is taken to Birkenau.
Vladek tells Artie that Anja kept diaries after the war, but Vladek destroyed them in a fit of grief. Artie becomes upset and yells at his father, saying that they would have had valuable information in them. At the beginning of Book Two, while Artie is staying with friends in Vermont, he receives a call from Vladek: Mala has left him and taken some of their shared valuables. Fearing that he will be responsible for taking care of his father, Artie goes to visit him in New York.
Vladek continues his story and describes the terrible conditions in Auschwitz. While working there, he uses his knowledge of trade skills to remain valuable and avoid execution. He learns that Anja is in the secondary camp, Auschwitz Birkenau, and arranges to do some repairs there so that he can see her. After hoarding the few resources available, Vladek bribes some of the Nazi guards to have Anja relocated to his camp to work in the munitions shop.
Vladek continues his story, describing the various ways that he used his skills and resourcefulness to help himself and Anja survive at Auschwitz. As the Russian army closes in on Auschwitz, Vladek is tasked with dismantling the gas chambers. All of the prisoners are eventually evacuated and relocated to Dachau, a camp in Germany. Vladek contracts typhus from the lice at Dachau and becomes very sick. He is sent toward Switzerland by train to be traded as a prisoner of war and is eventually rescued by American soldiers. After traveling back through Germany to Poland, he is reunited with Anja.
When Artie visits his father to hear the last of the story, Vladek is very sick. Mala has returned to help, but is still frustrated by Vladek. When Artie starts to leave, Vladek, confused and tired, calls him Richieu."
Wings,"It is the late twentieth century. Both the United States and the Soviet Union are about to enter outer space using nuclear-powered spaceships. Just as both countries close in on the achievement of space travel, a number of giant alien spaceships come down over every major city in the world.
Five years later, these aliens, known as the Overlords, have taken control of the entire world. Their flagship is based over New York and is managed by Karellen, the Overlord who is charge of Earth-related affairs. The humans know Karellen as ""the Supervisor."" Karellen uses the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Stormgren, as his liaison to the human race. Once every few weeks, Karellen meets with Stormgren inside his ship. However, neither Stormgren nor any other human has ever seen what an Overlord looks like.
Stormgren is attempting to placate the Freedom League, a group that opposes the Overlords' dominion, no matter how friendly the aliens seem to be. A radical fringe group of the Freedom League kidnaps Stormgren; Karellen uses Stormgren as bait so he can keep track of these radicals. The radicals do give Stormgren the idea to use a scanning device to try and find out what is inside the room where he and Karellen meet. Stormgren then meets with Karellen, who announces that the Overlords will reveal themselves in fifty years. Stormgren then uses the scanner and discovers that Karellen is on the other side of the blank ""viewscreen""--it's just a piece of one-way glass. Later, as he is handing over the paperwork for the World Federation, a new world government, Stormgren uses a flashlight to sneak a glimpse of Karellen.
Fifty years later, the Earth has greatly changed. It has become a utopia, where everyone has a place to live and enough food to eat. The Overlords have altered the world and raised the standard of living for everyone. At this time, the Overlords reveal themselves: they look almost exactly like the Devil, with dark black skin, giant wings, horns on their heads, and a barbed tail.
A few years later, George Greggson and Jean Morrel attend a party held by Rupert Boyce, an amateur scholar of the paranormal. While there, George and Jean run into Rashaverak, an Overlord making use of Boyce's research library. George also meets Jan Rodricks, a restless astronomer who is annoyed that the Overlords will not let mankind explore space. During the party, Boyce organizes a séance using a mechanized Ouija board. The board gives surprisingly accurate answers, and when Jan asks where the Overlords' homeworld is, it gives an exact star number. Jean faints after this incident. This fainting fit worries George, and he proposes marriage to Jean. Meanwhile, Jan takes the information he has learned and confirms it: the Overlord supply ships take off in the direction of the star given by the Ouija board. Rashaverak reports to Karellen and informs him that Jean should be watched, as she may be ""the most important human alive.""
After speaking again with Boyce, Jan gets an idea of how to sneak aboard an Overlord vessel. He meets with Sullivan and makes a plan to stow away inside a giant sperm whale that Sullivan is stuffing for the Overlords. The plan succeeds, and soon Jan is on his way to the Overlord homeworld. While the trip will seem like only a few months to him, due to time dilation at the speed of light eighty years will pass on Earth.
Back on Earth, George and Jean begin their life together. Eventually, George comes to believe he is stuck in a rut, and the couple decide to go to New Athens, an experimental community based on an island. The members of the community are primarily artists, and the hope is that they will reinvigorate the stagnating imagination of humanity. George and Jean take their two kids, Jeffrey and Jennifer, with them. The family adjusts to life on New Athens fairly well, but one day, a tsunami hits the island while Jeffrey is down at the beach. Jeffrey mysteriously survives and says that he heard a voice in his head that told him where to run.
A few weeks later, an Overlord visits New Athens. He tells the community he is just performing a routine inspection, but actually he is checking on Jeffrey. A few weeks after his visit, Jeffrey begins to have strange dreams, where he is walking across alien landscapes. His parents don't know what to make of the dreams, but the Overlords recognize the planets he describes as real worlds. George meets with Rashaverak, who tells him that his children aren't human-- they're something beyond humanity.
Jennifer, even though she is a baby, soon begins to exhibit powers herself--and her powers are even greater than those of Jeffrey. Soon all the children of the world are showing signs of strange mental powers. Karellen addresses all of mankind one last time, telling them that their children are taking a new evolutionary step. This is why the Overlords were sent to Earth--sent by the Overmind, a powerful being of thought and energy that absorbs and assimilates races once they have matured enough. Ironically, this is a step that the Overlords have never been able to make and may never be able to. The rest of humanity, however, is doomed. While the Overlords round up the children, many people decide to kill themselves. Jean and George die as New Athens blows itself up in a nuclear explosion.
Back on the Overlords spaceship, Jan arrives on the Overlords' homeworld. He is subjected to many tests by the curious Overlords and asked many questions. He is allowed to explore their cities a little bit, and he sees a strange mountain that may be an avatar of the Overmind. Finally, however, he is shipped back home. Nothing prepares him for what he sees: the Earth is deserted, except for three hundred million strange children. They have slowly been growing in power and ability, and their individual personalities have all but vanished. Soon, the Overmind will arrive, and the Earth will be destroyed as the children join the Overmind. While the Overlords prepare to leave, Jan decides to stay on Earth. As he watches, the Overmind arrives and absorbs the children. In the process, the children consume the Earth's crust, causing it to explode. The children consume all of the Earth for energy as they complete their transformation into the Overmind. From his ship, thousands of kilometers away, Karellen watches the end of humanity. He then awaits his next call from the Overmind and continues to explore its secrets."
City,"The year is 1775, and social ills plague both France and England. Jerry Cruncher, an odd-job man who works for Tellson’s Bank, stops the Dover mail-coach with an urgent message for Jarvis Lorry. The message instructs Lorry to wait at Dover for a young woman, and Lorry responds with the cryptic words, “Recalled to Life.” At Dover, Lorry is met by Lucie Manette, a young orphan whose father, a once-eminent doctor whom she supposed dead, has been discovered in France. Lorry escorts Lucie to Paris, where they meet Defarge, a former servant of Doctor Manette, who has kept Manette safe in a garret. Driven mad by eighteen years in the Bastille, Manette spends all of his time making shoes, a hobby he learned while in prison. Lorry assures Lucie that her love and devotion can recall her father to life, and indeed they do.
The year is now 1780. Charles Darnay stands accused of treason against the English crown. A bombastic lawyer named Stryver pleads Darnay’s case, but it is not until his drunk, good-for-nothing colleague, Sydney Carton, assists him that the court acquits Darnay. Carton clinches his argument by pointing out that he himself bears an uncanny resemblance to the defendant, which undermines the prosecution’s case for unmistakably identifying Darnay as the spy the authorities spotted. Lucie and Doctor Manette watched the court proceedings, and that night, Carton escorts Darnay to a tavern and asks how it feels to receive the sympathy of a woman like Lucie. Carton despises and resents Darnay because he reminds him of all that he himself has given up and might have been.
In France, the cruel Marquis Evrémonde runs down a plebian child with his carriage. Manifesting an attitude typical of the aristocracy in regard to the poor at that time, the Marquis shows no regret, but instead curses the peasantry and hurries home to his chateau, where he awaits the arrival of his nephew, Darnay, from England. Arriving later that night, Darnay curses his uncle and the French aristocracy for its abominable treatment of the people. He renounces his identity as an Evrémonde and announces his intention to return to England. That night, the Marquis is murdered; the murderer has left a note signed with the nickname adopted by French revolutionaries: “Jacques.”
A year passes, and Darnay asks Manette for permission to marry Lucie. He says that, if Lucie accepts, he will reveal his true identity to Manette. Carton, meanwhile, also pledges his love to Lucie, admitting that, though his life is worthless, she has helped him dream of a better, more valuable existence. On the streets of London, Jerry Cruncher gets swept up in the funeral procession for a spy named Roger Cly. Later that night, he demonstrates his talents as a “Resurrection-Man,” sneaking into the cemetery to steal and sell Cly’s body. In Paris, meanwhile, another English spy known as John Barsad drops into Defarge’s wine shop. Barsad hopes to turn up evidence concerning the mounting revolution, which is still in its covert stages. Madame Defarge sits in the shop knitting a secret registry of those whom the revolution seeks to execute. Back in London, Darnay, on the morning of his wedding, keeps his promise to Manette; he reveals his true identity and, that night, Manette relapses into his old prison habit of making shoes. After nine days, Manette regains his presence of mind, and soon joins the newlyweds on their honeymoon. Upon Darnay’s return, Carton pays him a visit and asks for his friendship. Darnay assures Carton that he is always welcome in their home.
The year is now 1789. The peasants in Paris storm the Bastille and the French Revolution begins. The revolutionaries murder aristocrats in the streets, and Gabelle, a man charged with the maintenance of the Evrémonde estate, is imprisoned. Three years later, he writes to Darnay, asking to be rescued. Despite the threat of great danger to his person, Darnay departs immediately for France.
As soon as Darnay arrives in Paris, the French revolutionaries arrest him as an emigrant. Lucie and Manette make their way to Paris in hopes of saving him. Darnay remains in prison for a year and three months before receiving a trial. In order to help free him, Manette uses his considerable influence with the revolutionaries, who sympathize with him for having served time in the Bastille. Darnay receives an acquittal, but that same night he is arrested again. The charges, this time, come from Defarge and his vengeful wife. Carton arrives in Paris with a plan to rescue Darnay and obtains the help of John Barsad, who turns out to be Solomon Pross, the long-lost brother of Miss Pross, Lucie’s loyal servant.
At Darnay’s trial, Defarge produces a letter that he discovered in Manette’s old jail cell in the Bastille. The letter explains the cause of Manette’s imprisonment. Years ago, the brothers Evrémonde (Darnay’s father and uncle) enlisted Manette’s medical assistance. They asked him to tend to a woman, whom one of the brothers had raped, and her brother, whom the same brother had stabbed fatally. Fearing that Manette might report their misdeeds, the Evrémondes had him arrested. Upon hearing this story, the jury condemns Darnay for the crimes of his ancestors and sentences him to die within twenty-four hours. That night, at the Defarge’s wine shop, Carton overhears Madame Defarge plotting to have Lucie and her daughter (also Darnay’s daughter) executed as well; Madame Defarge, it turns out, is the surviving sibling of the man and woman killed by the Evrémondes. Carton arranges for the Manettes’ immediate departure from France. He then visits Darnay in prison, tricks him into changing clothes with him, and, after dictating a letter of explanation, drugs his friend unconscious. Barsad carries Darnay, now disguised as Carton, to an awaiting coach, while Carton, disguised as Darnay, awaits execution. As Darnay, Lucie, their child, and Dr. Manette speed away from Paris, Madame Defarge arrives at Lucie’s apartment, hoping to arrest her. There she finds the supremely protective Miss Pross. A scuffle ensues, and Madame Defarge dies by the bullet of her own gun. Sydney Carton meets his death at the guillotine, and the narrator confidently asserts that Carton dies with the knowledge that he has finally imbued his life with meaning."
Was,"Go Down, Moses is a collection of short stories (and two longer stories, ""The Fire and the Hearth"" and ""The Bear"") that, together, tell the composite history of the McCaslin family, of the descendents of Carothers McCaslin and the residents of the plantation he founded. The complete histories emerge gradually over the course of the book, with bits of information appearing in successive stories to clarify, complete, and sometimes controvert the information given in previous stories. But each story has its own plot, as well, independent of the other stories. The stories are:
""Was,"" in which young McCaslin Edmonds helps his Uncle Buck chase the slave Turl to Hubert Beauchamp's plantation, where Buck narrowly avoids having to marry Beauchamp's sister Sophonsiba, and returns with Tennie, a slave for Turl to marry--which will stop him from escaping so often.
""The Fire and the Hearth,"" in which Lucas Beauchamp, Carothers McCaslin's grandson descended from a negro lover, searches for buried treasure on the McCaslin plantation, only to be thwarted by his wife's decision to divorce him.
""The Pantaloon in Black,"" in which a big negro named Rider struggles with grief over his wife Mannie's early death and ends up killing a white man and getting lynched in retribution.
""The Old People,"" in which a young boy named Isaac McCaslin, under the tutelage of his part-Indian mentor Sam Fathers, kills his first buck, is anointed in its blood, and sees a giant, almost mystical buck that Sam refers to as ""grandfather.""
""The Bear,"" in which Isaac McCaslin becomes a master hunter and, with the group of older hunters at Major de Spain's camp, tracks Old Ben, a giant bear; later, his experiences cause him to repudiate his birthright and refuse the inheritance of the McCaslin plantation, out of a belief that no man can own the land.
""Delta Autumn,"" in which Isaac McCaslin, now an old man, goes on a final hunting trip to the Mississippi River Delta, where he meets a young woman who has had Carothers Edmonds's child.
""Go Down, Moses,"" in which Gavin Stevens, the Jefferson district attorney, helps Molly Beauchamp acquire the body of her executed grandson."
Purse,"Bilbo Baggins lives a quiet, peaceful life in his comfortable hole at Bag End. Bilbo lives in a hole because he is a hobbit—one of a race of small, plump people about half the size of humans, with furry toes and a great love of good food and drink. Bilbo is quite content at Bag End, near the bustling hobbit village of Hobbiton, but one day his comfort is shattered by the arrival of the old wizard Gandalf, who persuades Bilbo to set out on an adventure with a group of thirteen militant dwarves. The dwarves are embarking on a great quest to reclaim their treasure from the marauding dragon Smaug, and Bilbo is to act as their “burglar.” The dwarves are very skeptical about Gandalf’s choice for a burglar, and Bilbo is terrified to leave his comfortable life to seek adventure. But Gandalf assures both Bilbo and the dwarves that there is more to the little hobbit than meets the eye.
Shortly after the group sets out, three hungry trolls capture all of them except for Gandalf. Gandalf tricks the trolls into remaining outside when the sun comes up, and the sunlight turns the nocturnal trolls to stone. The group finds a great cache of weapons in the trolls’ camp. Gandalf and the dwarf lord Thorin take magic swords, and Bilbo takes a small sword of his own.
The group rests at the elfish stronghold of Rivendell, where they receive advice from the great elf lord Elrond, then sets out to cross the Misty Mountains. When they find shelter in a cave during a snowstorm, a group of goblins who live in the caverns beneath the mountain take them prisoner. Gandalf leads the dwarves to a passage out of the mountain, but they accidentally leave behind Bilbo.
Wandering through the tunnels, Bilbo finds a strange golden ring lying on the ground. He takes the ring and puts it in his pocket. Soon he encounters Gollum, a hissing, whining creature who lives in a pool in the caverns and hunts fish and goblins. Gollum wants to eat Bilbo, and the two have a contest of riddles to determine Bilbo’s fate. Bilbo wins by asking the dubious riddle, “What have I got in my pocket?”
Gollum wants to eat Bilbo anyway, and he disappears to fetch his magic ring, which turns its wearer invisible. The ring, however, is the same one Bilbo has already found, and Bilbo uses it to escape from Gollum and flee the goblins. He finds a tunnel leading up out of the mountain and discovers that the dwarves and Gandalf have already escaped. Evil wolves known as Wargs pursue them, but Bilbo and his comrades are helped to safety by a group of great eagles and by Beorn, a creature who can change shape from a man into a bear.
The company enters the dark forest of Mirkwood, and, making matters worse, Gandalf abandons them to see to some other urgent business. In the forest, the dwarves are caught in the webs of some giant spiders, and Bilbo must rescue them with his sword and magic ring. After slaying his first spider, Bilbo names his sword Sting. Shortly after escaping the spiders, the unlucky dwarves are captured by a group of wood elves who live near the river that runs through Mirkwood. Bilbo uses his ring to help the company escape and slips the dwarves away from the elves by hiding them inside barrels, which he then floats down the river. The dwarves arrive at Lake Town, a human settlement near the Lonely Mountain, under which the great dragon sleeps with Thorin’s treasure.
After sneaking into the mountain, Bilbo talks to the sly dragon Smaug, who unwittingly reveals that his armorlike scales have a weak spot near his heart. When Bilbo steals a golden cup from the dragon’s hoard, Smaug is furious and flies out of the mountain to burn Lake Town in his rage. Bard, a heroic archer, has learned the secret about Smaug’s weakness from a thrush, and he fires an arrow into the dragon’s heart, killing him. Before Smaug dies, however, he burns Lake Town to the ground. 
The humans of Lake Town and the elves of Mirkwood march to the Lonely Mountain to seek a share of the treasure as compensation for their losses and aid, but Thorin greedily refuses, and the humans and elves besiege the mountain, trapping the dwarves and the hobbit inside. Bilbo sneaks out to join the humans in an attempt to bring peace. When Thorin learns what Bilbo has done, he is livid, but Gandalf suddenly reappears and saves Bilbo from the dwarf lord’s wrath.
At this moment, an army of goblins and Wargs marches on the mountain, and the humans, elves, and dwarves are forced to band together to defeat them. The goblins nearly win, but the arrival of Beorn and the eagles helps the good armies win the battle.
After the battle, Bilbo and Gandalf return to Hobbiton, where Bilbo continues to live. He is no longer accepted by respectable hobbit society, but he does not care. Bilbo now prefers to talk to elves and wizards, and he is deeply content to be back among the familiar comforts of home after his grand and harrowing adventures."
Easing,"Obi Okonkwo is a young man, about twenty-six years old, who returns to Nigeria after studying in England at a university for four years. No Longer At Ease, begins with a trial against Obi that takes place a while after his return, and the novel then works its way backward to explain how Obi has come to be charged with accepting a bribe.
The Umuofia Progressive Union (U.P.U.) has given Obi a scholarship to study law in England, a scholarship that Obi has to pay back upon his return. And, thus, he leaves for England, stopping in Lagos on the way out. While in England, several things happen to him. First, he changes his course of study to English and abandons law. Secondly, he finds himself nostalgic for home, writing poems about Nigeria. Finally, he meets a girl named Clara at a dance in London but fails to make a good impression. However, the girl is Nigerian also, and on Obi's boat ride back home, after nearly four years in England, he meets Clara once again. This time, they begin a relationship.
Once back in Nigeria, Obi stays, once again, in Lagos with his friend Joseph, trying to find a job and a place of his own. He also visits his own home village of Umuofia. Obi is quickly given a post on the Scholarship Board of the Civil Service and is also quickly introduced to the world of bribery, which is a world he wholeheartedly rejects with a strong idealism at first. This is indicated early on when a man offers Obi money in order for Obi to ""pull strings"" for his little sister's scholarship. Obi is appalled and rejects the offer, only later to be met at home by the little sister herself who offers Obi her body in return for the scholarship favor. Again, Obi rejects this offer.
Although Obi begins his life in Nigeria in an honest way, events do not go as he has planned. First, Clara tells him that she cannot marry him because she is an osu, an outcast. Obi decides to ignore this and go against what most of his fellow countrymen believe to be a major transgression of custom, and he decides he will marry her anyway. Still, his economic hardship worsens, given that he has to send money home and that he is in debt. Obi then receives a letter from his father telling him that he must go home. When he arrives at home he sees that his mother is very ill. And, his parents tell him he must not marry Clara because she is an osu. In fact, Obi's dying mother gives him an ultimatum: she tells him that if he insists on marrying Clara, he must wait until she is dead because if he marries Clara while she is alive, she will kill herself.
Obi, therefore returns back to Lagos and tells Clara all that has transpired. Clara becomes angry and breaks off the engagement, afterwards hinting at the fact that she is pregnant. It is at this point when Obi arranges an abortion. He does not have the money and needs to borrow it. Complications arise out of the operation, and Clara is hospitalized, after which she refuses to see Obi.
Obi then returns to work, only to be notified that his mother has died. He does not go home for the funeral, and the U.P.U. discusses this failure on Obi's behalf as a sign of his not having cared about his mother's death. The truth, however, is that he was terribly saddened by her death, feels terrible remorse and guilt, and has entered into a state of mental unrest. However, Obi awakes from this unrest with a new sense of calm. He feels like a new man, and it is at this point that he takes his first bribe, not without a certain degree of guilt.
Obi allows this acceptance of bribes to become habitual. He continues to take bribes until the end of the novel, when Obi decides he cannot stand it anymore. He has paid off all of his debts and can no longer be a part of the corruption. It is at this moment, however, when he has taken his last bribe, that he is caught, which brings us back to the beginning of the novel."
Dealt,"The protagonist, who is named Tim O’Brien, begins by describing an event that occurred in the middle of his Vietnam experience. “The Things They Carried” catalogs the variety of things his fellow soldiers in the Alpha Company brought on their missions. Several of these things are intangible, including guilt and fear, while others are specific physical objects, including matches, morphine, M-16 rifles, and M&M’s candy.
Throughout the collection, the same characters reappear in various stories. The first member of the Alpha Company to die is Ted Lavender, a “grunt,” or low-ranking soldier, who deals with his anxiety about the war by taking tranquilizers and smoking marijuana. Lavender is shot in the head on his way back from going to the bathroom, and his superior, Lieutenant Jimmy Cross, blames himself for the tragedy. When Lavender is shot, Cross is distracting himself with thoughts of Martha, a college crush. It is revealed in “Love” that Cross’s feelings for Martha, whom he dated once before leaving for Vietnam, were never reciprocated, and that even twenty years after the war, his guilt over Lavender’s death remains.
In “On the Rainy River,” the narrator, O’Brien, explains the series of events that led him to Vietnam in the first place. He receives his draft notice in June of 1968, and his feelings of confusion drive him north to the Canadian border, which he contemplates crossing so that he will not be forced to fight in a war in which he doesn’t believe. Sitting in a rowboat with the proprietor of the Tip Top Lodge, where he stays, O’Brien decides that his guilt about avoiding the war and fear of disappointing his family are more important than his political convictions. He soon leaves, going first back home to Worthington, Minnesota and later to Vietnam.
In addition to Ted Lavender, a few other members of the Alpha Company are killed during their mission overseas, including Curt Lemon, who is killed when he steps on a rigged mortar round. Though O’Brien is not close to Lemon, in “The Dentist,” he tells a story of how Lemon, who faints before a routine checkup with an army-issued dentist, tries to save face by insisting that a perfectly good tooth be pulled. Lee Strunk, another member of the company, dies from injuries he sustains by stepping on a landmine. In “Friends,” O’Brien remembers that before Strunk was fatally hurt, Strunk and Dave Jensen had made a pact that if either man were irreparably harmed, the other man would see that he was quickly killed. However, when Strunk is actually hurt, he begs Jensen to spare him, and Jensen complies. Instead of being upset by the news of his friend’s swift death en route to treatment, Jensen is relieved.
The death that receives the most attention in The Things They Carried is that of Kiowa, a much-loved member of the Alpha Company and one of O’Brien’s closest friends. In “Speaking of Courage,” the story of Kiowa’s death is relayed in retrospect through the memory of Norman Bowker, years after the war. As Bowker drives around a lake in his Iowa hometown, he thinks that he failed to save Kiowa, who was killed when a mortar round hit and caused him to sink headfirst into a marshy field. O’Brien realizes that he has dealt with his guilt over Kiowa’s death differently than Norman Bowker in “Notes.” Just before the end of the war, O’Brien receives a long letter from Bowker that says he hasn’t found a way to make life meaningful after the war. O’Brien resolves to tell Bowker’s story, and the story of Kiowa’s death, in order to negotiate his own feelings of guilt and hollowness.
Like “Love” and “Notes,” several of O’Brien’s stories are told from a perspective twenty years after the Vietnam War, when he is a forty-three-year-old writer living in Massachusetts. Exposure to the guilt of old friends like Jimmy Cross and Norman Bowker prompts him to write stories in order to understand what they were going through. But two stories, “The Man I Killed” and “Ambush,” are written so that O’Brien can confront his own guilt over killing a man with a grenade outside the village of My Khe. In “The Man I Killed,” O’Brien imagines the life of his victim, from his childhood to the way things would have turned out for him had O’Brien not spotted him on a path and thrown a grenade at his feet. In “Ambush,” O’Brien imagines how he might relay the story of the man he killed to his nine-year-old daughter, Kathleen. In this second story, O’Brien provides more details of the actual killing—including the sound of the grenade and his own feelings—and explains that even well after the fact, he hasn’t finished sorting out the experience.
In the last story, “The Lives of the Dead,” O’Brien gives another twist to his contention that stories have the power to save people. In the stories of Curt Lemon and Kiowa, O’Brien explains that his imagination allowed him to grapple successfully with his guilt and confusion over the death of his fourth-grade first love, Linda."
Deeds,"Don Quixote is a middle-aged gentleman from the region of La Mancha in central Spain. Obsessed with the chivalrous ideals touted in books he has read, he decides to take up his lance and sword to defend the helpless and destroy the wicked. After a first failed adventure, he sets out on a second one with a somewhat befuddled laborer named Sancho Panza, whom he has persuaded to accompany him as his faithful squire. In return for Sancho’s services, Don Quixote promises to make Sancho the wealthy governor of an isle. On his horse, Rocinante, a barn nag well past his prime, Don Quixote rides the roads of Spain in search of glory and grand adventure. He gives up food, shelter, and comfort, all in the name of a peasant woman, Dulcinea del Toboso, whom he envisions as a princess.
On his second expedition, Don Quixote becomes more of a bandit than a savior, stealing from and hurting baffled and justifiably angry citizens while acting out against what he perceives as threats to his knighthood or to the world. Don Quixote abandons a boy, leaving him in the hands of an evil farmer simply because the farmer swears an oath that he will not harm the boy. He steals a barber’s basin that he believes to be the mythic Mambrino’s helmet, and he becomes convinced of the healing powers of the Balsam of Fierbras, an elixir that makes him so ill that, by comparison, he later feels healed. Sancho stands by Don Quixote, often bearing the brunt of the punishments that arise from Don Quixote’s behavior.
The story of Don Quixote’s deeds includes the stories of those he meets on his journey. Don Quixote witnesses the funeral of a student who dies as a result of his love for a disdainful lady turned shepherdess. He frees a wicked and devious galley slave, Gines de Pasamonte, and unwittingly reunites two bereaved couples, Cardenio and Lucinda, and Ferdinand and Dorothea. Torn apart by Ferdinand’s treachery, the four lovers finally come together at an inn where Don Quixote sleeps, dreaming that he is battling a giant.
Along the way, the simple Sancho plays the straight man to Don Quixote, trying his best to correct his master’s outlandish fantasies. Two of Don Quixote’s friends, the priest and the barber, come to drag him home. Believing that he is under the force of an enchantment, he accompanies them, thus ending his second expedition and the First Part of the novel.
The Second Part of the novel begins with a passionate invective against a phony sequel of Don Quixote that was published in the interim between Cervantes’s two parts. Everywhere Don Quixote goes, his reputation—gleaned by others from both the real and the false versions of the story—precedes him.
As the two embark on their journey, Sancho lies to Don Quixote, telling him that an evil enchanter has transformed Dulcinea into a peasant girl. Undoing this enchantment, in which even Sancho comes to believe, becomes Don Quixote’s chief goal.
Don Quixote meets a Duke and Duchess who conspire to play tricks on him. They make a servant dress up as Merlin, for example, and tell Don Quixote that Dulcinea’s enchantment—which they know to be a hoax—can be undone only if Sancho whips himself 3,300 times on his naked backside. Under the watch of the Duke and Duchess, Don Quixote and Sancho undertake several adventures. They set out on a flying wooden horse, hoping to slay a giant who has turned a princess and her lover into metal figurines and bearded the princess’s female servants.
During his stay with the Duke, Sancho becomes governor of a fictitious isle. He rules for ten days until he is wounded in an onslaught the Duke and Duchess sponsor for their entertainment. Sancho reasons that it is better to be a happy laborer than a miserable governor.
A young maid at the Duchess’s home falls in love with Don Quixote, but he remains a staunch worshipper of Dulcinea. Their never-consummated affair amuses the court to no end. Finally, Don Quixote sets out again on his journey, but his demise comes quickly. Shortly after his arrival in Barcelona, the Knight of the White Moon—actually an old friend in disguise—vanquishes him.
Cervantes relates the story of Don Quixote as a history, which he claims he has translated from a manuscript written by a Moor named Cide Hamete Benengeli. Cervantes becomes a party to his own fiction, even allowing Sancho and Don Quixote to modify their own histories and comment negatively upon the false history published in their names.
In the end, the beaten and battered Don Quixote forswears all the chivalric truths he followed so fervently and dies from a fever. With his death, knights-errant become extinct. Benengeli returns at the end of the novel to tell us that illustrating the demise of chivalry was his main purpose in writing the history of Don Quixote."
He,"Hannah Hall, a professional woodturner living in California, receives a short cryptic note from her husband Owen Michaels, telling her to protect his teenage daughter Bailey. The message puzzles Hannah, but she soon learns that Owen has disappeared in the wake of legal raids at The Shop, the tech company where he works. He also leaves a note for Bailey, as well as a duffel bag full of money. Hannah tells no one about the notes or the money, and everyone assumes that Owen fled because he is guilty. The assessment of Owen that emerges from these events diverges from the image of the good and honest man Hannah married. Visits from federal authorities, including a US Marshal named Grady Bradford, confuse and panic her. Meanwhile, at home, Owen’s disappearance exacerbates her tense relationship with Bailey, who is furious at her father for leaving and more distant and dismissive than usual toward Hannah. 
Interspersed with Hannah’s narration about present events are flashbacks to her courtship with Owen. She recalls the sincerity of their connection and how they bonded over her work, as well as more recent memories of their married life. Her recollections of Owen show a man who loves his wife and daughter, although he is sometimes distant and avoids talking about his past and his work. Once Owen disappears, though, these memories take on new meaning, and the two women increasingly scrutinize what they know, or thought they knew, about Owen. Various clues suggest that Austin, Texas, might have played a role in Owen’s mysterious past, and Hannah increasingly believes that whatever he is fleeing from involves Austin rather than the criminal activity at The Shop. She is also convinced he disappeared to protect his daughter, not himself. 
Hannah takes Bailey to Austin in the hopes that they can learn more. Hannah hopes that visiting the city will trigger Bailey’s early memories, giving them additional clues about what happened in the past and what is happening in the present. Once there, however, Hannah and Bailey find it difficult to gather the information they need. What they know seems uncharacteristic of Owen, and Bailey’s memories remain fragmentary. Tensions erupt as Bailey antagonizes both Hannah and the friendly strangers they meet in Austin. She confronts Hannah about lying to her and extracts a promise that they will be honest with each other in the future. The two visit the University of Texas football stadium, and Bailey feels that she has been there before. They both hope the nearby Episcopal church that Bailey recognizes will provide some answers, but Elenor, the church secretary, denies that a wedding could have taken place in 2008 during the timeframe they provide. 
Hannah receives a call from Jake, a New York attorney and her former fiancé, who tells her that Owen Michaels does not exist. The information Owen shared about his background matches no known person, and he only appears in 2009. The women find this news deeply distressing, although Hannah believes that some details of Owen’s previous life exist amidst the fictions he created. His favorite college anecdote leads them to University of Texas professor Tobias Cookman. As Hannah and Bailey work through one of Tobias’s class rosters, Elenor calls to confirm that the wedding Bailey remembers did indeed occur, just earlier than they had assumed. During their research, they stumble on Katherine Smith, a classmate of Owen’s who bears an eerie resemblance to Bailey. They surmise that this woman is Bailey’s mother. 
Hannah and Bailey go to the Never Dry, a bar with a connection to Katherine. Hannah refuses to let Bailey come into the bar until they know more. At the Never Dry, she meets the owner, Charlie, and learns that Katherine is his late sister. When Hannah shows him a picture of Owen, Charlie explodes in rage. Bailey rushes in and, startled, Charlie calls her Kristin. Shaken, the women flee the bar and return to their hotel room. Hannah pieces together that Katherine had been married to Owen, then known as Ethan, and that Bailey, born Kristin, is indeed Katherine’s daughter. She also learns why Ethan became Owen. Criminal associates of Katherine’s father Nicholas, a corrupt attorney, killed her, which led Ethan to provide evidence against Nicholas that helped to send him to prison. Fearing for his daughter’s safety, Ethan changed their identities and moved to California. Hannah realizes Bailey has run away from their hotel room while she was piecing together this information.  
Grady arrives and dispatches agents to find Bailey. While they wait, he tries to convince Hannah that their safety demands that she and Bailey enter witness protection. Hannah rejects his offer, arguing that for Bailey to change her identity now will destroy her given how much she has already lost. After confirming that a piggy bank on which Owen seemed focused contained his real will, Hannah returns to the Never Dry and convinces Charlie to take her to Nicholas at his house outside Austin. During a tense negotiation, Nicholas agrees to allow Hannah and Bailey to live openly in safety—but categorically refuses to extend the same offer to Owen. Hannah and Bailey reunite at the Marshals’ office. Hannah keeps her promise not to lie to Bailey and asks her what she wants to do. Bailey chooses to go home to California with Hannah, knowing that she will not see Owen for a long time. The novel’s ending, set a few years later, reveals that Hannah and Bailey have become very close, conveyed clearly when Bailey calls Hannah “Mom.” Owen is still in hiding, even from his family, but he briefly appears at one of Hannah’s exhibitions, wearing his wedding ring. Hannah is reassured that he is the good man she always believed him to be, but, as she turns to Bailey, the novel shows that her relationship with her daughter is now the most important one in her life."
Measure,"Thomas wakes up in a swaying elevator, and the only thing he can remember is his first name. The elevator, called the Box, opens up, and a group of boys lower a rope for Thomas and pull him out. The boys live in a place called the Glade, a courtyard which is surrounded by an enormous labyrinth of 100-foot stone walls called the Maze. Alby, a dark-skinned boy who has been there the longest, is the leader, and his sidekick is a blond boy named Newt. For the past two years, a new boy has appeared in the Box every month. Thomas, confused and upset, demands an explanation about where he is and what’s going on, but when screams sound from a nearby building, the boys leave him with the young, pudgy Chuck, who will become like a brother to Thomas.
The screams are from a boy named Ben; he was stung by a Griever, one of the monsters that lives in the Maze. After receiving an antidote called Grief Serum, Ben is going through “the Changing,” a painful process during which the victim is flooded with memories of his life before the Maze. Gally, a bully who went through the Changing and recovered, confronts Thomas, saying that he saw Thomas during his Changing and doesn’t trust him.
Before dark, four boy run out through four “Doors” in the walls of the Maze, the walls sliding closed behind them. Chuck tells Thomas that these are the Maze Runners, and Thomas feels drawn to become one. The Runners are trying to find a way out of the Maze, and each night, in a concrete room, they map out the eight sections of the Maze. But the internal walls shift every night, creating multiple variations of the Maze, and, so far, they haven’t been able to identify an escape route. 
Before dawn the next morning, Newt shows Thomas a Griever through a window in one of the walls. It’s a “horrifying mix of animal and machine,” an enormous monster with metal arms that are capped with saws and shears. Grievers patrol the Maze at night, stinging any boy unlucky enough to be there. Alby explains that the Glade is divided into four areas: the Gardens, where they grow food, the Blood House, where they raise and butcher animals, the Homestead, where they live, and the Deadheads forest, which serves as a graveyard.
An alarm blares out through the Glade, and, for the first time ever, a girl arrives in the Box. She babbles incoherently and then falls into a coma, holding a note reading that reads, “She’s the last one. Ever.” The girl seems familiar to Thomas, but he doesn’t know why. Later, Thomas sees a metal beetle engraved with the word WICKED; the beetle is a spy from the Creators of the Maze. Thomas goes into the Deadheads forest, where he is attacked by a delirious Ben. Before Ben can stab Thomas, Alby shoots an arrow through Ben’s face, wounding but not killing him.
While Thomas is working in the Blood House, he sees an Asian Runner collapse on the lawn. This Runner, Minho, tells Alby and Thomas that he found a dead Griever in the Maze. At dusk, the leaders, called Keepers, bring Ben from prison and push him into the Maze for attempting to murder Thomas. Ben shrieks and howls in terror as the walls close on him.
The next day, Minho and Alby go into the Maze to find the Griever, who, it turns out, was only pretending to be dead. By dinner, they haven’t returned. At the West Door, Thomas sees Minho half-carrying Alby, who has been stung. When Thomas realizes that they won’t make it into the Glade before the Doors close, he jumps into the Maze to help them.
Thomas secures himself and Alby high onto the wall with ivy ropes. A Griever appears, pursues Thomas, and is joined by three Grievers. Using an evasive maneuver, Minho and Thomas trick the Grievers into going off a cliff within the Maze, where they are instantly swallowed up by darkness. 
The next day, Alby is still alive on the wall, and he is taken down by other Gladers and given the Grief Serum. The Keepers are divided on what to do about Thomas: he violated the rules by entering the Maze, but he also saved Alby’s life. Minho and Gally fight over Thomas’ fate, and it’s finally decided that Thomas will spend the next day in the Slammer (the Glade’s jail), then join Minho as a Runner.
Word comes that Alby is awake and that he wants to talk to Thomas alone. Alby tells Thomas that during the Changing he learned some disturbing things about Thomas and the girl, and that he knows about “the Flare,” which means nothing to Thomas. Just as Alby is explain further, he starts to strangle himself. After Alby is restrained with Newt’s help, he says that an outside force was in control of his hands. Alby then gives Newt two instructions: “Be careful with the girl,” and “protect the Maps.”
When Thomas visits the girl, she tells him telepathically that her name is Teresa. In her coma, she still has memories and says she and Thomas caused this and were sent to end it. Thomas retreats to sleep in the south corner of the Deadheads.
After his day in jail, Thomas joins Minho. They run through Sections Eight and One of the Maze, then draw maps of those sections and add them to a trunk holding all the other daily maps. The other Runners do the same. That night, Teresa telepathically tells Thomas she has “triggered the Ending.” 
The next morning, the boys wake up to find that the sun has disappeared and the Glade is bathed in grey light. More disturbing is the fact that the walls of the Maze are now stuck in the open position, meaning that there’s nothing protecting the Glade from Grievers. Back in the Maze, Thomas and Minho follow a Griever, and when they see it throw itself off the cliff, they realize there’s a hole through which Grievers enter and exit the Maze. Teresa wakes up, and she and Thomas, who have a connection they don’t fully understand, speak to each other telepathically. Teresa is locked in the Slammer, and everyone else prepares for the Grievers to come through the open Maze doors into the Glade. 
Barricaded in a Homestead room, Newt, Alby, Minho, and Thomas hear the Grievers approach. Alby, very troubled, runs to the Map room. Gally bursts in and says the Grievers will kill one Glader each night until they’re all dead. As a Griever breaks through the window, Gally throws himself at it. The Griever takes Gally through the West Door and the other Grievers follow.
Alby has burned the Maps, but it turns out that Minho had already moved the real Maps to protect them. Teresa realizes that the Maps are a code, and that by stacking each day’s eight maps together, they can read letters, one letter each day. The Maps spell out six repeating words: FLOAT, CATCH, BLEED, DEATH, STIFF, PUSH. To gain more information, Thomas intentionally gets stung by a Griever, goes through the Changing, and realizes in his visions that the only way to escape the Maze is to jump into the Griever Hole and type in the code words. 
After a Gathering, the Keepers agree to the dangerous plan, and about half the Gladers assemble to escape. In the Maze, they’re surrounded by Grievers, but they fight valiantly to make a path for Thomas, Teresa, and Chuck to get to the Cliff. The three make it through the Hole and land in a greasy tunnel. Teresa types the words into a computer while Thomas fights, and kills, a Griever. The last word, PUSH, won’t enter, and Chuck realizes they need to push a button marked “Kill the Maze.” 
Thomas, Teresa, and Chuck by the eighteen surviving Gladers, including Newt and Minho, and they go down a winding slide, landing in an enormous lab. Ghostly scientists observe them. A woman enters the room with a boy who reveals himself to be Gally. Gally throws a knife at Thomas, but Chuck steps in to protect him and is killed. As Thomas grieves Chuck, an armed group arrives. They shoot the woman and scientists and lead the Gladers to a bus. 
One of the rescuers explains to Thomas that the world was burned up by a series of solar flares and then consumed by a disease they call the Flare. It’s rumored that there’s a cure in the Andes, and WICKED, the Creators’ organization, was testing orphaned children to see if they were tenacious enough to try and recover the cure. The Gladers are taken to a bright dormitory and given pizza, after which they fall asleep. 
A memo reveals that the woman in the lab, Ava Paige, was not actually killed, and that the “rescuers” are actually a part of the WICKED plan. WICKED will give the survivors, called Group A, one night’s sleep before sending them on the next part of the experiment. Another group, Group B, is reported to also have performed well."
Die,"When the Legends Die traces the life path of the novel's protagonist Thomas Black Bull, a Native American Ute from Southwestern Colorado. As a young boy, Tom lives with his mother Bessie and his father George Black Bull in Pagosa. However, when George Black Bull kills Frank No Deer for having repeatedly stolen money from him, the family must flee the town. Returning to the wilderness, they live happily in the old Ute way. One winter day, an avalanche kills Tom's father as he hunts in a valley. Tom adopts the name ""Bear's Brother,"" as well as the role of the man of the family. When Bessie returns to Pagosa to visit the general store, she learns that her husband's name has been cleared but still hesitates to move back into town. The following winter, Bessie becomes ill and dies. Living alone in the wilderness, Tom befriends many animals and becomes particularly close to a bear cub whom he considers his closest friend and his brother.
When another Ute, Blue Elk, approaches Tom, allegedly to encourage him to spread knowledge of the old Ute ways to the townspeople of Pagosa, Tom agrees to travel there. His bear accompanies him on his journey. However, Blue Elk forces Tom to attend the local reservation school, where Tom becomes angry and depressed, and where the teachers chain the bear to a fence. Blue Elk soon tricks Tom into believing he will be released, but they journey into the mountains solely to release the bear. After numerous unappealing classes and jobs, Tom meets a man named Red Dillon during a trip to the town of Bayfield. Red, impressed with Tom's ability to ride a wild bronco, convinces him to return to his ranch with him to better his riding skills.
After some training at Red's ranch, Tom and Red travel to countless rodeo competitions, at which Tom demonstrates his skill. But, Tom must obey Red's instructions to ride in a way that will benefit Red's betting efforts. Over the years, Tom becomes increasingly frustrated with Red's control over him, as well as Red's drunken and obnoxious behavior, and soon Tom asserts his independence from Red. After his competition has finished, Tom drives Red back to his ranch. In the fall Red wants to take a trip with Tom, but Tom refuses to accompany him; nonetheless, Red soon departs. A stranger comes to Red's ranch to inform his Mexican cook, Meo, and Tom that Red has become very ill. Rushing to his aid, Tom travels to the hotel where Red is staying in order to care for him. However, Tom cannot even carry Red to the car before Red dies in Tom's arms.
Returning to his rodeo life, Tom enters the professional circuit, where he continues to exhibit his skill and brutality, developing a reputation as ""Killer Tom Black."" When Tom returns to Red's old ranch to visit Meo, Meo shows little interest in conversation and seems to act oddly; Tom leaves promising to return shortly. During a particularly brutal ride Tom breaks his arm, and leaves the hospital to visit Meo once again. Arriving at the cabin, Tom finds Meo absent and later learns from a doctor in town that Meo has died a few weeks prior. He falls into an even deeper despair, having lost many people in his life. His riding style becomes increasingly abusive, and his social behavior increasingly reclusive. During a ride at the Garden in New York City, Tom becomes seriously injured in a fall. Nursing his injuries at the hospital, Tom receives advice from his doctor that he should never ride again, but he remains determined to return to the ring. His nurse Mary Redmond treats him with care and kindness, but he resents her efforts and believes she simply wants to control his life, as so many other individuals have tried before her. Having regained his ability to walk after significant efforts, Tom leaves the hospital with only a curt goodbye from Mary. He heads west on a train to his homeland.
In Pagosa, Tom feels self-conscious and assaulted by many memories of his younger life there. In the general store, he meets Jim Woodward, who offers him a job as a shepherd in the mountains. He decides to work as a shepherd for a while. During his time in the mountains, Tom has the necessary time and space for his thoughts. Contemplating his past and the meaning of his life, Tom first begins to recognize his poor treatment of both animals and other people. He also begins to process his painful memories and to come to terms with them. One day a bear emerges from the woods and kills one of the sheep; Tom reacts by yelling at it to run away. Later he regrets not having killed the bear and regards his hesitation to shoot it as foolish. Returning to town with Jim, Tom gathers supplies at the hardware store before packing his bag and heading back up to Horse Mountain unobserved. There he intends to kill the bear that has killed the lamb. However, when he finally spots the bear once again, he aims his rifle at it but finds he cannot pull the trigger. In his dreams the All-Mother appears and defends him from the fury of nature's element, claiming Tom as her son. Tom leaves the bear alone and engages in the old Ute ways. The novel ends with his contentment in his solitary life in the wilderness and in the ways of his heritage."
Overthrown,"Marjane “Marji” Satrapi is an intelligent, spirited, and very modern girl living with her parents in Iran’s capital of Tehran during the eventful period of Iranian history from the late 1970s into the early 1980s. In Persepolis: The Story of a Childhood, Marji’s remembers her life during those years, mostly from when she was about ten to age fourteen. This account includes how Marji and her family lived through and were affected by turbulent events that included the overthrow of the autocratic Shah of Iran by the Islamic revolution, the oppressive fundamentalist regime that replaced the Shah, and the devasting Iran-Iraq war.
The nation’s wealth has long made it a target of outside invaders, but Islamic revolution of 1979 has pushed out the Western-backed government of the Shah.  The revolution has ushered in a new Islamic regime that is bringing massive societal changes impacting how people are supposed to behave--including Marji and her family. Marji struggles to adjust to the changes at her liberal French bilingual school, which has become increasingly stricter. Girls are required to wear veils and female and male students are now separated. Marji’s wealthy and modern parents—her father, Ebi, and her mother, Taji—take part in the massive protests against the new regime’s strict rules on behavior (just as they had previously protested against the Shah’s regime). Marji’s parents worry when a photo of Marji’s mother a protest appears in newspapers magazines. Later, after a demonstration they are at turns violent, the Satrapis decide that openly protesting is too dangerous to continue to do.
Marji feels conflict between her own deeply spiritual feelings and the stark modernism of her parents. She talks to God at night and has believed she will become a prophet one day since she was six years old, Marji. But the revolution leads to Marji setting aside these ambitions while she studies and imitates protestors and revolutionaries. She mimics protestors in the garden of her house and studies books about famous revolutionaries and philosophers given to her by her parents. She fantasizes about becoming a hero and wants her parents to become heroes too. Marji’s relationship with God becomes strained, as she finds that she and God have less to talk about—although God does still come by to see her from time to time.
Marji thrills when she learns that rebels fill her family history. She learns that her grandfather was a prince and later a communist whom the Shah removed from power and that her uncle Anoosh, also a communist, spent nine years in prison during the Shah’s regime. Marji spends a short time with Anoosh, learning about his life. After the Shah fell from power in 1979, Anoosh was released from prison, but when Islamic fundamentalists consolidate their grip on power, they hunt Anoosh down, imprison him, and later execute him. Her new idol killed, Marji feels crushed. She completely abandons her faith in God and increasingly questions the pro-regime propaganda she hears—especially at school.
Marji deeply loves and identifies with of her parents, even if she does sometimes feel that their actions and behavior (as wealthy and privileged individuals) do not always live up to their pro-democratic and liberal rhetoric. Marji also has a special connection with her grandmother, who remains stoic and inspiring to Marji in spite of the turmoil and numerous tragedies stemming from political actions that impact her and the family. Marji’s uncle Anoosh is not Marji’s only direct experience with the cruel consequences of the government’s actions. Throughout the book, death and devastation occurs among Marji’s extended family and friends as direct results of the brutality and fanaticism of the Iranian regimes and the war with Iraq.
People had rejoiced when the Shah was forced out, but as Islamic fundamentalists retain power, Marji and her family watch as their neighbors’ behavior shifts back and forth to coincide with the current political winds. The neighbors go from wearing short skirts and drinking alcohol to covering themselves and denouncing the use of alcohol. Marji’s parents ask her to tell everyone that she prays every day, a lie they hope will keep Marji safe, but acknowledge that the rules seem foolish. Marji grows more rebellious, as she increasingly views the rules at school and elsewhere as hypocritical and difficult to follow. Armed with more knowledge and personal experience, Marji begins to act out in ways that put her safety at risk. In fact, she even (accidentally) hits her principal during an argument, which results in her expulsion from school. Fearing her rebellious behavior will get her killed, Marji’s mother tries to reason with Marji by telling her that it is not her responsibility to serve justice and that the bad guys eventually pay for their sins in the end.
The war with Iraq had originally inspired Marji to vocal patriotism in protection her country against another invasion, but Marji begins to realize there are greater forces behind the war. She sees how the Islamic regime needs the war to continue survive and keep power. The war promotes a sense of nationalism and pride in the public, and those who die in the war are hailed as “martyrs.” Marji sees thousands of poor boys lured into war without proper training. She becomes increasingly uncomfortable and aware of class differences within society. Poor young boys are lured into the army with gold-painted keys to the “kingdom of heaven” to help them enter paradise after dying on the battlefield, while children in her wealthy neighborhood are left alone.
More and more people try to escape Iran as the borders tighten and Iraqi forces bomb Tehran and other Iranian cities. Realizing that Marji’s chances of escaping Iran are narrowing, her parents make the difficult decision to send her abroad alone to finish school in Vienna, explaining that only a good education will free her of Iran. Marji feels heartbroken. She spends one last night with her grandmother, who gives her warm advice and inspires her to be compassionate and understanding while in Vienna. Marji gives away all of her prized contraband to her friends, including a Kim Wilde poster. At the airport, as Marji turns to say goodbye to her parents one last time to see that her mother, devasted by her only child’s departure, has fainted."
If,"In the midst of a raging war, a plane evacuating a group of schoolboys from Britain is shot down over a deserted tropical island. Two of the boys, Ralph and Piggy, discover a conch shell on the beach, and Piggy realizes it could be used as a horn to summon the other boys. Once assembled, the boys set about electing a leader and devising a way to be rescued. They choose Ralph as their leader, and Ralph appoints another boy, Jack, to be in charge of the boys who will hunt food for the entire group.
Ralph, Jack, and another boy, Simon, set off on an expedition to explore the island. When they return, Ralph declares that they must light a signal fire to attract the attention of passing ships. The boys succeed in igniting some dead wood by focusing sunlight through the lenses of Piggy’s eyeglasses. However, the boys pay more attention to playing than to monitoring the fire, and the flames quickly engulf the forest. A large swath of dead wood burns out of control, and one of the youngest boys in the group disappears, presumably having burned to death.
At first, the boys enjoy their life without grown-ups and spend much of their time splashing in the water and playing games. Ralph, however, complains that they should be maintaining the signal fire and building huts for shelter. The hunters fail in their attempt to catch a wild pig, but their leader, Jack, becomes increasingly preoccupied with the act of hunting.
When a ship passes by on the horizon one day, Ralph and Piggy notice, to their horror, that the signal fire—which had been the hunters’ responsibility to maintain—has burned out. Furious, Ralph accosts Jack, but the hunter has just returned with his first kill, and all the hunters seem gripped with a strange frenzy, reenacting the chase in a kind of wild dance. Piggy criticizes Jack, who hits Piggy across the face. Ralph blows the conch shell and reprimands the boys in a speech intended to restore order. At the meeting, it quickly becomes clear that some of the boys have started to become afraid. The littlest boys, known as “littluns,” have been troubled by nightmares from the beginning, and more and more boys now believe that there is some sort of beast or monster lurking on the island. The older boys try to convince the others at the meeting to think rationally, asking where such a monster could possibly hide during the daytime. One of the littluns suggests that it hides in the sea—a proposition that terrifies the entire group.
Not long after the meeting, some military planes engage in a battle high above the island. The boys, asleep below, do not notice the flashing lights and explosions in the clouds. A parachutist drifts to earth on the signal-fire mountain, dead. Sam and Eric, the twins responsible for watching the fire at night, are asleep and do not see the parachutist land. When the twins wake up, they see the enormous silhouette of his parachute and hear the strange flapping noises it makes. Thinking the island beast is at hand, they rush back to the camp in terror and report that the beast has attacked them.
The boys organize a hunting expedition to search for the monster. Jack and Ralph, who are increasingly at odds, travel up the mountain. They see the silhouette of the parachute from a distance and think that it looks like a huge, deformed ape. The group holds a meeting at which Jack and Ralph tell the others of the sighting. Jack says that Ralph is a coward and that he should be removed from office, but the other boys refuse to vote Ralph out of power. Jack angrily runs away down the beach, calling all the hunters to join him. Ralph rallies the remaining boys to build a new signal fire, this time on the beach rather than on the mountain. They obey, but before they have finished the task, most of them have slipped away to join Jack.
Jack declares himself the leader of the new tribe of hunters and organizes a hunt and a violent, ritual slaughter of a sow to solemnize the occasion. The hunters then decapitate the sow and place its head on a sharpened stake in the jungle as an offering to the beast. Later, encountering the bloody, fly-covered head, Simon has a terrible vision, during which it seems to him that the head is speaking. The voice, which he imagines as belonging to the Lord of the Flies, says that Simon will never escape him, for he exists within all men. Simon faints. When he wakes up, he goes to the mountain, where he sees the dead parachutist. Understanding then that the beast does not exist externally but rather within each individual boy, Simon travels to the beach to tell the others what he has seen. But the others are in the midst of a chaotic revelry—even Ralph and Piggy have joined Jack’s feast—and when they see Simon’s shadowy figure emerge from the jungle, they fall upon him and kill him with their bare hands and teeth.
The following morning, Ralph and Piggy discuss what they have done. Jack’s hunters attack them and their few followers and steal Piggy’s glasses in the process. Ralph’s group travels to Jack’s stronghold in an attempt to make Jack see reason, but Jack orders Sam and Eric tied up and fights with Ralph. In the ensuing battle, one boy, Roger, rolls a boulder down the mountain, killing Piggy and shattering the conch shell. Ralph barely manages to escape a torrent of spears.
Ralph hides for the rest of the night and the following day, while the others hunt him like an animal. Jack has the other boys ignite the forest in order to smoke Ralph out of his hiding place. Ralph stays in the forest, where he discovers and destroys the sow’s head, but eventually, he is forced out onto the beach, where he knows the other boys will soon arrive to kill him. Ralph collapses in exhaustion, but when he looks up, he sees a British naval officer standing over him. The officer’s ship noticed the fire raging in the jungle. The other boys reach the beach and stop in their tracks at the sight of the officer. Amazed at the spectacle of this group of bloodthirsty, savage children, the officer asks Ralph to explain. Ralph is overwhelmed by the knowledge that he is safe but, thinking about what has happened on the island, he begins to weep. The other boys begin to sob as well. The officer turns his back so that the boys may regain their composure."
Nourished,"The full title of Swift's pamphlet is ""A Modest Proposal for Preventing the Children of Poor People from Being a Burthen to their Parents, or the Country, and for Making them Beneficial to the Publick."" The tract is an ironically conceived attempt to ""find out a fair, cheap, and easy Method"" for converting the starving children of Ireland into ""sound and useful members of the Commonwealth."" Across the country poor children, predominantly Catholics, are living in squalor because their families are too poor to keep them fed and clothed.
The author argues, by hard-edged economic reasoning as well as from a self-righteous moral stance, for a way to turn this problem into its own solution. His proposal, in effect, is to fatten up these undernourished children and feed them to Ireland's rich land-owners. Children of the poor could be sold into a meat market at the age of one, he argues, thus combating overpopulation and unemployment, sparing families the expense of child-bearing while providing them with a little extra income, improving the culinary experience of the wealthy, and contributing to the overall economic well-being of the nation.
The author offers statistical support for his assertions and gives specific data about the number of children to be sold, their weight and price, and the projected consumption patterns. He suggests some recipes for preparing this delicious new meat, and he feels sure that innovative cooks will be quick to generate more. He also anticipates that the practice of selling and eating children will have positive effects on family morality: husbands will treat their wives with more respect, and parents will value their children in ways hitherto unknown. His conclusion is that the implementation of this project will do more to solve Ireland's complex social, political, and economic problems than any other measure that has been proposed."
Inflations,"Child of the Dark, the diary of Carolina Maria de Jesus, covers the period between July 1955 and January 1, 1960, with a gap, due to editing, between 1955 and 1958. Carolina has three children: Vera (two), José Carlos (five), and João (eight). They live in a favela, or shantytown, where living spaces consist of crude huts built of cardboard and wood scraps. Her daily life consists of collecting paper and metal scraps for food money. While looking for scraps outside a football stadium, Carolina endures taunts from white patrons. Carolina often fares no better closer to home—meddlesome favela woman like Dona Rosa and Dona Silvia pick fights with Carolina’s children and try to provoke Carolina. Favelalife is full of hunger, disease, violence, and alcoholism. Carolina’s only consolation is writing and the occasional kindness of friends and strangers, such as when a man stops by the favela and gives Carolina’s daughter, Vera, one hundred cruzieros, the equivalent of what Carolina often earns in a day.
Carolina struggles to insulate her children from bad influences, but she receives several summons from the police station regarding her boys’ behavior. After a few visits there, and after a neighbor woman, Chica, levels an accusation of rape against João, Carolina briefly considers interning her children in a public shelter for their own safety and wellbeing. Carolina believes that João’s accuser is lying, but she worries that her children are in danger while the matter is being investigated. After two runaways from the shelter seek refuge in Carolina’s home, and she hears their stories of horrible abuse, she changes her mind about putting her children there, recognizing that the experience would likely turn them into criminals. The fact that the favelachanges everyone it touches is a reality that Carolina fully understands. As she observes a new resident become increasingly argumentative and desperate as they adapt to the “dog-eat-dog” mentality that rules the favela, Carolina recognizes that a person can resist being dragged down by it only for so long.
Carolina takes every opportunity she can get to participate in Brazil’s political system, but after going to Congress to observe her leaders, she feels nothing but disgust. In response to the ignorance she sees from those in power, Carolina levels many critiques against the political system that she believes contributes to the poverty and hunger of the favelados. To Carolina, Brazil’s President Juscelino is a bird in a cage, and the favela dwellers are hungry cats that may someday rise up against him if given the chance. On a more day-to-day level, Carolina senses that she lives in a system that conspires against the poor. Inflation is rampant, and prices for basic necessities, such as rice and flour, can be absurd. When Carolina watches a factory owner dump rotted food near the favela, she considers it an act of blatant cruelty. Carolina also endures racial and class discrimination every time she ventures out of the favelaand into the city of São Paulo. While taking a streetcar, Carolina discusses the politician Dr. Adhemar with other passengers, who blame him for the steep increases in the cost of transportation. Carolina thinks that Adehemar is angry and wants to punish the poor. In the often-brutal world she lives in, Carolina wonders how much worse conditions can get.
Carolina refuses to put her interest in marrying before her interest in her children, even when she is proposed to by a man named Manuel, who, compared to the other favelados, is fairly well off, a worker and abstainer from alcohol. Against her own better judgment, Carolina also becomes intertwined with a gypsy named Raimundo, who awakens in her a sense of romance and adventure. Ultimately, she decides that he is not the man she thought he was, but when he moves away, she is sick and broken-hearted. Through both entanglements, Carolina maintains that she is not the marrying type, her children come first, and she is unwilling to make the sacrifices that she sees other women making in order to get married.
The intervention of a journalist named Audalio Dantas helps Carolina to realize her dream of being published. When excerpts of her diary appear in a weekly magazine called O Cruziero,Carolina tells everyone she can about her new fame. Unfortunately, being published does not have the effect that she was hoping for. Not only do Carolina’s dire daily circumstances remain unchanged, but she quickly finds success to be a bitter pill when the favela fills with disparaging talk of her motives. Even after her publication, Carolina must deal with the same challenges and frustrations: the struggle to scrape together enough money for food, the lines at the water spigot, the fights, and the racism and sexism she faces on a daily basis. Despite these daily humiliations, Carolina holds fast to her dream of finding a home far from the favela for her family."
Scheme,"Each chapter of Chains opens with a date ranging from May 27, 1776, to January 19, 1777, and a quotation from a document of the time. Since the novel uses the voice of the protagonist, Isabel, it reads much like a diary. The story opens with the funeral of Mary Finch, slave owner of Isabel and her sister Ruth and former owner of their deceased mother. Mary’s nephew, Robert, sells Isabel and Ruth to a couple from New York City, the Locktons, devout Tories who scorn the American Revolution and the rebels fighting against the king. Throughout the novel, people loyal to Britain call those fighting for independence “rebels,” while the men and women fighting to be free from Britain’s rule call themselves “patriots.” 
Isabel and Ruth travel from Rhode Island to New York by boat. At the dock, Madam Lockton hits Isabel, the first of many blows. Ruth, age five, is simple-minded, so Madam keeps her near and dressed like a pretty toy, while she works Isabel hard. Isabel promised their Momma that she would always protect Ruth. Isabel meets and becomes friends with Curzon, slave to patriot Mr. Bellingham. Curzon proposes that Isabel work for the patriots by spying on the Locktons in exchange for her freedom since Isabel might overhear secret plans. Madam’s cruelty convinces Isabel to join the patriot cause.
Becky Berry, a white servant, and Lady Seymour, Mr. Lockton’s aunt, both show kindness toward Isabel and Ruth. Isabel learns that money hidden in the Locktons’ wooden crate will pay patriots to switch sides, information valuable to the patriot leaders. This scheme and the plot to assassinate George Washington lead to Lockton’s arrest, but Isabel’s role is not suspected. Each day, Isabel fetches water from the Tea Water Pump, a gathering place for slaves, and meets a kind Grandfather who gives her good advice. Grandfather often speaks of “crossing the River Jordan” as a metaphor symbolizing each slave’s path to personal freedom.
When Madam witnesses Ruth’s seizure, she immediately wants to sell her, and Isabel realizes that the list of conspirators in the library drawer could be their ticket to escape. Isabel goes straight to Colonel Regan in the patriot headquarters, who gives her the code for future visits. As the Tories’ plans are uncovered, Lockton flees the city, leaving his wife behind. Isabel and Ruth attend the public hanging of the man blamed for the assassination plot, and the British plant their navy in the harbor, preparing for war. The patriots officially declare their independence, and the city fills with soldiers.
Madam sells Ruth, or so she says, which so infuriates Isabel that she angrily confronts Madam, an act that incites injury and Isabel’s escape. Isabel runs to Colonel Regan, who cannot help her, and she is dragged to a dungeon. After three hellish days, a judge sentences Isabel to be branded with an “I” on her cheek for Insolence. The branding is so painful Isabel loses consciousness for days and wakes in Lady Seymour’s house, nursed back to health, fed, and cleaned, her cheek still burning. Isabel must return to Madam and spends the next weeks in deep sadness, ignoring Curzon and wishing ill on Colonel Regan.
Violent thunderstorms hit New York City. Curzon has joined the patriot soldiers, who lose the Battle of Brooklyn and retreat. When the British invade New York, Isabel decides to work for them instead, hoping she’ll earn her freedom this way. She reports the location of Washington’s headquarters to a British officer, hoping he will help her escape, but he cannot. Lockton returns, and the Tories celebrate victory. When the Locktons and Lady Seymour accept British and Hussein soldiers into their homes, Isabel goes to Lady Seymour’s to help her care for them.
When the Great Fire hits New York, Isabel helps Lady Seymour escape, but Lady Seymour suffers great injury and her home is destroyed, so she moves in with the Locktons, along with more British soldiers and their wives, who take over the household chores. The British capture Fort Washington and march the surviving rebels to the prison, including Curzon. As Madam holds a feast to celebrate, Isabel overhears more plans, including hopes that thousands of prisoners would starve or die of disease. As Isabel carries a bowl of food scraps to the yard, she devises a plan.
Isabel begins to visit the prison regularly, delivering food and checking on Curzon, who has been shot. She earns the trust of a guard and a patriot leader. She nurses Lady Seymour, who supports her helping the prisoners. A shop owner gives Isabel a copy of Common Sense. Isabel carries messages between the prison and patriot officers at a huge risk to herself.
On Christmas, Isabel takes a long walk near the waterfront. Madam discovers that she’s been visiting the prison and forbids her from continuing to do so, so Isabel decides she must act. That evening, Isabel bakes a bread pudding and gifts it to a family in the burned part of the city, keeping Christmas the way her Momma did. A few days later, when Captain Morse asks Isabel to deliver a message to the prisoners informing them that Washington defeated the British in Trenton, she hears the prisoners cheer with joy. Afraid for his safety, Lockton flees to England. Lady Seymour apologizes to Isabel for not protecting her more and buying her herself, but Isabel cannot forgive her. When the prison guard offers Isabel work cleaning out the cells, she wonders if it’s an opportunity to pay for her freedom.
The city plans a celebration of the queen’s birthday, including dancing, fireworks, and feasting. Lady Seymour has suffered a stroke, which has left her unable to move or speak. On the day of the ball, Captain Morse asks Isabel to deliver a coin to another officer. That officer gives Isabel a note for Captain Morse, which she puts in her pocket. At home, Madam is furious because someone told her that her slave, Isabel, is passing notes for the rebels. When Madam demands the note, Isabel tosses it into the fire, inciting Madam’s wrath. In her fury, Madam lets it slip that she still owns Ruth, who has been living in Charleston, and then she locks Isabel in the cellar. Soon, Isabel escapes, determined to find Ruth. She writes herself a pass in the library, naming herself Isabel Gardener. Lady Seymour lets her take coins to aid her flight and whispers, “Run!”
Isabel runs to the prison, claiming to be there to clean, and finds Curzon in very bad shape. She hides him in a wheelbarrow and wheels him outside. She practically carries him to the waterfront, where they must pass a group of British soldiers. As they do, fireworks from the queen’s ball light the sky and distract the soldiers. Isabel steals a boat and rows herself and Curzon to New Jersey with bleeding and frozen hands. She wakes on the other side, knowing that they are free."
Guardian,"Jack Worthing, the play’s protagonist, is a pillar of the community in Hertfordshire, where he is guardian to Cecily Cardew, the pretty, eighteen-year-old granddaughter of the late Thomas Cardew, who found and adopted Jack when he was a baby. In Hertfordshire, Jack has responsibilities: he is a major landowner and justice of the peace, with tenants, farmers, and a number of servants and other employees all dependent on him. For years, he has also pretended to have an irresponsible black-sheep brother named Ernest who leads a scandalous life in pursuit of pleasure and is always getting into trouble of a sort that requires Jack to rush grimly off to his assistance. In fact, Ernest is merely Jack’s alibi, a phantom that allows him to disappear for days at a time and do as he likes. No one but Jack knows that he himself is Ernest. Ernest is the name Jack goes by in London, which is where he really goes on these occasions—probably to pursue the very sort of behavior he pretends to disapprove of in his imaginary brother.
Jack is in love with Gwendolen Fairfax, the cousin of his best friend, Algernon Moncrieff. When the play opens, Algernon, who knows Jack as Ernest, has begun to suspect something, having found an inscription inside Jack’s cigarette case addressed to “Uncle Jack” from someone who refers to herself as “little Cecily.” Algernon suspects that Jack may be leading a double life, a practice he seems to regard as commonplace and indispensable to modern life. He calls a person who leads a double life a “Bunburyist,” after a nonexistent friend he pretends to have, a chronic invalid named Bunbury, to whose deathbed he is forever being summoned whenever he wants to get out of some tiresome social obligation.
At the beginning of Act 1, Jack drops in unexpectedly on Algernon and announces that he intends to propose to Gwendolen. Algernon confronts him with the cigarette case and forces him to come clean, demanding to know who “Jack” and “Cecily” are. Jack confesses that his name isn’t really Ernest and that Cecily is his ward, a responsibility imposed on him by his adoptive father’s will. Jack also tells Algernon about his fictional brother. Jack says he’s been thinking of killing off this fake brother, since Cecily has been showing too active an interest in him. Without meaning to, Jack describes Cecily in terms that catch Algernon’s attention and make him even more interested in her than he is already.
Gwendolen and her mother, Lady Bracknell, arrive, which gives Jack an opportunity to propose to Gwendolen. Jack is delighted to discover that Gwendolen returns his affections, but he is alarmed to learn that Gwendolen is fixated on the name Ernest, which she says “inspires absolute confidence.” Gwendolen makes clear that she would not consider marrying a man who was not named Ernest.
Lady Bracknell interviews Jack to determine his eligibility as a possible son-in-law, and during this interview she asks about his family background. When Jack explains that he has no idea who his parents were and that he was found, by the man who adopted him, in a handbag in the cloakroom at Victoria Station, Lady Bracknell is scandalized. She forbids the match between Jack and Gwendolen and sweeps out of the house.
In Act 2, Algernon shows up at Jack’s country estate posing as Jack’s brother Ernest. Meanwhile, Jack, having decided that Ernest has outlived his usefulness, arrives home in deep mourning, full of a story about Ernest having died suddenly in Paris. He is enraged to find Algernon there masquerading as Ernest but has to go along with the charade. If he doesn’t, his own lies and deceptions will be revealed.
While Jack changes out of his mourning clothes, Algernon, who has fallen hopelessly in love with Cecily, asks her to marry him. He is surprised to discover that Cecily already considers that they are engaged, and he is charmed when she reveals that her fascination with “Uncle Jack’s brother” led her to invent an elaborate romance between herself and him several months ago. Algernon is less enchanted to learn that part of Cecily’s interest in him derives from the name Ernest, which, unconsciously echoing Gwendolen, she says “inspires absolute confidence.”
Algernon goes off in search of Dr. Chasuble, the local rector, to see about getting himself christened Ernest. Meanwhile, Gwendolen arrives, having decided to pay Jack an unexpected visit. Gwendolen is shown into the garden, where Cecily orders tea and attempts to play hostess. Cecily has no idea how Gwendolen figures into Jack’s life, and Gwendolen, for her part, has no idea who Cecily is. Gwendolen initially thinks Cecily is a visitor to the Manor House and is disconcerted to learn that Cecily is “Mr. Worthing’s ward.” She notes that Ernest has never mentioned having a ward, and Cecily explains that it is not Ernest Worthing who is her guardian but his brother Jack and, in fact, that she is engaged to be married to Ernest Worthing. Gwendolen points out that this is impossible as she herself is engaged to Ernest Worthing. The tea party degenerates into a war of manners.
Jack and Algernon arrive toward the climax of this confrontation, each having separately made arrangements with Dr. Chasuble to be christened Ernest later that day. Each of the young ladies points out that the other has been deceived: Cecily informs Gwendolen that her fiancé is really named Jack and Gwendolen informs Cecily that hers is really called Algernon. The two women demand to know where Jack’s brother Ernest is, since both of them are engaged to be married to him. Jack is forced to admit that he has no brother and that Ernest is a complete fiction. Both women are shocked and furious, and they retire to the house arm in arm.
Act 3 takes place in the drawing room of the Manor House, where Cecily and Gwendolen have retired. When Jack and Algernon enter from the garden, the two women confront them. Cecily asks Algernon why he pretended to be her guardian’s brother. Algernon tells her he did it in order to meet her. Gwendolen asks Jack whether he pretended to have a brother in order to come into London to see her as often as possible, and she interprets his evasive reply as an affirmation. The women are somewhat appeased but still concerned over the issue of the name. However, when Jack and Algernon tell Gwendolen and Cecily that they have both made arrangements to be christened Ernest that afternoon, all is forgiven and the two pairs of lovers embrace. At this moment, Lady Bracknell’s arrival is announced.
Lady Bracknell has followed Gwendolen from London, having bribed Gwendolen’s maid to reveal her destination. She demands to know what is going on. Gwendolen again informs Lady Bracknell of her engagement to Jack, and Lady Bracknell reiterates that a union between them is out of the question. Algernon tells Lady Bracknell of his engagement to Cecily, prompting her to inspect Cecily and inquire into her social connections, which she does in a routine and patronizing manner that infuriates Jack. He replies to all her questions with a mixture of civility and sarcasm, withholding until the last possible moment the information that Cecily is actually worth a great deal of money and stands to inherit still more when she comes of age. At this, Lady Bracknell becomes genuinely interested.
Jack informs Lady Bracknell that, as Cecily’s legal guardian, he refuses to give his consent to her union with Algernon. Lady Bracknell suggests that the two young people simply wait until Cecily comes of age, and Jack points out that under the terms of her grandfather’s will, Cecily does not legally come of age until she is thirty-five. Lady Bracknell asks Jack to reconsider, and he points out that the matter is entirely in her own hands. As soon as she consents to his marriage to Gwendolen, Cecily can have his consent to marry Algernon. However, Lady Bracknell refuses to entertain the notion. She and Gwendolen are on the point of leaving when Dr. Chasuble arrives and happens to mention Cecily’s governess, Miss Prism. At this, Lady Bracknell starts and asks that Miss Prism be sent for.
When the governess arrives and catches sight of Lady Bracknell, she begins to look guilty and furtive. Lady Bracknell accuses her of having left her sister’s house twenty-eight years before with a baby and never returned. She demands to know where the baby is. Miss Prism confesses she doesn’t know, explaining that she lost the baby, having absentmindedly placed it in a handbag in which she had meant to place the manuscript for a novel she had written. Jack asks what happened to the bag, and Miss Prism says she left it in the cloakroom of a railway station. Jack presses her for further details and goes racing offstage, returning a few moments later with a large handbag. When Miss Prism confirms that the bag is hers, Jack throws himself on her with a cry of “Mother!” It takes a while before the situation is sorted out, but before too long we understand that Jack is not the illegitimate child of Miss Prism but the legitimate child of Lady Bracknell’s sister and, therefore, Algernon’s older brother. Furthermore, Jack had been originally christened “Ernest John.” All these years Jack has unwittingly been telling the truth: Ernest is his name, as is Jack, and he does have an unprincipled younger brother—Algernon. Again the couples embrace, Miss Prism and Dr. Chasuble follow suit, and Jack acknowledges that he now understands “the vital Importance of Being Earnest.”"
Varying,"Refugee follows the stories of three different children and their families, each attempting to flee their violent homelands, in different regions of the world and during different decades. Josef and his family flee Nazi Germany in 1938; Isabel and her family flee Cuba in 1994; and Mahmoud and his family flee Syria in 2015.
Josef Landau is a twelve-year-old boy living in Berlin. In 1938, his home is raided by Nazi storm troopers, and his father is taken to the Dachau concentration camp. Six months later, his mother receives a telegram that her husband has been released, but the family must leave Germany immediately. Josef, his sister Ruth, and his mother all travel to Hamburg to board a ship that will take them to Cuba. When Josef’s father is reunited with his family, they notice that Dachau has changed him: he is paranoid and very thin. They board the St. Louis, a large German ship, and set out.
Aboard the St. Louis, Josef’s family and the other passengers, all Jewish refugees, are treated well by Captain Schroeder and most of the ship’s crew. A few of the crew, however, openly dislike the Jewish passengers, especially Otto Schiendick, who proudly states his Nazi allegiance. When the St. Louis reaches Havana Harbor in Cuba, the ship is not allowed to dock. Josef’s father’s mental state deteriorates further, and he eventually jumps from the ship, trying to kill himself. Officer Padron, a Cuban policeman assigned to the St. Louis, saves Josef’s father. Josef’s father is taken to Havana to recover. When Officer Padron returns to the St. Louis, he is treated like a hero by the Jewish passengers. 
Eventually, the captain announces that they are not going to be allowed to dock in Havana and that the boat will be leaving. He promises the passengers that he will try to deliver them to a country other than Germany. The refugees aboard the St. Louis are delivered to England, Belgium, the Netherlands, and France. The Nazis invade France just a few months after Josef’s family arrives there. When the family is eventually caught, Josef’s mother is forced to choose which of her children will be freed and which will be sent to a concentration camp.
Isabel Fernandez is an eleven-year-old girl who lives just outside Havana in 1994. After the fall of the Soviet Union, Cuba has become inhospitable for most of its citizens under the regime of Fidel Castro. Isabel’s best friend and neighbor, Iván, is building a small boat with his father so that his family can flee to America. After a riot in Havana, Isabel’s family decides that they should also leave Cuba immediately. Isabel trades her trumpet to a fisherman for gasoline, paying her family’s way onto Iván’s family’s boat. Lito, Isabel’s grandfather, also joins them. 
The two families face many challenges as they try to cross the Caribbean Sea to Florida. A storm sweeps them to the Bahamas, where they are not allowed to disembark; Iván is attacked by sharks and eventually bleeds to death in the boat; and toward the end of the journey, Isabel’s pregnant mother goes into labor. Lito tells the story of the St. Louis and how he had to turn away so many refugees when he was a young policeman. (He is Officer Padron from Josef’s story.) Just when Miami becomes visible on the horizon, a U.S. Coast Guard boat tries to intercept the two families. Lito jumps in the water to distract the Coast Guard, and Isabel’s mother gives birth to a boy, just as they reach the shore. When Isabel is asked to play a song at her new school in America, she plays a Cuban salsa version of “The Star-Spangled Banner.”
Mahmoud Bishara is a twelve-year-old boy who lives in Aleppo, Syria in 2015. For the last few years, there has been a war in his country between the Syrian government, rebels, the Soviets, the United States and several other factions. After Mahmoud’s home is destroyed, his brother Waleed, sister Hana, and his parents drive to the border of Turkey, hoping to escape. Mahmoud’s father tells them that Germany is accepting Syrian refugees and if they can get to Greece, they will be able to travel within the European Union to reach Germany. After a violent conflict between the rebels and the Syrian government, Mahmoud and his family walk to the Turkish border. Mahmoud’s father arranges for a smuggler to take them to the island of Lesbos, in Greece. The smuggler’s raft is destroyed by rocks as they cross the Mediterranean. Mahmoud hands his sister, Hana, to another passing raft of refugees, knowing that his mother cannot hold her and swim. The family is eventually pulled from the water by the Greek Coast Guard. 
Mahmoud and his family travel through Serbia and into Hungary, where they are detained at a refugee camp that is built like a prison. Mahmoud decides that he no longer wants to be ignored and leads the refugees out of the prison, walking twelve hours to Austria. The refugees are welcomed in Austria, and Mahmoud’s family takes a train to Germany. While they travel, they ask if anyone has seen Hana. After a few weeks in Munich, Mahmoud’s family is transferred to a host family in Berlin. An elderly couple, Herr and Frau Rosenberg, welcome them into their home. Frau Rosenberg takes Mahmoud aside and tells him the story of her childhood: she is Ruth, Josef’s sister. The night that they were captured in France, Josef volunteered to be taken by the Nazis; both Josef and their mother were killed in concentration camps. Ruth promises to help Mahmoud find Hana."
Perpetual,"The Unbearable Lightness of Being opens with a philosophical discussion of lightness versus heaviness. Kundera contrasts Nietzsche's philosophy of eternal return, or of heaviness, with Parmenides's understanding of life as light. Kundera wonders if any meaning or weight can be attributed to life, since there is no eternal return: if man only has the opportunity to try one path, to make one decision, he cannot return to take a different path, and then compare the two lives. Without the ability to co mpare lives, Kundera argues, we cannot find meaning; where meaning should exist we find only an unbearable weightlessness. The uncertain existence of meaning, and the opposition of lightness and heaviness, the key dichotomy of The Unbearable Lightness of Being, sets the stage for the entire novel.
The year is 1968. The protagonist, Tomas, a brilliant Prague surgeon, pursues a philosophy of lightness in his erotic adventures and exploits. Briefly married in the past, he neither sees nor wishes to see his ex-wife or young son and is comfortably established as a perpetual bachelor. He meets Tereza, a café waitress in a town he visits, and realizes when she follows him to Prague that she intends to ""offer him up her life."" A determined libertine, he momentarily resists his budding roma ntic feelings for her, then gives in to his love.
Tereza had been living a frustrated life as a waitress in a small town, and dreamed of escaping, especially from her vulgar mother. She recognizes in Tomas an intellectual and dreamer, and falls in love with him instantly. The two live together, but Tomas is unable to give up his mistresses. For a while he hides his infidelity from Teresa. Eventually he admits to it, but claims that his sexuality is entirely separate from his love for her. Tereza, unable to accept his behavior or adopt a light attitud e towards sex, suffers increasingly from nightmares, and contemplates suicide.
To keep Tereza happy, Tomas marries her. He keeps his mistresses, however, including his closest friend and long-term lover Sabina, a beautiful, reckless, and talented painter. In spite of herself, Tereza is charmed by Sabina's openness and light-heartedness, and the two women grow friendly. Sabina finds Tereza a job in Prague as a photographer. Despite her friendship with Sabina, however, Tereza's jealousy of Tomas does not slacken.
The events of the Prague Spring result in the Soviet military occupation of the city. Tomas, who in the past wrote an article condemning the Czech Communists, is warned to leave. Sabina flees first, and later Tomas and Tereza join her in Switzerland. Tereza, who found some fulfillment in her job as photographer in Prague, realizes that in Zurich she is jobless and must sit at home while Tomas continues having affairs. She decides that ""when the strong were too weak to hurt the weak, the weak had to be strong enough to leave,"" and returns to Prague. Tomas attempts to enjoy his newly recovered freedom for a few days, then gives up and returns to Prague and Tereza. The return truly means giving up freedom—there is no chance that the couple will be allo wed to leave again. In Prague, Tomas's political troubles escalate. He loses his position as surgeon for refusing to sign a denunciation of his anti-Communist article. Both the Communist regime and underground dissidents attempt to seduce him to their side. His own son reappears as a young dissident and preaches to Tomas with no success, for Tomas hates the idea of being used politically in the same way Sabina hates artistic kitsch. In the end, Tomas seeks obscurity in a job washing windows. His fame persists, however, and he continues seducing the women he works for.
Tereza, now a bartender, in a moment of desperation has an affair with a tall engineer who comes to her bar. She does so in hopes of coming closer to Tomas's way of life; instead she grows more miserable and becomes convinced the man was a police agent hired to gather potential blackmailing material. After many scenes and nightmares, she convinces Tomas to move with her to the country. This means giving up their way of life entirely, and an end to Tomas's erotic adventures.
After living peacefully in the country for some time, Tomas and Tereza are killed one night in a driving accident; they die instantly and together.
In Geneva, Sabina has a love affair with Franz, a university professor and idealistic intellectual who has more in common emotionally with Tereza than Sabina—he imbues his life with heavy meaning. He views Sabina as a romantic and courageous Czech dissident, and is tortured that he must betray his wife Marie-Claude in order to see her. Sabina loves Franz but their views on betrayal differ dramatically; whereas he hates the idea of betrayal, she views betrayal as the first step towards ""going off into the unknown,"" the most glorious thing she can think of.
When Franz leaves his wife and expects to move in with her, Sabina abruptly leaves Switzerland. Sabina leaves Geneva for Paris and then Paris for America; she learns of Tomas and Tereza's deaths from a letter and understands her last link to the past has been broken. She ends up living with an elderly American couple and wondering if she has reached the end of her perpetual flight.
Franz remains separated from his wife. After Sabina's betrayal, he finds consolation with a young student, a girl in over-sized glasses who loves him simply. Franz never accepts that he clearly misunderstood Sabina, but continues to hold her image as in ideal in his head, (wrongly) thinking his decisions in life would have made her proud. At his death, his wife reclaims Franz's body and orders the words ""A return after long wanderings"" written on his tombstone."
Look,"Looking for Alaska tells the story of Miles “Pudge” Halter, a high school junior who divides his life into time before and time after a life-changing event that the reader will not discover until later in the novel. 
Miles plans to attend the Culver Creek boarding school for his junior year of high school. Although his parents worry that Miles wants to attend the school because he does not have friends at his current school, Miles reveals that he is actually influenced by the last words of the poet François Rabelais about “seeking the Great Perhaps.” He moves to Birmingham, Alabama to attend Culver Creek and becomes friends with his roommate, Chip “The Colonel” Martin. Chip teaches Miles about the social structure of the school. He explains that the wealthy students that go home to their parents’ mansions every weekend (the “Weekday Warriors”) do not get along with his friend group. 
Chip introduces Miles to his friend Alaska, and Miles is quickly enamored by her. While Miles is obsessed with people’s final words and wants to seek François Rabelais’s “Great Perhaps,” Alaska enjoys books and wants to know the nature of “the labyrinth of suffering” that Simón Bolívar evoked in his final words.
The Weekday Warriors sneak into Chip and Miles’s dorm on Miles’s first night and throw Miles into the lake with his limbs bound by tape. Chip and Miles discover that this action was taken in retaliation for Chip supposedly ratting out their friends—a couple named Marya and Paul—and getting them expelled the previous year. Miles, Chip, Alaska, and another friend, Takumi, begin planning a revenge prank. Miles becomes part of their friend group and starts smoking cigarettes. The four of them get caught smoking and Alaska and Chip cover for Miles and Takumi, demonstrating to Miles that you cover for your friends instead of ratting them out. 
Miles settles into his new school and does well in his classes because he spends so much time studying. Alaska decides she will find Miles a girlfriend, and eventually introduces him to a Romanian student named Lara. Miles embarrasses himself on the first group date at a basketball game with Alaska, Alaska’s boyfriend Jake, Chip, Chip’s girlfriend Sara, Takumi, and Lara. Miles is hit by a basketball, gets concussed, and then vomits on Lara. Afterward, Miles tries to talk to Alaska, but is confused when Alaska becomes moody and short with him for no apparent reason.
The Weekday Warriors target Alaska with a prank, reminding Chip and Alaska they need to work on their own revenge prank. Takumi reveals to Miles that it was actually Alaska who ratted out the couple who were expelled the previous year. Takumi warns Miles that he cannot rat anyone else out if he gets caught carrying out the revenge prank. Miles is still infatuated with Alaska and asks his parents to let him stay at school over Thanksgiving break so he can be with her. Although he knows she has a boyfriend, Miles wants to be with Alaska. They ultimately spend Thanksgiving Day with Chip and his mom.
Lara joins Alaska, Chip, Takumi, and Miles as they execute their revenge prank on the Weekday Warriors. They set off fireworks and put dye in the Weekday Warriors’ hair products. They also get on the computer of the Dean (whom they call “the Eagle”) to send bad grade reports to the parents of the Weekday Warriors. The five of them spend the remainder of the night and weekend camping and hiding in a barn on campus as their alibi is that they were all off campus. They play a drinking game and Alaska reveals that, as a child, she saw her mom die of an aneurysm and did not call an ambulance because she thought her mom was just sleeping. When they quit playing the drinking game, Miles kisses Lara. He asks if she wants to be his girlfriend and she says yes. 
Miles spends time with Lara despite not having much to talk about, but they are physically intimate. He leaves Lara to spend time with Alaska and Chip in his room, watching them as they get drunk. Alaska dares Miles to make out with her. He does and she tells him it is to be continued in the future. They all go to sleep. Chip and Miles are startled awake later by Alaska frantically telling them she needs to leave because she had forgotten something. They provide a distraction for the Eagle so she can get in her car and drive away unnoticed.
The Eagle calls an assembly to announce to the student body that Alaska has died. Miles asks what happened and is informed that she drove straight into a police cruiser with its lights and sirens on, likely due to driving while intoxicated. Both Chip and Miles feel responsible for her death because they helped her drive away when they knew she was drunk. They mourn in different ways and attend Alaska’s funeral.
Miles and Chip go through Alaska’s room to see if there is anything they want to keep. They find a note she wrote in one of her books that said “straight and fast” was the way out of the labyrinth of suffering. This revelation makes Chip and Miles think she may have killed herself. Chip is eager to investigate her death and Miles reluctantly agrees to help. 
Religion class becomes more important to Miles after Alaska’s death because its subject matter becomes more real. Chip and Miles vent their anger to each other that so many people who did not know Alaska like they did are mourning her death. Chip leads their investigation into Alaska’s death. 
Chip and Miles interview the police officer who saw Alaska crash. Their interview supports their belief that she killed herself, so they research suicide warning signs. They do not remember Alaska exhibiting many of the warning signs and continue their investigation. Meanwhile, Miles avoids Lara. Takumi questions Miles about whether he is still dating Lara, and Takumi demands that Chip and Miles tell him about what they have been doing. They agree to tell him about their investigation in the future. 
Chip plans to see if Alaska might have been unable to swerve because of how drunk she was. He and Miles steal a breathalyzer from the Eagle and Chip drinks enough alcohol to match Alaska’s blood alcohol level at her time of death. He believes she would have been able to swerve, so he plans to call Jake, Alaska’s boyfriend, as a final effort. Miles is against calling Jake, but Chip does it anyway. They learn that Alaska told Jake that she would call him later, which further confuses the question of whether she killed herself or not.
Chip and Miles do not know what to investigate next, so they turn their attention to planning a prank in memory of Alaska. Chip pulls out plans Alaska had made for a prank, and Chip and Miles recruit other juniors at the school to execute it. They hire a male stripper, posing as a psychologist, to give a presentation at a Speaker’s Day event at their school. He delivers a speech about subverting the patriarchal paradigm and performs in front of the whole student body. 
Later in the year, Takumi points out to Chip and Miles that the date of Alaska’s death coincides with the date of the story Alaska shared with them about her mother’s death when they played a drinking game in the barn. The boys realize she must have forgotten the anniversary of her mother’s death and was driving to her grave to deliver flowers. Although they still feel guilty for helping her drive away drunk, and they do not know for sure whether it was an accident or suicide, they feel like they now have the closure they needed. 
“Straight and fast” was Alaska’s way out of the labyrinth of suffering, but Miles decides to choose the labyrinth over an escape. Miles feels more confident about seeking the Great Perhaps, despite the grief he experienced by loving and losing Alaska."
Hazards,"Marjane “Marji” Satrapi is an intelligent, spirited, and very modern girl living with her parents in Iran’s capital of Tehran during the eventful period of Iranian history from the late 1970s into the early 1980s. In Persepolis: The Story of a Childhood, Marji’s remembers her life during those years, mostly from when she was about ten to age fourteen. This account includes how Marji and her family lived through and were affected by turbulent events that included the overthrow of the autocratic Shah of Iran by the Islamic revolution, the oppressive fundamentalist regime that replaced the Shah, and the devasting Iran-Iraq war.
The nation’s wealth has long made it a target of outside invaders, but Islamic revolution of 1979 has pushed out the Western-backed government of the Shah.  The revolution has ushered in a new Islamic regime that is bringing massive societal changes impacting how people are supposed to behave--including Marji and her family. Marji struggles to adjust to the changes at her liberal French bilingual school, which has become increasingly stricter. Girls are required to wear veils and female and male students are now separated. Marji’s wealthy and modern parents—her father, Ebi, and her mother, Taji—take part in the massive protests against the new regime’s strict rules on behavior (just as they had previously protested against the Shah’s regime). Marji’s parents worry when a photo of Marji’s mother a protest appears in newspapers magazines. Later, after a demonstration they are at turns violent, the Satrapis decide that openly protesting is too dangerous to continue to do.
Marji feels conflict between her own deeply spiritual feelings and the stark modernism of her parents. She talks to God at night and has believed she will become a prophet one day since she was six years old, Marji. But the revolution leads to Marji setting aside these ambitions while she studies and imitates protestors and revolutionaries. She mimics protestors in the garden of her house and studies books about famous revolutionaries and philosophers given to her by her parents. She fantasizes about becoming a hero and wants her parents to become heroes too. Marji’s relationship with God becomes strained, as she finds that she and God have less to talk about—although God does still come by to see her from time to time.
Marji thrills when she learns that rebels fill her family history. She learns that her grandfather was a prince and later a communist whom the Shah removed from power and that her uncle Anoosh, also a communist, spent nine years in prison during the Shah’s regime. Marji spends a short time with Anoosh, learning about his life. After the Shah fell from power in 1979, Anoosh was released from prison, but when Islamic fundamentalists consolidate their grip on power, they hunt Anoosh down, imprison him, and later execute him. Her new idol killed, Marji feels crushed. She completely abandons her faith in God and increasingly questions the pro-regime propaganda she hears—especially at school.
Marji deeply loves and identifies with of her parents, even if she does sometimes feel that their actions and behavior (as wealthy and privileged individuals) do not always live up to their pro-democratic and liberal rhetoric. Marji also has a special connection with her grandmother, who remains stoic and inspiring to Marji in spite of the turmoil and numerous tragedies stemming from political actions that impact her and the family. Marji’s uncle Anoosh is not Marji’s only direct experience with the cruel consequences of the government’s actions. Throughout the book, death and devastation occurs among Marji’s extended family and friends as direct results of the brutality and fanaticism of the Iranian regimes and the war with Iraq.
People had rejoiced when the Shah was forced out, but as Islamic fundamentalists retain power, Marji and her family watch as their neighbors’ behavior shifts back and forth to coincide with the current political winds. The neighbors go from wearing short skirts and drinking alcohol to covering themselves and denouncing the use of alcohol. Marji’s parents ask her to tell everyone that she prays every day, a lie they hope will keep Marji safe, but acknowledge that the rules seem foolish. Marji grows more rebellious, as she increasingly views the rules at school and elsewhere as hypocritical and difficult to follow. Armed with more knowledge and personal experience, Marji begins to act out in ways that put her safety at risk. In fact, she even (accidentally) hits her principal during an argument, which results in her expulsion from school. Fearing her rebellious behavior will get her killed, Marji’s mother tries to reason with Marji by telling her that it is not her responsibility to serve justice and that the bad guys eventually pay for their sins in the end.
The war with Iraq had originally inspired Marji to vocal patriotism in protection her country against another invasion, but Marji begins to realize there are greater forces behind the war. She sees how the Islamic regime needs the war to continue survive and keep power. The war promotes a sense of nationalism and pride in the public, and those who die in the war are hailed as “martyrs.” Marji sees thousands of poor boys lured into war without proper training. She becomes increasingly uncomfortable and aware of class differences within society. Poor young boys are lured into the army with gold-painted keys to the “kingdom of heaven” to help them enter paradise after dying on the battlefield, while children in her wealthy neighborhood are left alone.
More and more people try to escape Iran as the borders tighten and Iraqi forces bomb Tehran and other Iranian cities. Realizing that Marji’s chances of escaping Iran are narrowing, her parents make the difficult decision to send her abroad alone to finish school in Vienna, explaining that only a good education will free her of Iran. Marji feels heartbroken. She spends one last night with her grandmother, who gives her warm advice and inspires her to be compassionate and understanding while in Vienna. Marji gives away all of her prized contraband to her friends, including a Kim Wilde poster. At the airport, as Marji turns to say goodbye to her parents one last time to see that her mother, devasted by her only child’s departure, has fainted."
Tragedy,"The Tragedy of Pudd'nhead Wilson juggles three plot lines, which all come together in a murder trial at the novel's end. Pudd'nhead Wilson is a Northerner who comes to the small Missouri town of Dawson's Landing to build a career as a lawyer. Immediately upon his arrival he alienates the townspeople, who don't understand his wit. They give him the nickname ""Pudd'nhead"" and refuse to give him their legal work. He scrapes by on odd work and spends most of his time dabbling in scientific hobbies, most notably, fingerprinting.
Roxana, or Roxy, is a beautiful slave who can pass for white, though she is one-sixteenth Black. To save her infant son from ever being sold away from her, she switches him with the child of her white master, who looks just like her son and was born on the same day. Her son Chambers, now called ""Tom,"" grows up as a white man and heir to an estate. Her master's child, Tom, now called ""Chambers"", grows up a slave. ""Tom"" grows into a cruel, cowardly man. His gambling debts lead him, under Roxy's guidance, to rob houses, sell the now-freed Roxy as a slave, and finally to murder his uncle, Judge Driscoll, in a botched robbery attempt.
Luigi and Angelo are former sideshow performers. Good-looking and charming, they claim to be Italian twins, heirs of a deposed nobleman. They arrive in Dawson's Landing to rent a room in Widow Cooper's house, claiming they are tired of the bustle of the world. Luigi confesses to Pudd'nhead Wilson, who has read his palm, that he once killed a man who tried to steal a fabulous Indian knife from the brothers. This knife is stolen by ""Tom"" and used to kill Judge Driscoll. Luigi gets into an argument with ""Tom,"" who has him arrested. The judge is mortified that ""Tom"" has compromised the family honor by doing that, and he instead challenges Luigi to a duel. No one is killed, but ""Tom,"" to save his own reputation, tells his uncle that Luigi is a confessed assassin and therefore not an honorable man to duel. The twins, initially popular in the town, lose their reputation through the judge's claims against them, and lose in an election for city offices in which Pudd'nhead Wilson is elected mayor. Shortly after the election, ""Tom,"" badly in debt and needing money to pay off the man to whom he has fraudulently sold Roxy, murders the judge with the twins' knife while he is robbing him.
""Tom"" escapes disguised as a woman after killing his uncle. The twins, out for a walk, hear the judge's cries and rush to help. They are found standing over the body and their bloody knife is on the floor. They are brought to trial for the murder. Pudd'nhead Wilson, who is their attorney, through his fingerprint collection and a few lucky accidents, discovers that ""Tom"" is the murderer and that he is not the real Tom but Chambers. The twins are redeemed and freed, but soon leave for Europe. ""Tom"" is thrown in jail and then, since it is now known he is a slave, sold ""down the river"" to pay debts from the estate of the real Tom's father. ""Chambers,"" revealed to be Tom, is given back his place as a white man and heir, but, raised as a Black man and marked by his Black speech patterns, he now fits into society nowhere. Pudd'nhead is mayor of Dawson's Landing and finally a success as a lawyer, but none of his old friends are around anymore to enjoy his success with him."
Deluge,"The epic’s prelude offers a general introduction to Gilgamesh, king of Uruk, who was two-thirds god and one-third man. He built magnificent ziggurats, or temple towers, surrounded his city with high walls, and laid out its orchards and fields. He was physically beautiful, immensely strong, and very wise. Although Gilgamesh was godlike in body and mind, he began his kingship as a cruel despot. He lorded over his subjects, raping any woman who struck his fancy, whether she was the wife of one of his warriors or the daughter of a nobleman. He accomplished his building projects with forced labor, and his exhausted subjects groaned under his oppression. The gods heard his subjects’ pleas and decided to keep Gilgamesh in check by creating a wild man named Enkidu, who was as magnificent as Gilgamesh. Enkidu became Gilgamesh’s great friend, and Gilgamesh’s heart was shattered when Enkidu died of an illness inflicted by the gods. Gilgamesh then traveled to the edge of the world and learned about the days before the deluge and other secrets of the gods, and he recorded them on stone tablets.
The epic begins with Enkidu. He lives with the animals, suckling at their breasts, grazing in the meadows, and drinking at their watering places. A hunter discovers him and sends a temple prostitute into the wilderness to tame him. In that time, people considered women and sex calming forces that could domesticate wild men like Enkidu and bring them into the civilized world. When Enkidu sleeps with the woman, the animals reject him since he is no longer one of them. Now, he is part of the human world. Then the harlot teaches him everything he needs to know to be a man. Enkidu is outraged by what he hears about Gilgamesh’s excesses, so he travels to Uruk to challenge him. When he arrives, Gilgamesh is about to force his way into a bride’s wedding chamber. Enkidu steps into the doorway and blocks his passage. The two men wrestle fiercely for a long time, and Gilgamesh finally prevails. After that, they become friends and set about looking for an adventure to share. 
Gilgamesh and Enkidu decide to steal trees from a distant cedar forest forbidden to mortals. A terrifying demon named Humbaba, the devoted servant of Enlil, the god of earth, wind, and air, guards it. The two heroes make the perilous journey to the forest, and, standing side by side, fight with the monster. With assistance from Shamash the sun god, they kill him. Then they cut down the forbidden trees, fashion the tallest into an enormous gate, make the rest into a raft, and float on it back to Uruk. Upon their return, Ishtar, the goddess of love, is overcome with lust for Gilgamesh. Gilgamesh spurns her. Enraged, the goddess asks her father, Anu, the god of the sky, to send the Bull of Heaven to punish him. The bull comes down from the sky, bringing with him seven years of famine. Gilgamesh and Enkidu wrestle with the bull and kill it. The gods meet in council and agree that one of the two friends must be punished for their transgression, and they decide Enkidu is going to die. He takes ill, suffers immensely, and shares his visions of the underworld with Gilgamesh. When he finally dies, Gilgamesh is heartbroken.
Gilgamesh can’t stop grieving for Enkidu, and he can’t stop brooding about the prospect of his own death. Exchanging his kingly garments for animal skins as a way of mourning Enkidu, he sets off into the wilderness, determined to find Utnapishtim, the Mesopotamian Noah. After the flood, the gods had granted Utnapishtim eternal life, and Gilgamesh hopes that Utnapishtim can tell him how he might avoid death too. Gilgamesh’s journey takes him to the twin-peaked mountain called Mashu, where the sun sets into one side of the mountain at night and rises out of the other side in the morning. Utnapishtim lives beyond the mountain, but the two scorpion monsters that guard its entrance refuse to allow Gilgamesh into the tunnel that passes through it. Gilgamesh pleads with them, and they relent. 
After a harrowing passage through total darkness, Gilgamesh emerges into a beautiful garden by the sea. There he meets Siduri, a veiled tavern keeper, and tells her about his quest. She warns him that seeking immortality is futile and that he should be satisfied with the pleasures of this world. However, when she can’t turn him away from his purpose, she directs him to Urshanabi, the ferryman. Urshanabi takes Gilgamesh on the boat journey across the sea and through the Waters of Death to Utnapishtim. Utnapishtim tells Gilgamesh the story of the flood—how the gods met in council and decided to destroy humankind. Ea, the god of wisdom, warned Utnapishtim about the gods’ plans and told him how to fashion a gigantic boat in which his family and the seed of every living creature might escape. When the waters finally receded, the gods regretted what they’d done and agreed that they would never try to destroy humankind again. Utnapishtim was rewarded with eternal life. Men would die, but humankind would continue. 
When Gilgamesh insists that he be allowed to live forever, Utnapishtim gives him a test. If you think you can stay alive for eternity, he says, surely you can stay awake for a week. Gilgamesh tries and immediately fails. So Utnapishtim orders him to clean himself up, put on his royal garments again, and return to Uruk where he belongs. Just as Gilgamesh is departing, however, Utnapishtim’s wife convinces him to tell Gilgamesh about a miraculous plant that restores youth. Gilgamesh finds the plant and takes it with him, planning to share it with the elders of Uruk. But a snake steals the plant one night while they are camping. As the serpent slithers away, it sheds its skin and becomes young again. 
When Gilgamesh returns to Uruk, he is empty-handed but reconciled at last to his mortality. He knows that he can’t live forever but that humankind will. Now he sees that the city he had repudiated in his grief and terror is a magnificent, enduring achievement—the closest thing to immortality to which a mortal can aspire."
Upon,"Bri Jackson, the narrator of the novel, is a 16-year-old girl from Garden Heights, a predominantly Black inner-city neighborhood. Bri has her sights set on rap stardom, hoping to follow in the footsteps of her late father, the underground rap star Lawless. As the novel opens, Bri is nervously awaiting the phone call that could be her big break: an invitation to perform in the Ring, a local club where up-and-coming rappers face off in “battles.” But first, she must endure her ACT prep class at Midtown School of the Arts so she can get her confiscated phone back from her teacher. Bri’s two best friends from Garden Heights, Sonny and Malik, are in the class with her. Like many of the other students of color at Midtown Academy, they are bused in from less affluent neighborhoods. 
By the time Bri finally gets the call to battle at the Ring, both her teacher and her mother, Jay, have reminded her that school, not rap, is the key to her future. But Bri remains fixated on rap stardom as the solution to her family’s financial problems, especially after she learns that Jay, a recovering drug addict, has lost her job. Bri’s Aunt Pooh, a gang member and a drug dealer, escorts Bri to the battle at the Ring, where she squares off with Milez, another teen rapper. In the first round of the battle, Milez raps about Lawless’s murder, shocking Bri and causing her to freeze up when it is her turn to rap. But she soon recovers and outperforms Milez in the next two rounds, winning the battle decisively. By the following morning, a video of the battle is on YouTube and all Bri’s classmates are praising her for her skills.  
Bri’s celebration is short-lived, however. Tate and Long, two school security guards who have a reputation for targeting Black and Latinx students, single Bri out to have her bag searched. When Bri objects, they violently throw her to the ground and cuff her. Bri is suspended for having candy—which her principal refers to as ""contraband—in her backpack. The security guards are suspended too, pending an investigation, but rumors circulate around the school that Bri is a drug dealer.   
Angry about the assault and people’s racist assumptions about her, Bri writes and records a defiant song called “On the Come Up.” In the song, Bri rails against racist police and other authority figures. She also boasts about having a gun and being ready to use it—because that’s what people expect anyway—even though she barely knows anything about guns. Bri shares the recording with Supreme, her father’s old manager, who promises to make her famous. Supreme releases “On the Come Up” online, where it gets picked up by a Black gossip blog and goes viral. Many of Bri’s friends love the song, but Aunt Pooh, Malik, and Trey all chastise Bri for misrepresenting herself and rapping about gang violence that she has never taken part in.  
Real violence breaks out when Tate and Long are reinstated as the school security guards. Students of color protest outside the school while chanting some of the violent lyrics from “On the Come Up.” When Tate and Long warn them to stop, some students attack the security guards, and a riot ensues. A local news station reports that Bri’s song incited the violence. Jay sees the newscast, learns about Bri’s song for the first time, and insists that Bri stop rapping, lay low, and focus on school. Instead, Bri takes to Instagram and is interviewed by a local radio show, defiantly claiming on both platforms that she won’t be silenced. During the radio interview, Bri has to be restrained after DJ Hype insults her with sexist taunts. Bri begins to feel as though she’s becoming the violent person that others assume she is.  
Meanwhile, Bri’s family continues to struggle, falling behind on bills and rent. The electric company shuts off the power and the landlord threatens eviction. Jay quits school, setting aside her dreams so she can become eligible for food stamps. To make matters worse, the Crowns, a rival gang, rob Bri and Malik at gunpoint, taking her father’s gold chain. Aunt Pooh vows to get revenge on the Crowns and disappears for ten days. When she returns, Aunt Pooh is arrested in a drug bust and taken to jail while Bri looks on.  
With her family’s struggles in mind, Bri goes to a recording studio again, this time with Supreme. Supreme encourages Bri to embrace the persona of a “hoodlum” in her music because that is what people expect of Black rappers. He has another rapper write a song for Bri to record. Even though Bri does not agree with the lyrics, she reluctantly agrees to record the song, hoping to impress a white record executive.  
Bri returns to the Ring once more, where she is supposed to perform the song she recorded. Instead, Bri freestyles her own lyrics about refusing to be what people think she should be. The record executive angrily walks out, but the crowd goes wild. Later, an unnamed celebrity retweets the video of Bri’s freestyle and calls her the future of hip-hop. Bri decides that she will pursue a rap career, but only if she can do it on her own terms."
Achievements,"In Outliers: The Story of Success, Malcolm Gladwell considers the circumstances that lead to success. The first half of the book looks closely at how opportunities matter more in the lives of successful people than hard work or raw talent. The second half of the book focuses on cultural legacies: behavioral tendencies rooted in their ancestral past.
Part One examines the role of opportunity in the lives of extremely successful people. Gladwell’s first example is the Canadian Hockey League, the world’s most competitive youth hockey league. Since the cutoff date for the Canadian leagues that serve the youngest players is January 1, those born in the first part of the calendar year are much larger and more coordinated than their peers. The larger and more coordinated kids are given more playing time and better coaching, and thus become better players by the time they reach the top league. An overwhelming majority of Canadian professional hockey players have birthdays in January, February or March.
Gladwell proposes that 10,000 hours of practice is needed to master a skill, even for prodigies like Mozart. Bill Joy, Bill Gates, and the Beatles all worked hard to achieve success but benefited from opportunities they did not create. Joy, one of the founders of Sun Microsystems, happened to attend one of the first colleges in the world with a time-sharing terminal. In graduate school, he had a terminal in his room, where he spent all of his free time programming. Gates happened to attend a private high school with a time-sharing terminal connected to a mainframe in Seattle. He also was able to spend all of his free time programming. Early on, the Beatles were hired to play long shows day after day in Hamburg, Germany. 
Birth year or era is another form of opportunity. Gates and Joy (as well as other early programmers) all reached the end of their teen years just as personal computers became available to the public. In another example, fourteen of the top seventy-five richest people in the history of the world happened to be alive at the same time, in the same country: the United States in the mid-1800s.
Opportunity matters more than an individual’s IQ. Using a study conducted by Lewis Terman, the creator of the Stanford-Binet IQ test, Gladwell shows that “practical intelligence” is as important as “analytical intelligence.” He also contrasts Chris Langan, one of the world’s smartest living people, with Robert Oppenheimer. While both had difficulties in college, only Oppenheimer had a successful life, due to his practical intelligence.
The last portion of Part One looks at Joe Flom, a successful lawyer from New York City. While he was born into a poor family to Jewish immigrants (in a time when Jewish immigrants were not treated well), many of the disadvantages in his life were actually benefits and directly contributed to his success.
Part Two investigates cultural legacies. Using flight recorder transcripts from several plane crashes from the last few decades, Gladwell shows that cultural expectations and habits can be a severe hindrance to pilots. Copilots from countries that have a high “Power Distance Index” (those that show the most deference to authority) will often avoid telling pilots that they are making mistakes, even when the mistakes are potentially fatal. After recognizing the dangers of such cultural expectations, commercial aviation has instituted programs to change the way flight crews talk with one another. 
Gladwell next analyzes the disparity in public school math test scores between Eastern and Western countries. He suggests that the cultures in which rice paddy farming is historically important have a stronger work ethic. Using various examples, Gladwell shows that hard work has a greater impact on success in learning mathematics than intelligence. 
The final example is an examination of the KIPP school in the South Bronx and the “achievement gap” between socioeconomic groups. American students from middle-class and affluent households retain more information over summer vacation and are more likely to make additional gains than students from low-income households. The KIPP school uses longer school days and summer programming to eliminate the achievement gap for low-income children. While the work schedule is very rigorous, the school’s students go on to great academic success.
Gladwell demonstrates that if more opportunities were available, there would be far more successful people and the world would be richer for it."
Supporters,"Eighty-year-old Lily reflects on her life starting from her early childhood. From the age of five, she longs for her mother’s love, believing that she is not worthy of it. At age six, the matchmaker Madame Wang claims Lily’s feet may be perfect after they are bound, and that with a laotong, or contracted female friendship, Lily may be eligible to marry into a family in the prosperous village of Tongkou. The next year, Lily begins her footbinding along with her cousin, Beautiful Moon, and younger sister. The process is extremely painful, and Lily’s sister, Third Sister, dies from an infection. Madame Wang visits again and says she has found a laotong match for Lily, a girl named Snow Flower from a noble family. Snow Flower writes a message to Lily on a fan in nu shu, the secret women’s language, inviting her to be her laotong. Lily replies to the message on the same fan, which they will use to write back and forth to each other for the rest of their friendship.
Lily and Snow Flower grow close over the years as they prepare for marriage, learn the domestic arts, and become adept in nu shu. One day, while sitting outside embroidering textiles for their future families, Beautiful Moon is stung by a bee and dies. Two years later, Lily marries into the affluent Lu family. After her wedding, she visits Snow Flower’s home for the first time to help Snow Flower prepare for her own marriage. However, Lily is shocked to find the home has fallen into disrepair, and that Snow Flower’s mother is dressed like a peasant. Snow Flower explains that her father had to sell their family’s land and possessions to pay for his sisters’ bride prices as he was the only son of his family. He then became addicted to opium, forcing the family into disgrace. Lily is further horrified to learn that Snow Flower will be marrying a butcher, which is seen as the dirtiest of professions. Lily insists that her feelings toward Snow Flower have not changed. However, she feels betrayed and takes her anger out on her mother for withholding the truth about Snow Flower’s family.
Over the next few years, Lily secures her place in her in-laws’ home by giving birth to two sons. Snow Flower has a son followed by two stillborn daughters, for whom she grieves. Lily and Snow Flower give birth to daughters around the same time and agree that they will be laotong. As typhoid strikes, Lily’s in-laws die, and she and her husband take on the roles of Master and Lady Lu. Once the illness subsides, Lily visits Snow Flower, though they are forced to escape to the mountains with Snow Flower’s family when a rebellion makes its way to the village. They remain in the freezing mountains for three months. After Snow Flower’s second son dies, her husband beats her until she miscarries. Depressed, Snow Flower confides in Lily how her husband mistreats her, though Lily advises Snow Flower to be obedient in order to avoid more abuse from her husband. When they are allowed to return home, Lily is thrilled to be reunited with her family. Snow Flower continues to write of her troubles, while Lily continues to implore Snow Flower to be obedient and give her husband another son.
One day, Lily receives a message from Snow Flower, saying a group of sworn sisters in her village has promised to love her, and that Lily will not have to listen to Snow Flower’s complaints anymore. Lily is furious, as she thinks this means Snow Flower has forsaken their laotong contract. She ignores other messages from Snow Flower, and rebuffs Madame Wang when she visits to begin the laotong relationship between Lily and Snow Flower’s daughters. Eventually, Lily and Snow Flower attend a Singing and Sitting Ceremony for a girl who is Lily’s neighbor and Snow Flower’s relative. Snow Flower delivers a Letter of Vituperation to Lily, explaining her sadness at Lily’s rejection of her. Lily delivers a Letter of Vituperation back, accusing Snow Flower of ending their relationship and revealing to the entire group all of Snow Flower’s secrets. Snow Flower leaves, and Lily’s Letter of Vituperation is spread throughout the county as a reminder of the importance of following cultural norms.
Eight years later, Lily has tried to forget Snow Flower. However, when Snow Flower’s daughter shows up at Lily’s house and tells Lily her mother is dying, Lily goes to her. The sworn sisters are with Snow Flower, though she mainly wants Lily’s company. Lily tries to find remedies for Snow Flower’s illness, though the sworn sisters tell her she is just making Snow Flower suffer more. Lily remains with Snow Flower until she dies. After Snow Flower is buried, Lily realizes she misread Snow Flower’s nu shu, as Snow Flower never officially became part of the sworn sisters and so did not violate their laotong relationship. Lily realizes how unfairly she treated Snow Flower, and spends the rest of her life trying to make it up to Snow Flower’s children as well as Snow Flower herself, by telling this story."
Supergovernment,"A Clockwork Orange takes place in a futuristic city governed by a repressive, totalitarian super-State. In this society, ordinary citizens have fallen into a passive stupor of complacency, blind to the insidious growth of a rampant, violent youth culture. The protagonist of the story is Alex, a fifteen-year-old boy who narrates in a teenage slang called nadsat, which incorporates elements of Russian and Cockney English. Alex leads a small gang of teenage criminals—Dim, Pete, and Georgie—through the streets, robbing and beating men and raping women. Alex and his friends spend the rest of their time at the Korova Milkbar, an establishment that serves milk laced with drugs, and a bar called the Duke of New York.
Alex begins his narrative from the Korova, where the boys sit around drinking. When Alex and his gang leave the bar, they go on a crime spree that involves mugging, robbery, a gang fight, auto theft, breaking and entering, and rape. The last of these crimes is particularly brutal. The boys travel to the countryside with their stolen car, break into a cottage and beat up the man inside before raping his wife while making him watch. They then head back to the Korova, where they fight with each other. Alex, who loves classical music, becomes angry at Dim when Dim mocks an opera that Alex likes. Alex punches Dim in the face, which prompts the others to turn against their arrogant leader. The next time they go out, they break into an old woman’s house. She calls the police, and before Alex can get away, Dim hits him in the eye with a chain and runs away with the others. The police apprehend Alex and take him to the station, where he later learns that the woman he beat and raped during the earlier robbery has died. 
Alex is sentenced to fourteen years in prison. At first, prison is difficult for him. The guards are merciless and oppressive, and several of the other prisoners want to rape him. After a few years, though, prison life becomes easier. He befriends the prison chaplain, who notices Alex’s interest in the Bible. The chaplain lets Alex read in the chapel while listening to classical music, and Alex pores over the Old Testament, delighting in the sex, drinking, and fighting he finds in its pages. 
One day, after fighting with and killing a cellmate, Alex is selected as the first candidate for an experimental treatment called Ludovico’s Technique, a form of brainwashing that incorporates associative learning. After being injected with a substance that makes him dreadfully sick, the doctors force Alex to watch exceedingly violent movies. In this way, Alex comes to associate violence with the nausea and headaches he experiences from the shot. The process takes two weeks to complete, after which the mere thought of violence has the power to make Alex ill. As an unintended consequence of the treatment, Alex can no longer enjoy classical music, which he has always associated with violence. This side effect doesn’t bother the State, which considers Alex’s successful treatment a victory for law and order and plans to implement it on a large scale.
After two years in prison, Alex is released, a harmless human being incapable of vicious acts. Soon, however, Alex finds he’s not only harmless but also defenseless, as his earlier victims begin to take revenge on him. His old friend Dim and an old enemy named Billyboy are both police officers now, and they take the opportunity to settle old scores. They drive him to a field in the country, beat him, and leave him in the rain. Looking for charity, Alex wanders to a nearby cottage and knocks on the door, begging for help. The man living there lets him in and gives him food and a room for the night. Alex recognizes him from two years ago as the man whose wife he raped, but the man does not recognize Alex, who wore a mask that night. Alex learns later in the night that the man’s wife died of shock shortly after being raped. 
This man, F. Alexander, is a political dissident. When he hears Alex’s story, he thinks he can use Alex to incite public outrage against the State. He and three of his colleagues develop a plan for Alex to make several public appearances. Alex, however, is tired of being exploited for other people’s schemes. He berates the men in nadsat, which arouses the suspicion of F. Alexander, who still remembers the strange language spoken by the teenagers who raped his wife. Based on F. Alexander’s suspicion, the men change their plans. They lock Alex in an apartment and blast classical music through the wall, hoping to drive Alex to suicide so they can blame the government. 
Alex does, in fact, hurl himself out of an attic window, but the fall doesn’t kill him. While he lies in the hospital, unconscious, a political struggle ensues, but the current administration survives. State doctors undo Ludovico’s Technique and restore Alex’s old vicious self in exchange for Alex’s endorsement. Back to normal, Alex assembles a new gang and engages in the same behavior as he did before prison, but he soon begins to tire of a life of violence. After running into his old friend Pete, who is now married and living a normal life, Alex decides that such a life is what he wants for himself. His final thoughts are of his future son."

Hazard,"Rashad and Quinn are both students at Springfield Central High School. They have some friends in common but have never interacted with each other. Rashad is Black, and his father has told him throughout his life about the importance of discipline for young Black men. Rashad’s father joined the army and then the police force before retiring and often tells Rashad that the army is the best opportunity for a Black man to succeed in the United States. Because of this, Rashad is part of the Reserve Officer Training Corps, or ROTC. However, Rashad would rather spend his time drawing and hanging out with his friends English, Shannon, and Carlos. 
Quinn is white, and his father died in Afghanistan. Quinn lives with his mother and his younger brother, Willy, and resents that people expect him to live up to the memory of his father. Quinn’s best friends are Dwyer and Guzzo, who lives across the street. Guzzo’s brother, Paul Galluzzo, is a police officer and has acted as a father figure to Quinn ever since Quinn’s father died. Quinn, Dwyer, and Guzzo are on the basketball team together, along with English.
One Friday, Rashad and Quinn are each planning on going to a party with their friends at Guzzo and Paul’s cousin Jill’s house. Quinn has a crush on Jill. On the way to the party, Rashad stops at Jerry’s Corner Mart to pick up some chips and gum. Jerry’s is always monitored by a police officer as a response to shoplifting incidents at the store. While Rashad is picking out chips, he goes to text his brother, Spoony. His phone is in his bag, so he puts it on the floor and kneels down to take the phone out. While he is kneeling, a woman who was standing behind him backs up and trips over him, causing them both to fall over and Rashad’s chips to slide up the aisle. 
The police officer on duty comes over and asks what happened but assumes Rashad was trying to steal before Rashad or the woman can explain. The police officer drags Rashad outside, handcuffs him, throws him to the ground, and begins beating him. Meanwhile, Quinn and his friends have been waiting in the alley next to Jerry’s to ask an adult to buy them beer that they can take to the party. When Quinn goes around to the front of Jerry’s, he sees what the police officer is doing to Rashad. He recognizes the police officer as Paul Galluzzo. He tells his friends to run and, when they are far enough away, explains what happened and tells Guzzo that he saw his brother. The three decide to go to the party and try to forget about it.
Over the weekend, Rashad wakes up in the hospital with a broken nose and ribs and is told he needs to stay there so the doctors can monitor his internal bleeding. Rashad’s father questions whether Rashad was presenting himself in a way that made him seem dangerous, while Spoony is outraged at the situation. The local news obtains footage of Paul beating Rashad and begins covering the story. The Galluzzo family decides to have a cookout on Sunday, which Quinn and Jill both find strange. Quinn and Jill talk at the cookout about what Paul did to Rashad, while Paul and Guzzo try to intimidate Quinn into not saying anything about what he saw.
At school that week, everyone is talking about what happened to Rashad. Quinn feels conflicted as he has only ever seen the good side of Paul and doesn’t know Rashad. On Tuesday, someone has painted graffiti on the sidewalk in front of the school that says, “Rashad is absent again today.” This message creates a division in the school between those who believe Rashad was innocent and those who believe Paul was just doing his job. When Rashad sees a picture of the graffiti, he knows it is Carlos’s work. 
Spoony and his girlfriend, Berry, plan a protest that coming Friday against the police department. Guzzo continues to question Quinn’s loyalty. At first, Quinn wants to believe that Paul was just trying to do his job, but he just can’t forget what he saw outside Jerry’s. On Thursday, Quinn wears a shirt to school that says, “I’m marching. Are you?” The coach of the basketball team tells the players not to go to the protest and tells Quinn he will call his mother to tell her about his shirt. Quinn’s mother confronts him about the protest, and Quinn says he is standing up for what he believes in, just as his father would have done.
The doctor releases Rashad from the hospital on Thursday, and Rashad plans on joining the protest the following day. On Friday morning, Rashad and Quinn both feel nervous about the protest. Quinn sees a tank-like police vehicle headed toward the school and worries about the protesters’ safety. However, after talking with Jill, he understands that Black people live in fear of police violence every day and that they should put themselves at risk for one day to speak out against this reality. Rashad and Quinn, along with an enormous crowd, march from Jerry’s Corner Mart to the police department, where they stage a die-in as Berry reads aloud the names of unarmed Black people killed by police officers. Rashad and Quinn notice each other during the die-in and feel a connection as they both think of the people on the list and how they will keep fighting for them."
Gallantry,"Three adventurous friends—Vandyck Jennings (the narrator, also called Van), Terry Nicholson, and Jeff Margrave—join a scientific expedition to one of the few remaining uncharted areas of the world, although Van leaves the exact region ambiguous as he tells the story. As they travel, the friends hear persistent rumors of a strange land, hidden high in the mountains, that is populated only by women. Intrigued, the men investigate the rumors and do, in fact, find evidence of an advanced, isolated culture in the mountains, cut off from the rest of the world. Doubtful about the existence of an all-female country, the men are nevertheless excited by the chance to explore an unknown land, and they resolve to return on their own to find it. The three are driven by a genuine desire for knowledge, a love of adventure, and, although Van is ashamed to admit it, by fantasies stoked by the tales they have heard of a land full of women without men.
The friends equip an expedition back to the hidden plateau and begin to survey the area using Terry’s airplane. From the air, they see signs of an advanced civilization and decide to land. As they explore the hidden country, the men notice the obvious cultivation of the forests and the great skill with which the roads have been laid. Terry takes these signs of agricultural and technological skill as evidence that there must be men around after all.
At first, the men are unable to discover any of the inhabitants, but soon they notice three young women watching them from the trees. The men make several attempts to entice them to come closer but have little luck, although the women obviously find the men interesting. Terry uses a necklace to draw one of the women closer, then makes a grab for her. The women flee, showing amazing athleticism. The men give chase but are soon left behind. The men follow them into the nearest settlement, where they are greeted by a large gathering of women. The women are unlike any the men have ever encountered: strong, self-confident, clearly intelligent, and obviously unafraid of men. The women indicate that they want the men to follow them, but the three friends are unwilling to be taken into custody. The men decide to make a break for it, but they are soon overcome by the women, who drug them into unconsciousness.
The men awake to find themselves unharmed but captive. The women treat the men well and begin to teach them their language, although the men are still not allowed to roam freely. After a while, the men, especially Terry, become impatient and decide to attempt an escape. They fashion a crude rope and lower themselves to the ground outside their window. From there, the men sneak back toward their airplane, hiding themselves carefully during the day. When they find the airplane, the men also encounter the three young women they met upon their arrival: Celis, Alima, and Ellador. The men begin talking to the women and become so distracted that they are soon recaptured. Back in custody, the men learn that their escape attempt had been anticipated and that they had, in fact, been observed the whole time.
Now resigned to their gentle captivity, the men begin to question their tutors about the history and organization of what they have come to call “Herland.” They are told that Herland has been without men for 2,000 years, ever since a sequence of wars, natural disasters, and internal strife combined to leave a small population of women alone atop their hidden plateau. Forced to fend for themselves under extreme circumstances, the women organized their society along the most rational lines possible, realizing that they would never survive without cooperation. After a time, a young girl miraculously became pregnant, and her descendants (each of whom was female, and each of whom inherited the gift of solo reproduction) are the present inhabitants of Herland. Over time, the women of Herland developed a peaceful, orderly, highly efficient society in which competition, crime, and antisocial behavior are unknown. As befits a society of mothers, childbearing is the greatest honor of the women’s lives, as well as their highest duty. In fact, Herland is essentially a giant family, an organic community pursuing the common good. As such, property is held in common, there is a loose system of authority based on experience and wisdom, and the wellbeing and education of children are the highest priorities.
As the men, especially Van and Jeff, come to learn about and appreciate the social structure of Herland, the women begin to learn, through the men, about the outside world. All three men begin with the assumption that any comparison of Herland and the “civilized” world of Europe and the United States will be to the advantage of the latter. Van and Jeff, however, soon realize that, in comparison to the society they have left behind, Herland is a veritable paradise. The women of Herland are shocked to hear of the poverty, disease, exploitation, and violence of the modern world, so much so that the men find themselves dissembling out of shame and often hiding the full truth. The women are able to perceive the true nature of the society the men describe, despite their reticence: women are particularly exploited in the competitive, money-driven modern world, as their maternal function is used to keep them in a subordinate position. The women are horrified to learn of the practice of abortion, for example, seeing it as violence against motherhood itself. The more Van and Jeff see of Herland, the more they are convinced of its goodness and of the fundamental sickness of their own society. Terry, however, refuses to see anything good in Herland apart from the beauty of its inhabitants. Terry is convinced that women are naturally subordinate to men and that women, in fact, desire to be “mastered” by men. The very existence of Herland is an affront to Terry’s sensibilities, and the more he learns of it, the more he resents the “unnatural” state of affairs.
The women of Herland are themselves concerned about their lack of men, feeling that their society would benefit from a masculine perspective and contribution. Accordingly, Celis, Alima, and Ellador are encouraged to continue the courtship the men had so crudely begun upon their first arrival. The primary obstacle the lovers have to overcome is the assumption, by the men, that theirs is the active, dominant role in the relationship. The young women see themselves as equal partners with the men and cannot understand why the men would want it any other way. Jeff is a romantic, full of chivalry and southern notions of gallantry, and his tendency to put women on a pedestal sometimes becomes condescending and hampers his relationship with Celis. Jeff is, however, the most ardent convert to the ways of Herland. Terry, in contrast, woos Alima in a brusque, aggressive way, convinced that she desires a “masterful” man and that all men should have a submissive mate. Alima is fascinated by Terry, but wary; the two quarrel and make up often. Van and Ellador have the best, most equal relationship, soon becoming best friends and true lovers. The entire society of Herland watches the three couples with great interest, seeing that the outcome of the experiment could determine the future of Herland and mark their return to a “bi-sexual” state.
At the insistence of the men, a marriage ceremony is arranged for the three couples. After the wedding, the women are uncomfortable with the idea of “private life,” preferring to remain part of the larger community. They are also confused by the notion of nonprocreative sexual activity. The men respond to this new challenge in different ways. Jeff is a thorough believer in the superiority of Herland. Van wants to find some way to combine the best aspects of companionate marriage as he understands it, including romantic and sexual intimacy, with the socially minded attitude of Herland, in which the needs of the larger group always prevail. Ellador shares this desire, feeling romantic love for Van along with her familial desire to procreate for the community. Terry is outraged by Alima’s continued insistence on her own autonomy, feeling that he now “owns” Alima by marriage.
Terry’s sexual advances become more aggressive and even brutal, and Alima is forced to defend herself physically. The leaders of Herland are shocked by Terry’s attempted rape of Alima and decide to exile the men. Celis is now pregnant, much to the joy of the Herlanders, and so Jeff decides to stay behind with her forever. Terry is more than pleased to leave Herland behind. Though he threatens at first to return in force, he eventually promises to keep the location of the plateau a secret. Ellador decides to accompany Van in order to see the outer world in his company and to report back on what she observes to Herland. Taking the airplane on which the men first arrived, Terry, Van, and Ellador return to the troubled world below."
Nucleus,"In Part I of The Elegant Universe, “The Edge of Knowledge,” Greene introduces the central problem of modern physics: the incompatibility of Einstein’s theory of general relativity with quantum mechanics. He then lists the physical curiosities—properties of the motion of light, gravity, and the behavior of particles at the subatomic level—that have prevented physicists from establishing a single coherent theory for how the universe works. For most of the twentieth century, physicists contented themselves with describing either the most small-scale or the most large-scale workings of the cosmos, but never both simultaneously. At the end of this section, Greene describes both the objectives and the promise of superstring theory, which attempts to merge the laws of general relativity with those of quantum mechanics.
Without dismissing the importance of electrons and quarks, which are the basis of quantum mechanics, superstring theory depicts the smallest particles in the universe not as dots but as tiny strings of energy. These strings are one hundred billion billion (a quintillion) times smaller than a single atomic nucleus. They vibrate in different patterns, which in turn produce different particle properties. But because these strings are too tiny to locate with current scientific tools, superstring theory is not yet predictable or testable. Therefore, physicists like Greene must work with approximations of equations until more information has been verified. Still, the promise of string theory is tremendous. Only string theory’s conceptual framework offers any possibility of unifying general relativity and quantum mechanics into one complete understanding of how the universe works.
In Part II, “The Dilemma of Space, Time, and the Quanta,” Greene reviews the basic precepts of the two competing theories—first, Einstein’s special and general relativity, and then the “microscopic weirdness” of quantum mechanics. General relativity presupposes a smooth surface of space, but at an ultramicroscopic level (which quantum mechanics has helped unveil), the spatial fabric is subject to violent undulations known as “quantum foam.” Greene also discusses the basic principle of quantum mechanics: the uncertainty principle. The uncertainty principle predicts the impossibility of knowing both the exact location and the velocity of a particle at any given time. Greene goes over the four fundamental forces—the strong force, the weak force, electromagnetism, and gravity—and he describes the complexity of incorporating gravity into the standard model of the first three. In the last chapter of this section, Greene stresses the necessity of finding a new theory that revises both general relativity and quantum mechanics. Like many of his colleagues, Greene simply cannot accept that the universe is, at its core, divided into two contradictory theoretical frameworks.
In Part III, “The Cosmic Symphony,” Greene discusses in detail how superstring theory works. He employs many musical metaphors to suggest how strings “harmonize” or bring together the most puzzling aspects of the cosmos. After praising the elegance and economy of the theory, Greene gives a brief history of its first incarnation in the 1970s, when it was referred to as the bosonic string theory. He also explains the subsequent revisions the theory underwent during the first superstring revolution in 1984. Greene then describes how supersymmetry— a concept that predicts the existence of superpartners that correspond with all known particles—transformed string theory into superstring theory.
With these basics covered, Greene proceeds to one of the oddest claims of string theory: the theory that the universe contains far more dimensions than we can perceive. In its current form, superstring theory postulates the existence of eleven total dimensions: ten of space and one of time. According to the theory, equations of quantum theory can mesh beautifully with relativity if we assume the existence of eleven dimensions. Greene concludes “The Cosmic Symphony” by analyzing the central difficulty of string theory—namely, the lack of experimental evidence for superstring theory. He describes the efforts he and his colleagues have made to develop string theory and refine its underlying mathematical principles. He shows what a Calabi-Yau space (the six-dimensional shape that physicists believe the additional, curled-up dimensions of space will form) may look like.
Part IV, “String Theory and the Fabric of Spacetime,” is the most complicated and involved section of the book. Greene begins with an overview of quantum geometry and the new kind of math that must emerge to explain the universe on an ultramicroscopic scale. He argues that contrary to what physicists previously believed, the fabric of space can be ripped and torn with no catastrophic consequences. He also covers the second superstring revolution, which shows that all five string theories are really part of a single, unified framework called M-theory. It is fitting that no one knows what the “M” signifies, because M-theory is one of the most radical, incompletely understood theories ever to evolve. M-theory proposes the unification of gravity with the three nongravitational forces. It is an extension of string theory that suggests the elementary particles of the universe might include, in addition to strings, two-dimensional membranes and three-dimensional blobs of varying size. Greene ends his discussion of the latest advances in superstring theory by discussing its cosmological implications, what it might reveal about the origins of the universe.
Part V, “Unification in the Twenty-First Century,” concludes the book. It covers the prospects of string theory in the twenty-first century. It describes the advances Greene and other string theorists hope to make in unveiling a single theory to explain the entire universe. For all his optimistic predictions, however, Greene never hesitates to admit that because of its complexity, superstring theory might not be fully understood for many years."
Hearted,"Heart of Darkness centers around Marlow, an introspective sailor, and his journey up the Congo River to meet Kurtz, reputed to be an idealistic man of great abilities. Marlow takes a job as a riverboat captain with the Company, a Belgian concern organized to trade in the Congo. As he travels to Africa and then up the Congo, Marlow encounters widespread inefficiency and brutality in the Company’s stations. The native inhabitants of the region have been forced into the Company’s service, and they suffer terribly from overwork and ill treatment at the hands of the Company’s agents. The cruelty and squalor of imperial enterprise contrasts sharply with the impassive and majestic jungle that surrounds the white man’s settlements, making them appear to be tiny islands amidst a vast darkness.
Marlow arrives at the Central Station, run by the general manager, an unwholesome, conspiratorial character. He finds that his steamship has been sunk and spends several months waiting for parts to repair it. His interest in Kurtz grows during this period. The manager and his favorite, the brickmaker, seem to fear Kurtz as a threat to their position. Kurtz is rumored to be ill, making the delays in repairing the ship all the more costly. Marlow eventually gets the parts he needs to repair his ship, and he and the manager set out with a few agents (whom Marlow calls pilgrims because of their strange habit of carrying long, wooden staves wherever they go) and a crew of cannibals on a long, difficult voyage up the river. The dense jungle and the oppressive silence make everyone aboard a little jumpy, and the occasional glimpse of a native village or the sound of drums works the pilgrims into a frenzy.
Marlow and his crew come across a hut with stacked firewood, together with a note saying that the wood is for them but that they should approach cautiously. Shortly after the steamer has taken on the firewood, it is surrounded by a dense fog. When the fog clears, the ship is attacked by an unseen band of natives, who fire arrows from the safety of the forest. The African helmsman is killed before Marlow frightens the natives away with the ship’s steam whistle. Not long after, Marlow and his companions arrive at Kurtz’s Inner Station, expecting to find him dead, but a half-crazed Russian trader, who meets them as they come ashore, assures them that everything is fine and informs them that he is the one who left the wood. The Russian claims that Kurtz has enlarged his mind and cannot be subjected to the same moral judgments as normal people. Apparently, Kurtz has established himself as a god with the natives and has gone on brutal raids in the surrounding territory in search of ivory. The collection of severed heads adorning the fence posts around the station attests to his “methods.” The pilgrims bring Kurtz out of the station-house on a stretcher, and a large group of native warriors pours out of the forest and surrounds them. Kurtz speaks to them, and the natives disappear into the woods.
The manager brings Kurtz, who is quite ill, aboard the steamer. A beautiful native woman, apparently Kurtz’s mistress, appears on the shore and stares out at the ship. The Russian implies that she is somehow involved with Kurtz and has caused trouble before through her influence over him. The Russian reveals to Marlow, after swearing him to secrecy, that Kurtz had ordered the attack on the steamer to make them believe he was dead in order that they might turn back and leave him to his plans. The Russian then leaves by canoe, fearing the displeasure of the manager. Kurtz disappears in the night, and Marlow goes out in search of him, finding him crawling on all fours toward the native camp. Marlow stops him and convinces him to return to the ship. They set off down the river the next morning, but Kurtz’s health is failing fast.
Marlow listens to Kurtz talk while he pilots the ship, and Kurtz entrusts Marlow with a packet of personal documents, including an eloquent pamphlet on civilizing the savages which ends with a scrawled message that says, “Exterminate all the brutes!” The steamer breaks down, and they have to stop for repairs. Kurtz dies, uttering his last words—“The horror! The horror!”—in the presence of the confused Marlow. Marlow falls ill soon after and barely survives. Eventually he returns to Europe and goes to see Kurtz’s Intended (his fiancée). She is still in mourning, even though it has been over a year since Kurtz’s death, and she praises him as a paragon of virtue and achievement. She asks what his last words were, but Marlow cannot bring himself to shatter her illusions with the truth. Instead, he tells her that Kurtz’s last word was her name."
Prisoner,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban opens on the night before Harry's thirteenth birthday, when he receives gifts by Owl Post from his friends at school. The next morning at breakfast, Harry sees on television that a man named Black is on the loose from prison. At this time, Aunt Marge comes to stay with the Dursleys, and she insults Harry's parents numerous times. Harry accidentally causes her to inflate. Harry leaves the Dursley's house and is picked up by the Knight Bus, but only after an alarming sighting of a large, black dog. The Knight Bus drops Harry off at Diagon Alley, where he is greeted by Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic. He rents a room and awaits the start of school. In Diagon Alley, Harry finishes his schoolwork, admires a Firebolt broomstick in the window of a shop, and after some time, finds his friends Ron and Hermione. At a pet shop, Hermione buys a cat named Crookshanks, who chases Scabbers, Ron's aging pet rat. Ron is most displeased. The night before they all head off to Hogwarts, Harry overhears Ron's parents discussing the fact that Sirius Black is after Harry.
The students board the Hogwarts Express train and are stopped once by an entity called a Dementor. Harry faints and is revived by Professor Lupin, the new defense against the dark arts teacher. Soon afterward, the students arrive at Hogwarts and classes begin. In divination class, Professor Trelawney foresees Harry's death by reading tealeaves and finding the representation of a Grim, a large black dog symbolizing death. In the care of magical creatures class, Hagrid introduces the students to Hippogriffs, large, deeply dignified crosses between horses and eagles. Malfoy insults one of these beasts, Buckbeak, and is attacked. Malfoy drags out the injury in an attempt to have Hagrid fired and Buckbeak put to sleep. In Defense Against the Dark Arts, Professor Lupin leads the class in a defeat of a Boggart, which changes shape to appear as the viewer's greatest fear. For Lupin, it turns into an orb, for Ron, a spider. Harry doesn't have a chance to fight it.
During a Hogwarts visit to Hogsmeade, a wizard village which Harry is unable to visit because he has no permission slip, Harry has tea with Professor Lupin. Harry discovers that the reason he wasn't allowed to fight the Boggart was that Lupin had worried that it would take the shape of Voldemort. This concern catches Harry by surprise, because Harry had been thinking even more fearfully about the awful Dementors. Snape brings Lupin a steaming potion, which Lupin drinks, much to Harry's alarm. Later that night, Sirius Black breaks into Hogwarts and destroys the Fat Lady portrait that guards Gryffindor Tower. The students spend the night sleeping in the Great Hall while the teachers search the castle. Soon afterwards, Quidditch moves into full swing, and Gryffindor House plays against Hufflepuff. During the game, Harry spies the large black dog, and seconds later he sees a hoard of Dementors. He loses consciousness and falls off his broomstick. Harry wakes to find that his trusty broomstick had flown into the Whomping Willow and been smashed in his fall, and the game itself had lost. Later, Harry learns from Lupin that the Dementors affect Harry so much because Harry's past is so horrible.
During the next Hogsmeade visit, from which Harry is forbidden, Fred and George Weasley give Harry the Marauder's map, written by the mysterious quartet of Moony, Prongs, Wormtail and Padfoot. This map leads him through a secret passageway into Hogsmeade, where he rejoins Ron and Hermione. Inside the Hogsmeade tavern, Harry overhears Cornelius Fudge discussing Sirius Black's responsibility for Harry's parents' deaths, as well as for the death of another Hogwarts student, Peter Pettigrew, who was blown to bits, leaving only a finger. Back at Hogwarts, Harry learns that Hagrid received a notice saying that Buckbeak, the hippogriff who attacked Malfoy, is going to be put on trial, and Hagrid is inconsolable. The winter holidays roll around. For Christmas, Harry receives a Firebolt, the most impressive racing broomstick in the world. Much to his and Ron's dismay, Hermione reports the broomstick to Professor McGonagall, who takes it away out of fear that it may have been sent (and cursed) by Sirius Black.
After the holidays, Harry begins working with Professor Lupin to fight Dementors with the Patronus charm; he is moderately successful, but still not entirely confident in his ability to ward them off. Soon before the game against Ravenclaw, Harry's broomstick is returned to him, and as Ron takes it up to the dormitory, he discovers evidence that Scabbers has been eaten by Crookshanks. Ron is furious at Hermione. Soon afterwards, Gryffindor plays Ravenclaw in Quidditch. Harry, on his Firebolt, triumphs, winning the game. Once all the students have gone to bed, Sirius Black breaks into Harry's dormitory and slashes the curtain around Ron's bed. Several days later, Hagrid invites Harry and Ron over for tea and scolds them for shunning Hermione on account of Scabbers and the Firebolt. They feel slightly guilty, but not terrible. Soon Harry, under his invisibility cloak, meets Ron during a Hogsmeade trip; when he returns, Snape catches him and confiscates his Marauder's Map. Lupin saves Harry from Snape's rage, but afterwards he reprimands him severely for risking his safety for ""a bag of magic tricks."" As Harry leaves Lupin's office, he runs into Hermione, who informs him that Buckbeak's execution date has been set. Ron, Hermione, and Harry are reconciled in their efforts to help Hagrid. Around this time, Hermione is exceptionally stressed by all of her work, and in a day she slaps Malfoy for picking on Hagrid and she quits Divination, concluding that Professor Trelawney is a great fraud. Days later, Gryffindor beats Slytherin in a dirty game of Quidditch, winning the Cup.
Exams roll around, and during Harry's pointless Divination exam, Professor Trelawney predicts the return of Voldemort's servant before midnight. Ron, Hermione, and Harry shield themselves in Harry's invisibility cloak and head off to comfort Hagrid before the execution. While at his cabin, Hermione discovers Scabbers in Hagrid's milk jug. They leave, and Buckbeak is executed. As Ron, Harry, Harry and Hermione are leaving Hagrid's house and reeling from the sound of the axe, the large black dog approaches them, pounces on Ron, and drags him under the Whomping Willow. Harry and Hermione and Crookshanks dash down after them; oddly, Crookshanks knows the secret knob to press to still the flailing tree. They move through an underground tunnel and arrive at the Shrieking Shack. They find that the black dog has turned into Sirius Black and is in a room with Ron. Harry, Ron, and Hermione manage to disarm Black, and before Harry can kill Black, avenging his parents' deaths, Professor Lupin enters the room and disarms him. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are aghast as Lupin and Black exchange a series of nods and embrace.
Once the three students calm down enough to listen, Lupin and Black explain everything. Lupin is a werewolf who remains tame through a special steaming potion made for him by Snape. While Lupin was a student at Hogwarts, his best friends, James Potter, Sirius Black, and Peter Pettigrew, became animagi (humans able to take on animal forms) so that they could romp the grounds with Lupin at the full moon. They explain how Snape once followed Lupin toward his transformation site in a practical joke set up by Sirius, and was rescued narrowly by James Potter. At this moment, Snape reveals himself from underneath Harry's dropped invisibility cloak, but Harry, Ron, and Hermione disarm him, rendering him unconscious. Lupin and Black then explain that the real murderer of Harry's parents is not Black, but Peter Pettigrew, who has been presumed dead but really hidden all these years disguised as Scabbers. Lupin transforms Scabbers into Pettigrew, who squeals and hedges but ultimately confesses, revealing himself to be Voldemort's servant, and Black to be innocent. They all travel back to Hogwarts, but at the sight of the full moon, Lupin, who has forgotten to take his controlling tonic (the steaming liquid), turns into a werewolf. Sirius Black responds by turning into the large black dog in order to protect Harry, Ron, and Hermione from Lupin. As Black returns from driving the werewolf into the woods, a swarm of Dementors approaches, and Black is paralyzed with fear. One of the Dementors prepares to suck the soul out of Harry, whose patronus charm is simply not strong enough. Out of somewhere comes a patronus that drives the Dementors away. Harry faints.
Harry awakens in the hospital wing to hear Snape and Cornelius Fudge discussing the fact that Sirius Black is about to be given the fatal Dementor's Kiss. Harry and Hermione protest, claiming Black's innocence, but to no avail; then Dumbledore enters the room, shoos out the others, and mysteriously suggests that Harry and Hermione travel back through Hermione's time-turning device, and save both Black and Buckbeak. Hermione turns her hour-glass necklace back three turns, and Harry and Hermione are thrust into the past, where they rescue Buckbeak shortly before his execution. From a hiding place in the forest, Harry watches the Dementor sequence and discovers that he had been the one who conjured the patronus, and he is touched and confused to note that his patronus had taken the shape of a stag that he recognizes instantly as Prongs, his father's animagi form. After saving his past self from the Dementors, Harry and Hermione fly to the tower where Black is imprisoned, and they rescue Black, sending him away to freedom on Buckbeak's back. The next day, Harry is saddened to learn that Professor Lupin is leaving Hogwarts because of the previous night's scare. Dumbledore meets with Harry and gives him wise fatherly advice on the events that have happened. On the train ride home, Harry receives an owl- post letter from Sirius that contains a Hogsmeade permission letter, words of confirmation that he is safe in hiding with Buckbeak and that he was, in fact, the sender of the Firebolt, and a small pet owl for Ron. Harry feels slightly uplifted as he returns to spend his summer with the Dursleys."
Panama,"At the age of four, Catalina de Erauso, born in the Basque area of Spain in 1585, is placed in a Dominican convent, where she trains until the age of fifteen to become a nun. On March 18, 1600, Catalina runs away from the convent and fashions herself a suit of male clothes out of her convent garments. Thus she begins her life as a man.
She obtains a number of jobs, including one as a page for the king’s secretary. While in his employ, she encounters her father, who is petitioning for help in finding his missing daughter. Her father does not recognize her. She again tempts fate and returns to her old convent for mass, where her mother is in attendance. Catalina’s mother also does not recognize her.
Catalina’s journeys through the New World begin when she meets her uncle, a sea captain who, not recognizing her, signs her on as a ship’s boy. Eventually Catalina flees the ship, stealing money from her uncle as she leaves for Panama, and embarks on a series of jobs and adventures. A number of violent episodes ensue, which often lead Catalina to flee into a local church for safety. At that time, police were barred from invading the sanctity of a church, thus granting criminals inside sanctuary. Catalina’s tendency to get into violent and criminal scrapes leads her to take frequent advantage of this legal loophole.
Catalina also has a number of problematic encounters with young ladies. Some want to marry her, forcing her to ward off their advances. But in one situation, Catalina is dismissed from her position for inappropriate behavior with the sister-in-law of her master. She signs up for the army and soon travels to Chile, where she becomes a soldier for her brother, who does not recognize her. Although they generally get along well, after three years they fight over a woman, and Catalina is banished to another town. She manages to distinguish herself in battle, both for her bravery and for her propensity for violence. She kills many people, both on and off the battlefield, and is constantly running from the law.
When a friend asks her to be his second in a duel, she agrees. During the course of the duel, she kills the other man’s second, who turns out to be her own brother. She retreats to the church to avoid arrest, and from there, wracked with sorrow, she watches her brother’s funeral. After months of hiding out in the church, Catalina leaves town and joins up with two other army deserters, who eventually die of starvation during their journey. Catalina is rescued by a half-Indian woman who wants Catalina to marry her daughter. At the same time, a local vicar tries to persuade her to marry his niece. Although she accepts their gifts, she eventually abandons them both.
Catalina assists in suppressing the Alonso Ibáñezi uprising and is part of a bloody battle where thousands of Indians are butchered. She is accused of committing a crime that she is innocent of, and although she is tortured, she refuses to admit to it. Soon after, she is accused of a murder that she actually has committed, but she refuses to admit to this crime either. She is nearly put to death until a fellow Basque halts the execution.
In Bolivia, the daughter of a nun begs Catalina to help her escape her husband, who is about to kill her for infidelity. The husband then tries to kill them both, but Catalina gets the woman to the safety of her mother’s convent. Catalina then goes to Peru to investigate crimes in the area. Soon after, she kills a man for insulting her and is sentenced to death. Due to a technicality in the church doctrine, she gains her freedom by taking communion and spitting it into her hand, holding onto the host until she is taken into a church, where she is granted sanctuary.
In Lima, she joins Spanish troops who are being attacked by the Dutch and then returns to the city of Cuzco, where she gets into a bloody fight over a game of cards. She kills her opponent, “the Cid,” who inflicts serious wounds on her as well. Thinking she is going to die, she makes a full confession to a priest.
Although she survives, she is wanted by the law. Her brushes with the constables grow more and more dangerous, and she is eventually surrounded by officers who have been given orders to kill her. A bishop intervenes and takes Catalina into the safety of his house. Catalina finally admits to the bishop that she is a woman, and when he expresses doubts, she gamely offers to submit to a medical examination. During the examination, she is proven to be not only a woman but a virgin, and the bishop vows to help her.
She is sent to a nunnery while the church investigates her past to find out if she ever took vows to become a nun. Her story spreads far and wide, and by 1620 she is well known throughout Spain. When, two years later, it is confirmed that she never took her vows, she is allowed to leave the convent and begin her life as a Spanish celebrity. She goes to Madrid and presents herself to the king, who, in 1625, grants her a pension for her service to Spain.
Catalina travels to Rome, where she meets Pope Urban the Eighth and tells him about her life and travels. She tells him that she is a woman and a virgin, and he gives her permission to continue to dress in men’s clothing.
Catalina ends her memoir with a short tale about being confronted by two prostitutes, whom she insults because they address her as a woman."
Brought,"The protagonist, who is named Tim O’Brien, begins by describing an event that occurred in the middle of his Vietnam experience. “The Things They Carried” catalogs the variety of things his fellow soldiers in the Alpha Company brought on their missions. Several of these things are intangible, including guilt and fear, while others are specific physical objects, including matches, morphine, M-16 rifles, and M&M’s candy.
Throughout the collection, the same characters reappear in various stories. The first member of the Alpha Company to die is Ted Lavender, a “grunt,” or low-ranking soldier, who deals with his anxiety about the war by taking tranquilizers and smoking marijuana. Lavender is shot in the head on his way back from going to the bathroom, and his superior, Lieutenant Jimmy Cross, blames himself for the tragedy. When Lavender is shot, Cross is distracting himself with thoughts of Martha, a college crush. It is revealed in “Love” that Cross’s feelings for Martha, whom he dated once before leaving for Vietnam, were never reciprocated, and that even twenty years after the war, his guilt over Lavender’s death remains.
In “On the Rainy River,” the narrator, O’Brien, explains the series of events that led him to Vietnam in the first place. He receives his draft notice in June of 1968, and his feelings of confusion drive him north to the Canadian border, which he contemplates crossing so that he will not be forced to fight in a war in which he doesn’t believe. Sitting in a rowboat with the proprietor of the Tip Top Lodge, where he stays, O’Brien decides that his guilt about avoiding the war and fear of disappointing his family are more important than his political convictions. He soon leaves, going first back home to Worthington, Minnesota and later to Vietnam.
In addition to Ted Lavender, a few other members of the Alpha Company are killed during their mission overseas, including Curt Lemon, who is killed when he steps on a rigged mortar round. Though O’Brien is not close to Lemon, in “The Dentist,” he tells a story of how Lemon, who faints before a routine checkup with an army-issued dentist, tries to save face by insisting that a perfectly good tooth be pulled. Lee Strunk, another member of the company, dies from injuries he sustains by stepping on a landmine. In “Friends,” O’Brien remembers that before Strunk was fatally hurt, Strunk and Dave Jensen had made a pact that if either man were irreparably harmed, the other man would see that he was quickly killed. However, when Strunk is actually hurt, he begs Jensen to spare him, and Jensen complies. Instead of being upset by the news of his friend’s swift death en route to treatment, Jensen is relieved.
The death that receives the most attention in The Things They Carried is that of Kiowa, a much-loved member of the Alpha Company and one of O’Brien’s closest friends. In “Speaking of Courage,” the story of Kiowa’s death is relayed in retrospect through the memory of Norman Bowker, years after the war. As Bowker drives around a lake in his Iowa hometown, he thinks that he failed to save Kiowa, who was killed when a mortar round hit and caused him to sink headfirst into a marshy field. O’Brien realizes that he has dealt with his guilt over Kiowa’s death differently than Norman Bowker in “Notes.” Just before the end of the war, O’Brien receives a long letter from Bowker that says he hasn’t found a way to make life meaningful after the war. O’Brien resolves to tell Bowker’s story, and the story of Kiowa’s death, in order to negotiate his own feelings of guilt and hollowness.
Like “Love” and “Notes,” several of O’Brien’s stories are told from a perspective twenty years after the Vietnam War, when he is a forty-three-year-old writer living in Massachusetts. Exposure to the guilt of old friends like Jimmy Cross and Norman Bowker prompts him to write stories in order to understand what they were going through. But two stories, “The Man I Killed” and “Ambush,” are written so that O’Brien can confront his own guilt over killing a man with a grenade outside the village of My Khe. In “The Man I Killed,” O’Brien imagines the life of his victim, from his childhood to the way things would have turned out for him had O’Brien not spotted him on a path and thrown a grenade at his feet. In “Ambush,” O’Brien imagines how he might relay the story of the man he killed to his nine-year-old daughter, Kathleen. In this second story, O’Brien provides more details of the actual killing—including the sound of the grenade and his own feelings—and explains that even well after the fact, he hasn’t finished sorting out the experience.
In the last story, “The Lives of the Dead,” O’Brien gives another twist to his contention that stories have the power to save people. In the stories of Curt Lemon and Kiowa, O’Brien explains that his imagination allowed him to grapple successfully with his guilt and confusion over the death of his fourth-grade first love, Linda."
Latter,"The Scarlet Letter opens with a long preamble about how the book came to be written. The nameless narrator was the surveyor of the customhouse in Salem, Massachusetts. In the customhouse’s attic, he discovered a number of documents, among them a manuscript that was bundled with a scarlet, gold-embroidered patch of cloth in the shape of an “A.” The manuscript, the work of a past surveyor, detailed events that occurred some two hundred years before the narrator’s time. When the narrator lost his customs post, he decided to write a fictional account of the events recorded in the manuscript. The Scarlet Letter is the final product.
The story begins in seventeenth-century Boston, then a Puritan settlement. A young woman, Hester Prynne, is led from the town prison with her infant daughter, Pearl, in her arms and the scarlet letter “A” on her breast. A man in the crowd tells an elderly onlooker that Hester is being punished for adultery. Hester’s husband, a scholar much older than she is, sent her ahead to America, but he never arrived in Boston. The consensus is that he has been lost at sea. While waiting for her husband, Hester has apparently had an affair, as she has given birth to a child. She will not reveal her lover’s identity, however, and the scarlet letter, along with her public shaming, is her punishment for her sin and her secrecy. On this day Hester is led to the town scaffold and harangued by the town fathers, but she again refuses to identify her child’s father.
The elderly onlooker is Hester’s missing husband, who is now practicing medicine and calling himself Roger Chillingworth. He settles in Boston, intent on revenge. He reveals his true identity to no one but Hester, whom he has sworn to secrecy. Several years pass. Hester supports herself by working as a seamstress, and Pearl grows into a willful, impish child. Shunned by the community, they live in a small cottage on the outskirts of Boston. Community officials attempt to take Pearl away from Hester, but, with the help of Arthur Dimmesdale, a young and eloquent minister, the mother and daughter manage to stay together. Dimmesdale, however, appears to be wasting away and suffers from mysterious heart trouble, seemingly caused by psychological distress. Chillingworth attaches himself to the ailing minister and eventually moves in with him so that he can provide his patient with round-the-clock care. Chillingworth also suspects that there may be a connection between the minister’s torments and Hester’s secret, and he begins to test Dimmesdale to see what he can learn. One afternoon, while the minister sleeps, Chillingworth discovers a mark on the man’s breast (the details of which are kept from the reader), which convinces him that his suspicions are correct.
Dimmesdale’s psychological anguish deepens, and he invents new tortures for himself. In the meantime, Hester’s charitable deeds and quiet humility have earned her a reprieve from the scorn of the community. One night, when Pearl is about seven years old, she and her mother are returning home from a visit to a deathbed when they encounter Dimmesdale atop the town scaffold, trying to punish himself for his sins. Hester and Pearl join him, and the three link hands. Dimmesdale refuses Pearl’s request that he acknowledge her publicly the next day, and a meteor marks a dull red “A” in the night sky. Hester can see that the minister’s condition is worsening, and she resolves to intervene. She goes to Chillingworth and asks him to stop adding to Dimmesdale’s self-torment. Chillingworth refuses.
Hester arranges an encounter with Dimmesdale in the forest because she is aware that Chillingworth has probably guessed that she plans to reveal his identity to Dimmesdale. The former lovers decide to flee to Europe, where they can live with Pearl as a family. They will take a ship sailing from Boston in four days. Both feel a sense of release, and Hester removes her scarlet letter and lets down her hair. Pearl, playing nearby, does not recognize her mother without the letter. The day before the ship is to sail, the townspeople gather for a holiday and Dimmesdale preaches his most eloquent sermon ever. Meanwhile, Hester has learned that Chillingworth knows of their plan and has booked passage on the same ship. Dimmesdale, leaving the church after his sermon, sees Hester and Pearl standing before the town scaffold. He impulsively mounts the scaffold with his lover and his daughter, and confesses publicly, exposing a scarlet letter seared into the flesh of his chest. He falls dead, as Pearl kisses him.
Frustrated in his revenge, Chillingworth dies a year later. Hester and Pearl leave Boston, and no one knows what has happened to them. Many years later, Hester returns alone, still wearing the scarlet letter, to live in her old cottage and resume her charitable work. She receives occasional letters from Pearl, who has married a European aristocrat and established a family of her own. When Hester dies, she is buried next to Dimmesdale. The two share a single tombstone, which bears a scarlet “A.”"
Want,"Oluo uses the introduction to establish herself as a Black woman who is both proud of her culture and constantly hindered by America’s racism and the social injustice that permeates its society. She is ready to demand change, as are many Black people in an internet age that allows the documentation and validation of their experiences. White people might find these conversations uncomfortable or even scary, but it is far past time for America to address white supremacy and its fundamental, systemic inequities. 
Social change cannot be made in America without considering race, because racial disparities permeate every aspect of society. American society, and especially the American economy, rest on the premise that people of color are born inferior to white people. Even Obama’s election only reaffirmed white America’s denial of racism while spurring white people on to demand more in comparison with their Black and brown counterparts. Racism is systemic, affecting every part of American life. Individual exceptions do not invalidate the overall, cumulative experience of social inequality and oppression. White people do not experience racism, so they need to listen to people of color and trust the validity of their experiences. 
Racism is not limited to the fear or hatred that a white person might feel toward a Black person. It’s the system of inequality perpetuated by the government, business, and education. Only this definition offers the hope of systemic change while demanding that majority individuals face their privilege, their racism, and their role in the fight. Because America is a racist society, white people are guaranteed to make mistakes when talking about it. That fact cannot become an excuse to stop trying, although good intentions are no longer sufficient. White people must apologize and learn to do better when they make hurtful comments. A good start is for everyone to understand the extent of their privilege. The exercise is not intended to inflict guilt but to force everyone to realize the ways in which their lived experiences are different than those of others. That understanding can help everyone demand change in the places where they exercise power.  
People’s identities are compilations of many factors. Intersectionality is a viewpoint that acknowledges all of these factors so people can be respected and valued for all of their identities, whether Black, mixed, male, female, feminist, scholar, artist, and so on. It’s a tough task because it slows social progress and demands empathy, but without it, any social progress only establishes a new hierarchy that then serves to oppress another group of people.  
The book’s central chapters address a variety of racial topics. Police in America treat Black people differently because of racism’s systemic nature. White people have trouble acknowledging this fact because doing so requires they admit the ways racism benefits them. Affirmative action is an admittedly flawed program that nevertheless benefits minorities and should be continued but also advanced. Teachers and school administrators see Black children as larger, older, more aggressive, and less intelligent than their white counterparts, so Black children are disciplined more often and more harshly, leading to their criminalization and institutionalization. The word “n*****” is intrinsically harmful, and even free speech does not justify its use. Also painful is the adoption of a culture’s customs (i.e., cultural appropriation), while benefiting financially from them, not acknowledging their historical development, and not having to share in the struggles that formed them. Touching a Black person’s hair continues America’s racist history of treating Black people’s bodies as white people’s property. It denies a Black person’s autonomy, agency, and right to personal space.  
In the final five chapters, Oluo addresses the painful effects of cumulative acts of systemic racism, beginning with microaggressions. These thoughtless or cruel comments and behaviors accumulate, resulting in psychological damage. Black people have the right to call out these comments and behaviors and to demand an apology. Oluo then discusses that despite the best efforts of previous generations, young Black people have inherited a deeply unjust America, and adults must trust them to carry the battle forward. Racism’s systemic nature is maintained in part by the argument that some Black people, such as Martin Luther King, Jr., are “good” activists who deserve social equality while others, such as Malcolm X, are not. The dichotomy is false; either every person is equal, or America is doomed to forever be a white supremacy. Finally, Oluo encourages her readers to move beyond talking about racism and to take actions to make society truly equal for all."
Regretted,"Nora Seed, a 36-year-old music store clerk, is struggling to cope with overwhelming regret about the state of her life. In a period of just over a day, Nora’s cat dies, she loses her job at the music store, she has a confrontational run-in with her former bandmate, and she loses her lone piano student. Her brother Joe is avoiding her, her best friend Izzy isn’t responding to her text messages, and even her next-door neighbor, old Mr. Banerjee, says he doesn’t need Nora to help him with his medications anymore. Her parents have passed away, her father when she was a teenager, and her mother just a few years ago. After her mother’s death, Nora left her ex-fiancé, Dan, just two days before they were supposed to be married. Nora surveys her life and sees only pain, grief, and regret. She decides that she has nothing left to live for. She leaves a note, makes a final post on social media, and attempts to kill herself.
When Nora awakes from her attempt, she finds herself in front of a strange building. When she enters, all she can see in every direction is books. She encounters Mrs. Elm, her beloved high-school librarian who comforted her when Nora’s father passed away. Mrs. Elm explains that Nora is in a place in between life and death called the Midnight Library. She tells Nora that time doesn’t move here, and when Nora examines her watch, she sees that it is frozen at midnight. Mrs. Elm introduces Nora to The Book of Regrets, which articulates everything Nora has regretted in her life. The other books contain infinite variations of Nora’s life. Any book she chooses will allow her to see how her life would have turned out if she had made different choices. As soon as Nora feels disappointed in a life she visits, she will return to the Midnight Library. Nora still wants to die and is uninterested in the library, but Mrs. Elm encourages her to pick a book anyway. The first life Nora visits is the one in which she married Dan, and they own a pub together in the English countryside.
In her life with Dan, Nora is impressed to see that they have accomplished Dan’s dream of owning a pub in the English countryside. She quickly learns, however, that Dan cheated on her, and in the course of their interactions, Nora remembers how difficult her relationship with Dan often was. She wonders if they’ve outgrown each other, and she returns to the Midnight Library, where she is still filled with despair. Mrs. Elm coaches her to think of another life she might want to visit, and Nora chooses one in which she has kept her cat Volts inside, hoping he would live longer. In that life, she immediately finds that Volts is dead beneath her bed. She returns to the Midnight Library angry with Mrs. Elm. Mrs. Elm explains that Volts would have died in any life because he had a heart condition. Nora learns that she was a good cat owner to Volts, and her regret about not taking good enough care of him disappears from The Book of Regrets.
Nora continues to visit many iterations of her life. She sees that if she had gone to Australia with her best friend then Izzy would have died in a car wreck on the way to Nora’s birthday party. If she became an Olympic swimmer as her father had wanted, her father would have lived much longer, but her mother would have died much sooner. In that life, Nora has all the trappings of power and is poised to give a talk about success to a room full of thousands of people. But she recognizes that this successful life is lonely, and in many ways, she’s still suffering there. 
Next, Nora sees the life she would have had if she had become a glaciologist, a dream she had when she was very young. There, she has a near-death encounter with a polar bear, and facing death makes her realize that she truly wants to live. She also encounters another person who is sliding between lives, Hugo, who shares his observations about the nature of reality. She leaves that life to experience what it would be like if her band with her brother, The Labyrinths, had made it big. She’s a wildly successful rock star with millions of Instagram followers. She briefly enjoys the trappings of fame before learning that she’s embroiled in a complicated series of scandals and tragedies. When she learns that Joe died of a drug overdose two years prior, she is transported back to the Midnight Library.
Nora slides into alternate lives many times, and she begins to enjoy the process of learning more and more about herself and the world. However, after a while, she begins to lose herself and feels as though she wants to find a life that she can settle into. She slides into a beautiful life, with her loving husband Ash and daughter Molly, work she enjoys, and a nice home. It’s a life filled with love and ease, and she reminds herself again and again that it is a good life. As she visits the neighborhood from her root life, Nora sees the positive impacts her small actions have had on others. Nora realizes that no matter how good her life with Ash and Molly is, she didn’t earn it. Though she badly wants to stay and feels deep love for her family, Nora can’t stop herself from sliding back to the library.
Distraught, Nora begs Mrs. Elm to return her to the good life, but the Midnight Library is falling apart. The books are all catching on fire. Nora’s watch starts keeping time again, and Mrs. Elm says it’s possible that Nora is dying in her root life. But Nora deeply wants to live. She races to the book of her root life and writes “I AM ALIVE” on one of its blank pages. With that, the Midnight Library disappears, and Nora finds herself on the brink of death in her root life. She seeks out help from her neighbor and ends up in the hospital. Nora reconciles with her brother, who begs her not to leave him again, and with Izzy, who wants to catch up. Nora is filled with gratitude. She visits Mrs. Elm, and they play a game of chess, reflecting that one never knows how the game, or life, will end."
Financial,"A Raisin in the Sun portrays a few weeks in the life of the Youngers, a Black family living on the South Side of Chicago in the 1950s. When the play opens, the Youngers are about to receive an insurance check for $10,000. This money comes from the deceased Mr. Younger’s life insurance policy. Each of the adult members of the family has an idea as to what he or she would like to do with this money. The matriarch of the family, Mama, wants to buy a house to fulfill a dream she shared with her husband. Mama’s son, Walter Lee, would rather use the money to invest in a liquor store with his friends. He believes that the investment will solve the family’s financial problems forever. Walter’s wife, Ruth, agrees with Mama, however, and hopes that she and Walter can provide more space and opportunity for their son, Travis. Finally, Beneatha, Walter’s sister and Mama’s daughter, wants to use the money for her medical school tuition. She also wishes that her family members were not so interested in assimilating into the white world. Beneatha instead tries to find her identity by looking back to the past and to Africa.
As the play progresses, the Youngers clash over their competing dreams. Ruth discovers that she is pregnant but fears that if she has the child, she will put more financial pressure on her family members. When Walter says nothing to Ruth’s admission that she is considering abortion, Mama puts a down payment on a house for the whole family. She believes that a bigger, brighter dwelling will help them all. This house is in Clybourne Park, an entirely white neighborhood. When the Youngers’ future neighbors find out that the Youngers are moving in, they send Mr. Lindner, from the Clybourne Park Improvement Association, to offer the Youngers money in return for staying away. The Youngers refuse the deal, even after Walter loses the rest of the money ($6,500) to his friend Willy Harris, who persuades Walter to invest in the liquor store and then runs off with his cash.
In the meantime, Beneatha rejects her suitor, George Murchison, whom she believes to be shallow and blind to the problems of race. Subsequently, she receives a marriage proposal from her Nigerian boyfriend, Joseph Asagai, who wants Beneatha to get a medical degree and move to Africa with him (Beneatha does not make her choice before the end of the play). The Youngers eventually move out of the apartment, fulfilling the family’s long-held dream. Their future seems uncertain and slightly dangerous, but they are optimistic and determined to live a better life. They believe that they can succeed if they stick together as a family and resolve to defer their dreams no longer."
Expressing,"Hercule Poirot, private detective and retired Belgian police officer, boards the Taurus Express train to Stamboul (Istanbul). On the train there are two other passengers, Mary Debenham and Colonel Arbuthnot. The two act as if they are strangers, but Poirot observes behavior that suggests that they are not. Poirot is suspicious of the couple. The train arrives in Stamboul and Poirot checks in at the Tokatlian Hotel. As soon as Poirot arrives he receives a telegram summoning him back to London. While waiting at the hotel for the next train, Poirot bumps into an old friend, M. Bouc, head of the Wagon Lit. M. Bouc arranges a space for Poirot on the Orient Express. In the dining room of the Tokatlian Hotel, Poirot first spots Ratchett and Hector McQueen eating dinner. Poirot know that Ratchett is an evil man and he describes him to M. Bouc as an animal.
Poirot board the Orient Express. He is forced to ride in a second-class cabin because the train is unusually full. Ratchett and Hector McQueen are also aboard the train. Ratchett approaches Poirot and asks if he will work for him, Ratchett tells Poirot he has been receiving threatening letters and that someone is trying to kill him. Poirot refuses the case. M. Bouc has taken the last first class cabin, but arranges to be moved to a separate coach and gives Poirot his space in first class. The first night Poirot sleeps in first class, he observes some strange occurrences. Early in the morning, Poirot is wakened by a cry from Ratchett's compartment next to him. The wagon lit conductor responds knocks on Ratchett's door and a voice from inside responds, ""Ce n'est rien. Je me suis trompe"" (It is nothing. I am mistaken). Poirot has difficulty sleeping because there is a peculiar silence on the train. Mrs. Hubbard rings her bell and tells the conductor a man is in her room. Poirot rings his bell for water and is informed by the conductor that the train is stuck in a snow bank. Poirot hears a loud thump next door.
The next morning, the train still stopped, M. Bouc informs Poirot that Ratchett has been murdered and the murderer is still aboard the train. Poirot tells M. Bouc he will investigate the case. Poirot first examines Ratchett's body and compartment. Ratchett has twelve stab wounds. The window is left open in Ratchett's compartment, presumably to make the investigators think the murderer escaped out the window, but there are no footprints outside the window in the snow. A handkerchief with the initial ""H"" is found in the compartment, a pipe cleaner, a round match different from the matches Ratchett used and a charred piece of paper with the name ""Armstrong"" on it.
The piece of paper with the word Armstrong on it helps Poirot figure out who Ratchett really is and why someone would want to murder him. A few years back, a man named Cassetti kidnapped a three-year old girl, Daisy Armstrong. Cassetti collected a ransom from the wealthy Armstrong family, but killed the child anyways. Poirot concludes that Ratchett is Cassetti.
The interviews start with the Wagon Lit conductor, then Hector McQueen. Poirot knows that McQueen is involved with the case because he knows about the Armstrong note found in Ratchett's compartment, Hector is surprised that Poirot found the note because he thought it had been completely destroyed. He interviews Masterman and then Mrs. Hubbard. Mrs. Hubbard claims that the murderer was in her cabin. All of the passengers give Poirot suitable alibis during their interviews, although a few suspicious elements are brought to light: many passengers observed a woman in a red kimono walking down the hallway the night of the murder, but no one admits they have a red kimono. Mrs. Hubbard tells Poirot she had Greta Ohlsson lock the communicating door between she and Ratchett. Hildegarde Schmidt bumped into a stranger wearing a Wagon Lit jacket.
Poirot checks every passenger's luggage. During the check he notices a few interesting things: the label on Countess Andrenyi's luggage is wet, a Wagon Lit uniform is found in Hildegarde Schmidt's bag and, lastly, the red kimono is found in Poirot's own luggage.
After the luggage check, Poirot, Dr. Constantine and M. Bouc review the facts of the case and develop a list of questions. With the evidence and questions in mind, Poirot sits and thinks about the case. When he surfaces from a somewhat trance-like state, Poirot has discovered the solution to the case. Before he reveals this solution in full, he calls in several people and reveals their true identities. Poirot discovers Countess Andrenyi is Helena Goldenberg, aunt of Daisy Armstrong. She wet her luggage label and obscured her name, in an effort to conceal her identity. Also, Mary Debenham was Daisy's governess, Antonio Foscanelli was the Armstrong's chaffer, Masterman the valet, and Greta Ohlsson was Daisy Armstrong's nurse. Princess Dragomiroff claims her handkerchief from Poirot, the same found in Ratchett's compartment.
Poirot gathers all of the passengers into the dining car and propounds two possible solutions. The fist solution is that a stranger entered the train at Vincovci and killed Ratchett. The second solution is that all of the passengers aboard the Orient Express were involved with the murder. He argues that twelve of the thirteen passengers, all close to the Armstrong case, killed Ratchett to avenge the murder of Daisy Armstrong. Mrs. Hubbard, revealed as Linda Arden, admits that the second solution is correct. Poirot suggests that M. Bouc and Dr. Constantine tell the police that the first solution is correct to protect the family. M. Bouc and Dr. Constantine accept Poirot's suggestion."
Served,"Beloved begins in 1873 in Cincinnati, Ohio, where Sethe, a former slave, has been living with her eighteen-year-old daughter Denver. Sethe’s mother-in-law, Baby Suggs, lived with them until her death eight years earlier. Just before Baby Suggs’s death, Sethe’s two sons, Howard and Buglar, ran away. Sethe believes they fled because of the malevolent presence of an abusive ghost that has haunted their house at 124 Bluestone Road for years. Denver, however, likes the ghost, which everyone believes to be the spirit of her dead sister.
On the day the novel begins, Paul D, whom Sethe has not seen since they worked together on Mr. Garner’s Sweet Home plantation in Kentucky approximately twenty years earlier, stops by Sethe’s house. His presence resurrects memories that have lain buried in Sethe’s mind for almost two decades. From this point on, the story will unfold on two temporal planes. The present in Cincinnati constitutes one plane, while a series of events that took place around twenty years earlier, mostly in Kentucky, constitutes the other. This latter plane is accessed and described through the fragmented flashbacks of the major characters. Accordingly, we frequently read these flashbacks several times, sometimes from varying perspectives, with each successive narration of an event adding a little more information to the previous ones.
From these fragmented memories, the following story begins to emerge: Sethe, the protagonist, was born in the South to an African mother she never knew. When she is thirteen, she is sold to the Garners, who own Sweet Home and practice a comparatively benevolent kind of slavery. There, the other slaves, who are all men, lust after her but never touch her. Their names are Sixo, Paul D, Paul A, Paul F, and Halle. Sethe chooses to marry Halle, apparently in part because he has proven generous enough to buy his mother’s freedom by hiring himself out on the weekends. Together, Sethe and Halle have two sons, Howard and Buglar, as well as a baby daughter whose name we never learn. When she leaves Sweet Home, Sethe is also pregnant with a fourth child. After the eventual death of the proprietor, Mr. Garner, the widowed Mrs. Garner asks her sadistic, vehemently racist brother-in-law to help her run the farm. He is known to the slaves as schoolteacher, and his oppressive presence makes life on the plantation even more unbearable than it had been before. The slaves decide to run.
Schoolteacher and his nephews anticipate the slaves’ escape, however, and capture Paul D and Sixo. Schoolteacher kills Sixo and brings Paul D back to Sweet Home, where Paul D sees Sethe for what he believes will be the last time. She is still intent on running, having already sent her children ahead to her mother-in-law Baby Suggs’s house in Cincinnati. Invigorated by the recent capture, schoolteacher’s nephews seize Sethe in the barn and violate her, stealing the milk her body is storing for her infant daughter. Unbeknownst to Sethe, Halle is watching the event from a loft above her, where he lies frozen with horror. Afterward, Halle goes mad: Paul D sees him sitting by a churn with butter slathered all over his face. Paul D, meanwhile, is forced to suffer the indignity of wearing an iron bit in his mouth.
When schoolteacher finds out that Sethe has reported his and his nephews’ misdeeds to Mrs. Garner, he has her whipped severely, despite the fact that she is pregnant. Swollen and scarred, Sethe nevertheless runs away, but along the way she collapses from exhaustion in a forest. A white girl, Amy Denver, finds her and nurses her back to health. When Amy later helps Sethe deliver her baby in a boat, Sethe names this second daughter Denver after the girl who helped her. Sethe receives further help from Stamp Paid, who rows her across the Ohio River to Baby Suggs’s house. Baby Suggs cleans Sethe up before allowing her to see her three older children.
Sethe spends twenty-eight wonderful days in Cincinnati, where Baby Suggs serves as an unofficial preacher to the black community. On the last day, however, schoolteacher comes for Sethe to take her and her children back to Sweet Home. Rather than surrender her children to a life of dehumanizing slavery, she flees with them to the woodshed and tries to kill them. Only the third child, her older daughter, dies, her throat having been cut with a handsaw by Sethe. Sethe later arranges for the baby’s headstone to be carved with the word “Beloved.” The sheriff takes Sethe and Denver to jail, but a group of white abolitionists, led by the Bodwins, fights for her release. Sethe returns to the house at 124, where Baby Suggs has sunk into a deep depression. The community shuns the house, and the family continues to live in isolation.
Meanwhile, Paul D has endured torturous experiences in a chain gang in Georgia, where he was sent after trying to kill Brandywine, a slave owner to whom he was sold by schoolteacher. His traumatic experiences have caused him to lock away his memories, emotions, and ability to love in the “tin tobacco box” of his heart. One day, a fortuitous rainstorm allows Paul D and the other chain gang members to escape. He travels northward by following the blossoming spring flowers. Years later, he ends up on Sethe’s porch in Cincinnati.
Paul D’s arrival at 124 commences the series of events taking place in the present time frame. Prior to moving in, Paul D chases the house’s resident ghost away, which makes the already lonely Denver resent him from the start. Sethe and Paul D look forward to a promising future together, until one day, on their way home from a carnival, they encounter a strange young woman sleeping near the steps of 124. Most of the characters believe that the woman—who calls herself Beloved—is the embodied spirit of Sethe’s dead daughter, and the novel provides a wealth of evidence supporting this interpretation. Denver develops an obsessive attachment to Beloved, and Beloved’s attachment to Sethe is equally if not more intense. Paul D and Beloved hate each other, and Beloved controls Paul D by moving him around the house like a rag doll and by seducing him against his will.
When Paul D learns the story of Sethe’s “rough choice”—her infanticide—he leaves 124 and begins sleeping in the basement of the local church. In his absence, Sethe and Beloved’s relationship becomes more intense and exclusive. Beloved grows increasingly abusive, manipulative, and parasitic, and Sethe is obsessed with satisfying Beloved’s demands and making her understand why she murdered her. Worried by the way her mother is wasting away, Denver leaves the premises of 124 for the first time in twelve years in order to seek help from Lady Jones, her former teacher. The community provides the family with food and eventually organizes under the leadership of Ella, a woman who had worked on the Underground Railroad and helped with Sethe’s escape, in order to exorcise Beloved from 124. When they arrive at Sethe’s house, they see Sethe on the porch with Beloved, who stands smiling at them, naked and pregnant. Mr. Bodwin, who has come to 124 to take Denver to her new job, arrives at the house. Mistaking him for schoolteacher, Sethe runs at Mr. Bodwin with an ice pick. She is restrained, but in the confusion Beloved disappears, never to return.
Afterward, Paul D comes back to Sethe, who has retreated to Baby Suggs’s bed to die. Mourning Beloved, Sethe laments, “She was my best thing.” But Paul D replies, “You your best thing, Sethe.” The novel then ends with a warning that “[t]his is not a story to pass on.” The town, and even the residents of 124, have forgotten Beloved “[l]ike an unpleasant dream during a troubling sleep.”"
Journal,"“The Yellow Wallpaper” opens with the story’s unnamed narrator, who expresses her thoughts in the form of journal entries, marveling at the grandeur of the house and grounds her husband has taken her to for the summer. She feels, however, that there is “something queer” about the place and explains that her case of “nervous depression” is what prompted their stay there. The narrator complains that her husband John, who is also her doctor, belittles both her illness and, more generally, her perspective. Her treatment, known as the “rest cure,” requires that she refrain from virtually any form of activity, even working and writing. Despite these instructions, she feels that activity, freedom, and interesting work would help her condition and has begun keeping a secret journal in order to “relieve her mind.” The narrator continues her journal entry by describing the house and gardens, both of which are beautiful yet clearly impacted by the estate’s years of emptiness. In the nursery on the top floor, however, she finds the yellow wallpaper, with its strange, formless pattern, to be particularly disturbing.
As the first few weeks of the summer pass, the narrator succeeds at hiding her journal, thus keeping her true thoughts from John. While she longs for more stimulating company and complains about John’s patronizing, controlling ways, she takes a new interest in the oddly-menacing wallpaper. John worries about her fixation, and he refuses to repaper the room so as not to give in to her nervousness. The narrator’s imagination, however, has awakened, and she reflects on her history of having an overactive mind. She goes on to describe the bedroom again, which she says must have been a nursery for young children due to the fact that the paper is torn off the wall in spots, there are scratches and gouges in the floor, and the furniture is heavy and fixed in place. Just as she begins to see a strange sub-pattern behind the main design of the wallpaper, John’s sister Jennie, who serves as a housekeeper and nurse for the narrator, interrupts her writing. 
As the Fourth of July passes, the narrator reports that her family has just visited, leaving her more tired than ever. John threatens to send her to Weir Mitchell, the real-life physician under whose care author Charlotte Perkins Gilman suffered. The narrator is alone most of the time and says that she has become almost fond of the wallpaper; studying the pattern has become her primary form of entertainment. As her obsession grows, the sub-pattern of the wallpaper becomes clearer. It begins to resemble a woman “stooping down and creeping” behind the main pattern, which at nighttime looks like the bars of a cage. Soon the wallpaper dominates the narrator’s imagination. Mistaking the narrator’s fixation for tranquility, John thinks she is improving. On the contrary, she sleeps less and less and believes that she can smell the paper all over the house. The sub-pattern now clearly resembles a woman who is trying to escape from behind the main pattern. The narrator sees her shaking the bars at night and creeping around during the day, when the woman is able to leave the wall. 
Suspecting that John and Jennie know of her obsession, she resolves to destroy the paper once and for all, peeling much of it off during the night. While left alone the next day, she goes into something of a frenzy, biting and tearing at the paper in order to free the trapped woman whom she sees struggling from inside the pattern. By the end, the narrator is hopelessly insane, convinced that there are many women creeping around and that she herself has come out of the wallpaper. She creeps endlessly around the room, smudging the wallpaper as she goes. When John breaks into the locked room and sees the full horror of the situation, he faints in the doorway so that the narrator has “to creep over him every time!”"
Furtherance,"In the late nineteenth century, a man named Samuel Hamilton settles in the Salinas Valley in northern California. He brings his strict but loving wife, Liza, with him from Ireland. Although Samuel is well respected in the community, he never becomes a wealthy man. The Hamiltons go on to have nine children and become a prominent family in the valley.
Adam Trask, meanwhile, settles in the valley with his pregnant wife Cathy where he eventually becomes friends with Samuel Hamilton. Before moving to California, Adam lives on a farm in Connecticut with his half-brother, Charles. The dark and moody Charles resents the fact that his and Adam’s father, Cyrus, has always favored the good-natured Adam. Upon his death, Cyrus leaves his sons a large and unexpected fortune, probably stolen during his days as an administrator in the U.S. Army. Despite their newfound wealth, Adam and Charles remain unable to get along. Charles is disgusted at his brother’s marriage to Cathy, who, unbeknownst to Adam or Charles, is a former prostitute who murdered her parents and stole their money. Although Charles despises Cathy, he takes her into his bed after she drugs Adam on their wedding night.
Adam and Cathy move to California, as Adam proves unable to live peacefully with Charles in Connecticut. In Salinas, Cathy learns she is pregnant and attempts to abort her baby in order to prevent any furtherance of ties to her husband. She is desperate to escape Adam despite the fact that he loves her and provides for her. The abortion is unsuccessful, and Cathy eventually gives birth to twins, Aron and Caleb (Cal). It is clear from the start, however, that Cathy does not care about the infants and wants to leave the household as soon as possible. One day, Cathy shoots Adam, flees the house, and moves to Salinas proper to resume her life as a prostitute. Adam decides to cover for Cathy by lying to the local sheriff and saying that his gunshot wound was an accident.
Cathy wins the trust of Faye, the madam of a local brothel, then poisons her and fools the doctors and other prostitutes into thinking that Faye died naturally. Cathy assumes control of the brothel and starts to blackmail powerful men in Salinas with photographs of them performing sadomasochistic sex acts with her and her prostitutes. To protect the dazed Adam and his twin boys, neither Samuel Hamilton nor Lee, Adam’s housekeeper, tells Adam or the boys that Cathy works at a brothel.
As the twins grow older, Aron manifests his father’s good heart, whereas Cal exhibits his mother’s ruthlessness and tendency to manipulate. By the time they reach early adolescence, however, Cal actively struggles against his dark side and prays to God to make him more like Aron. Adam, meanwhile, remains melancholy and listless for years after Cathy’s departure. In order to jolt Adam out of his despondency, Samuel finally tells him the truth about Cathy. Samuel dies soon afterward.
After Samuel’s funeral, Adam visits Cathy at the brothel. Her deteriorating body and cynical, vulgar talk make Adam realize that he can now move on and forget her, as she is a repugnant creature who has become irrelevant to his life. Cathy, however, is desperate to retain power over Adam. She even offers to have sex with him to keep him in the brothel and prove that he is no better than she. Adam refuses and leaves with a serene smile.
After his triumph over Cathy, Adam becomes a livelier and more committed father to his boys. Adam decides to move the family off the ranch and into the town of Salinas so that Aron and Cal can attend school. The twins are assigned to the seventh grade, and Aron begins a relationship with Abra, the goodhearted daughter of a corrupt county supervisor. Cal continues to struggle with his dark side, and when he finally happens to discover the truth about his mother, he believes that her evil has been passed down to him. But Adam’s housekeeper, Lee, who has extensively researched the biblical story of Cain and Abel, advises Cal that God intends each individual to choose his own moral destiny rather than be constrained by the legacy of his parents. This idea, encapsulated by the Hebrew word timshel (meaning “thou mayest”), counters Cal’s fatalistic idea that he has inherited his mother’s evil and sin.
Aron gradually withdraws into religious fervor in order to shield himself from the corruption of the world—an approach that Abra and Lee consider cowardly. Adam, meanwhile, squanders the family fortune on a poorly executed business venture involving refrigerated shipping of vegetables. Aron graduates from high school early and leaves for Stanford University. Adam misses Aron terribly, thinking him smarter and more ambitious than Cal.
However, Cal, in collaboration with Will Hamilton, one of Samuel’s sons, works secretly to earn back the fortune his father lost on the failed refrigeration business. Cal also hopes to make enough money to pay for Aron’s tuition at Stanford. In the strained economy of World War I, Will and Cal buy beans from local farmers at an unfairly low price and sell the beans, in turn, to desperate British buyers at an unfairly high price. The venture nets Cal thousands of dollars, which he plans to give to his father as a gift at Thanksgiving.
Aron, who is miserable at Stanford, comes home for Thanksgiving. Adam is thrilled to see Aron but appalled by Cal’s gift of money. Adam considers the money to be earned dishonestly and tells Cal to give it back to the farmers from whom he stole it. Enraged and jealous of Adam’s obvious preference for Aron, Cal loses control of his anger and rashly tells Aron the truth about their mother, Cathy. When Cal takes Aron to the brothel to show him that Cathy is still alive, the revelation crushes the fragile Aron, who screams incoherently and runs away. The next day, the shattered Aron joins the Army, while Cathy, horrified by her son’s reaction to her, commits suicide by overdosing on morphine. She leaves her entire fortune—part of it inherited from Charles, part of it earned through blackmail and prostitution—to Aron.
When Adam discovers that Aron has joined the Army, he lapses into a state of shock. Lee talks to Cal about the idea of timshel and urges Cal to remember that, despite his guilt, he is a normal, flawed human being—not an aberrant embodiment of evil. This discussion makes Cal feel somewhat better, and he is able to begin a relationship with Abra, who is no longer in love with Aron.
A telegram arrives informing the family that Aron has been killed in World War I. Adam has a severe stroke upon hearing the news, and Lee brings Abra and Cal to see Adam on his deathbed. Lee informs Adam that the guilt-stricken Cal told Aron about their mother only because Cal was convinced that their father loved Aron more than him. Lee asks Adam to offer his blessing to Cal before he dies. At this, Adam raises his hand and whispers the single word timshel."
Needed,"Siddhartha, the handsome and respected son of a Brahmin, lives with his father in ancient India. Everyone in the village expects Siddhartha to be a successful Brahmin like his father. Siddhartha enjoys a near-idyllic existence with his best friend, Govinda, but he is secretly dissatisfied. He performs all the rituals of religion, and he does what religion says should bring him happiness and peace. Nonetheless, he feels something is missing. His father and the other elders have still not achieved enlightenment, and he feels that staying with them will not settle the questions he has about the nature of his existence. Siddhartha believes his father has already passed on all the wisdom their community has to offer, but he longs for something more. 
One day, a group of wandering ascetics called Samanas passes through town. They are starved and almost naked and have come to beg for food. They believe enlightenment can be reached through asceticism, a rejection of the body and physical desire. The path the Samanas preach is quite different from the one Siddhartha has been taught, and he believes it may provide some of the answers he is looking for. He decides to follow this new path. Siddhartha’s father does not want him to join the Samanas, but he cannot dissuade Siddhartha. Govinda also wants to find a path to enlightenment, and he joins Siddhartha in this new life.
	Siddhartha adjusts quickly to the ways of the Samanas because of the patience and discipline he learned in the Brahmin tradition. He learns how to free himself from the traditional trappings of life, and so loses his desire for property, clothing, sexuality, and all sustenance except that required to live. His goal is to find enlightenment by eliminating his Self, and he successfully renounces the pleasures of the world. 
Sunburned and half-starved, Siddhartha soon ceases to resemble the boy he used to be. Govinda is quick to praise the Samanas and notes the considerable moral and spiritual improvements they both have achieved since joining. Siddhartha, however, is still dissatisfied. The path of self-denial does not provide a permanent solution for him. He points out that the oldest Samanas have lived the life for many years but have yet to attain true spiritual enlightenment. The Samanas have been as unsuccessful as the Brahmins Siddhartha and Govinda left behind. At this time, Siddhartha and the other Samanas begin to hear about a new holy man named Gotama the Buddha who has attained the total spiritual enlightenment called Nirvana. Govinda convinces Siddhartha they both should leave the Samanas and seek out Gotama. Siddhartha and Govinda inform the leader of the Samanas of their decision to leave. The leader is clearly displeased, but Siddhartha silences him with an almost magical, hypnotizing gaze. 
Siddhartha and Govinda find Gotama’s camp of followers and are taken in. Siddhartha is initially pleased with Gotama, and he and Govinda are instructed in the Eightfold Path, the four main points, and other aspects of Buddhism. However, while Govinda is convinced to join Gotama and his followers, Siddhartha still has doubts. He has noticed a contradiction in Gotama’s teachings: Siddhartha questions how one can embrace the unity of all things, as the Buddha asks, if they are also being told to overcome the physical world. Siddhartha realizes Buddhism will not give him the answers he needs. Sadly, he leaves Govinda behind and begins a search for the meaning of life, the achievement of which he feels will not be dependent on religious instruction. 
	Siddhartha decides to embark on a life free from meditation and the spiritual quests he has been pursuing, and to instead learn from the pleasures of the body and the material world. In his new wanderings, Siddhartha meets a friendly ferryman, fully content with his simple life. Siddhartha crosses the ferryman’s river and comes to a city. Here, a beautiful courtesan named Kamala entrances him. He knows she would be the best one to teach him about the world of love, but Kamala will not have him unless he proves he can fit into the material world. She convinces him to take up the path of the merchant. With her help, Siddhartha soon finds employment with a merchant named Kamaswami and begins to learn the trade. While Siddhartha learns the wisdom of the business world and begins to master the skills Kamaswami teaches him, Kamala becomes his lover and teaches him what she knows about love.
	Years pass, and Siddhartha’s business acumen increases. Soon, he is a rich man and enjoys the benefits of an affluent life. He gambles, drinks, and dances, and anything that can be bought in the material world is his for the taking. Siddhartha is detached from this life, however, and he can never see it as more than a game. He doesn’t care if he wins or loses this game because it doesn’t touch his spirit in any lasting way. The more he obtains in the material world, the less it satisfies him, and he is soon caught in a cycle of unhappiness that he tries to escape by engaging in even more gambling, drinking, and sex. When he is at his most disillusioned, he dreams that Kamala’s rare songbird is dead in its cage. He understands that the material world is slowly killing him without providing him with the enlightenment for which he has been searching. One night, he resolves to leave it all behind and departs without notifying either Kamala or Kamaswami. 
Sick at heart, Siddhartha wanders until he finds a river. He considers drowning himself, but he instead falls asleep on the riverbank. While he is sleeping, Govinda, who is now a Buddhist monk, passes by. Not recognizing Siddhartha, he watches over the sleeping man to protect him from snakes. Siddhartha immediately recognizes Govinda when he wakes up, but Govinda notes that Siddhartha has changed significantly from his days with the Samanas and now appears to be a rich man. Siddhartha responds that he is currently neither a Samana nor a rich man. Siddhartha wishes to become someone new. Govinda soon leaves to continue on his journey, and Siddhartha sits by the river and considers where his life has taken him. 
	Siddhartha seeks out the same content ferryman he met years before. The ferryman, who introduces himself as Vasudeva, radiates an inner peace that Siddhartha wishes to attain. Vasudeva says he himself has attained this sense of peace through many years of studying the river. Siddhartha expresses a desire to likewise learn from the river, and Vasudeva agrees to let Siddhartha live and work beside him. Siddhartha studies the river and begins to take from it a spiritual enlightenment unlike any he has ever known. While sitting by the river, he contemplates the unity of all life, and in the river’s voice he hears the word Om. 

	One day Kamala the courtesan approaches the ferry along with her son on a pilgrimage to visit Gotama, who is said to be dying. Before they can cross, a snake bites Kamala. Siddhartha and Vasudeva tend to Kamala, but the bite kills her. Before she dies, she tells Siddhartha that he is the father of her eleven-year-old son. Siddhartha does his best to console and provide for his son, but the boy is spoiled and cynical. Siddhartha’s son dislikes life with the two ferrymen and wishes to return to his familiar city and wealth. Vasudeva believes Siddhartha’s son should be allowed to leave if he wants to, but Siddhartha is not ready to let him go. One morning, Siddhartha awakens to find his son has run away and stolen all of his and Vasudeva’s money. Siddhartha chases after the boy, but as he reaches the city he realizes the chase is futile. Vasudeva follows Siddhartha and brings him back to their home by the river, instructing him to soothe the pain of losing his son by listening to the river.
	Siddhartha studies the river for many years, and Vasudeva teaches Siddhartha how to learn the many secrets the river has to tell. In contemplating the river, Siddhartha has a revelation: Just as the water of the river flows into the ocean and is returned by rain, all forms of life are interconnected in a cycle without beginning or end. Birth and death are all part of a timeless unity. Life and death, joy and sorrow, good and evil are all parts of the whole and are necessary to understand the meaning of life. By the time Siddhartha has learned all the river’s lessons, Vasudeva announces that he is through with his life at the river. He retires into the forest, leaving Siddhartha to be the ferryman.
	The novel ends with Govinda returning to the river to seek enlightenment by meeting with a wise man who lives there. When Govinda arrives, he does not recognize that the wise man is Siddhartha himself. Govinda is still a follower of Gotama but has yet to attain the kind of enlightenment that Siddhartha now radiates, and he asks Siddhartha to teach him what he knows. Siddhartha explains that neither he nor anyone can teach the wisdom to Govinda, because verbal explanations are limited and can never communicate the entirety of enlightenment. Instead, he asks Govinda to kiss him on the forehead, and when Govinda does, the vision of unity that Siddhartha has experienced is communicated instantly to Govinda. Govinda and Siddhartha have both finally achieved the enlightenment they set out to find in the days of their youth."
Brutus,"The novel begins in prison, with the novel’s protagonist and narrator Oliver Marks handcuffed to a table and talking to Joseph Colborne, the detective who was formerly assigned to his case. Colborne congratulates Oliver on being granted parole after serving a ten-year sentence for the murder of his classmate, Richard Stirling, and asks him to share what actually happened ten years earlier. Oliver agrees and the narrative shifts in time to a period ten years earlier. At the start of each chapter, called “acts” as in a play, the novel returns to the present, where Filippa drives Oliver to Dellecher Classical Conservatory, the prestigious arts school they attended together. Detective Colborne and Oliver walk around the lake, reliving and narrating the events that led to Oliver’s incarceration.
The novel’s main action revolves around  seven fourth-year acting students. Their final year will focus on Shakespeare’s tragedies, and their fall performance is slated to be Julius Caesar. Close friends, they can easily anticipate their roles based on previous castings, even before their auditions: Richard will be Caesar; James will play Brutus; Alexander, Cassius; Oliver will be Octavius; Meredith’s role will be Calpurnia; Wren will play Portia; and Filippa will be in drag, playing multiple male characters. The students are also assigned roles for a Halloween performance of Macbeth. 
In response to pressures of their fourth year, previously close relations between the students quickly devolve. Richard begins abusing his classmates, physically and verbally, during rehearsals for Julius Caesar. His girlfriend, Meredith, and his main competitor, James, are both covered in bruises. Tensions run high as the play is slow to come together and, after the Macbeth performance, a friendly game in the lake turns ugly when Richard holds James under water, nearly drowning him. Meredith breaks up with Richard, and the group decides to teach him a lesson, using a rehearsal to attack their classmate. But despite obstacles, the play finally comes together, and opening night is a success. At the raucous afterparty, Meredith flirts with a cellist and Richard, enraged, attacks him, sending him to the infirmary. Angry, Meredith invites Oliver up to her room, and the two have sex, while an enraged Richard pounds on the door.  
A few hours later, Filippa summons Meredith and Oliver to the lake. There Oliver and Meredith discover a battered, broken and seemingly deceased Richard floating in the water. Richard emits a gurgling sound indicating he’s still alive. Frightened and exhausted of Richard’s abuse, the six collectively decide to let him die in the water, assuming that he injured himself while intoxicated. They craft a narrative of likely events for school administration and the police and feel relief when everyone seems to accept their version of events. But guilt erodes their relations with each other and impacts their behavior. Meredith and Oliver continue dating but struggle to be comfortable together under the watchful eye of Richard’s specter. Alexander indulges even more freely in drugs and alcohol. Wren withdraws into herself while James’s behavior becomes erratic. The only character who seems able to hold things together is Filippa. The Thanksgiving holiday offers little respite from their stress. When Oliver’s holiday plans to visit Meredith in New York are derailed by an unexpected visit from James, Meredith is upset that Oliver chooses James over her, a frequent point of contention. 
The Christmas holidays prove equally tense. Oliver learns that his family cannot afford for him to return to Dellecher and, after fighting with them, flees to New York, spending the break in Meredith’s family apartment. Oliver arranges for financial aid to complete his final year, agreeing to be the custodian for the Dellecher Castle, where the acting students live. The play for the spring is King Lear and, unlike the fall, the casting comes as a surprise. James is assigned the role of Edmund, the play’s main antagonist, while Oliver, usually cast as James’s sidekick, is given the part of Edgar. The two friends are now opponents. Not only do the teachers, Frederick and Camilo, take roles to fill out the mature cast, but James and Meredith also have romantic scenes, a challenge given their mutual dislike. The students will also perform Romeo and Juliet as a masque. 
When the police return and Alexander overdoses, Oliver realizes the group is beginning to crack under the strain of allowing Richard to die. While cleaning the fireplace, Oliver finds a bloody piece of cloth, clearly from Richard’s shirt, and realizes that his death was not the accident they believed it to be. Oliver hides the fabric but feels mounting anxiety. At the same time, rehearsals for King Lear add drama to the students’ lives. Prompted by Gwendolyn, who deplores their lack of connection, James and Meredith kiss passionately. Watching, Oliver realizes he is jealous and comes to understand that he has feelings for James. During another rehearsal, this time for a fight scene, James attacks Oliver, breaking his nose. They limp through the Romeo and Juliet performance, their relationships fragile and tense, although King Lear proves their final undoing. 
The day of the performance, while cleaning, Oliver finds a bloody boat hook hidden in James’s mattress and realizes that he must have used it to hit Richard. Oliver confronts James, who admits that he did hit Richard with it after Richard bullied him and accused him of being in love with Oliver. James also explains that Filippa has known the truth all along and helped him hide the crime. Despite these revelations, Oliver and James manage somehow to finish the play. The detectives and school administration wait in the wings. After the play, Oliver confesses to the crime James committed. Though Detective Colborne is suspicious of his confession, Oliver doesn’t recant it, and after a brief trial, Oliver is charged with second-degree murder. Oliver’s story finished, the novel ends in the present. Colborne wishes him well, and Filippa, who has visited Oliver every two weeks during his time in prison, informs him that James committed suicide years ago. Oliver goes to New York to see Meredith, now a famous actress, and the two resume a relationship. Filippa sends Oliver a note James had left for him, which is a passage from Pericles, Prince of Tyre. The passage is obscure but leaves open the possibility that James, whose body was never found, may still be alive."
Her,"Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert are unmarried siblings who live on their ancestral farm, Green Gables, in the quiet town of Avonlea in Prince Edward Island, Canada. Matthew is sixty, and since he is getting too old to handle the farm work on his own, the Cuthberts decide to adopt an orphan boy to help him. This decision shocks the town gossip, Mrs. Rachel Lynde, who does not think Matthew and Marilla fit to raise a child.
	Matthew, who is terrified of women, arrives at the train station and finds a girl orphan instead of a boy; the orphanage sent the eleven-year-old Anne Shirley by mistake. Anne’s talkativeness and spirit charm Matthew, who shyly tells Marilla that he wants to keep her. Marilla hesitates at first, but after a trial period, she agrees to let Anne stay on.
	Anne is a talkative and happy girl despite living an impoverished life as an orphan. Though she lacks social graces and education, she has a rich and sophisticated fantasy life and an optimistic and generous spirit. Because Anne acts according to her instincts and not according to a code of manners, she unintentionally defies expectations of proper ladylike behavior. She attends church for the first time wearing a wreath of wildflowers, for example, and screams at Mrs. Rachel for making fun of her red hair. Anne tries hard to oblige Marilla and follow her rules of social conduct, but she makes many mistakes, using liniment instead of vanilla in a cake, letting a mouse drown in the plum-pudding sauce, and delivering a heartfelt but ridiculous prayer on her first attempt to pray before bed.
	Anne never had real friends before living at Green Gables, so she was forced to invent imaginary playmates. In Avonlea, she meets Diana Barry, a neighbor who quickly becomes her bosom friend. One afternoon Anne invites Diana to tea and accidentally gives her red currant wine instead of nonalcoholic raspberry cordial. Diana returns home drunk, and Diana’s mother, thinking Anne has intoxicated Diana on purpose, forbids the girls to speak. The agonizing period of estrangement lasts until Anne saves Diana’s sister, who is sick with the croup, which causes Mrs. Barry to forgive her.
	At school, Anne feuds with a handsome, smart boy named Gilbert Blythe. When they first meet, Gilbert taunts Anne by calling her Carrots and pulling her red braid. Anne is extremely sensitive about her red hair, and Gilbert’s teasing infuriates her. She screams at him and smashes a slate over his head. This incident marks the beginning of a rivalry between Anne and Gilbert, the two smartest pupils, which lasts until the end of the novel.
	As Anne grows up, she loses some of her childish flare for the melodramatic and romantic, and turns her spirited attentions to academics. A beloved teacher, Miss Stacy, recognizes Anne’s intelligence and encourages her to join a special group of students preparing for the entrance exam to Queen’s Academy. Her long-standing competition with Gilbert Blythe changes to an affectionate and familiar rivalry when, after four years of mutual silence, they both go to Queen’s Academy. Striving to make Matthew and Marilla proud, Anne devotes herself to her studies wholeheartedly and earns the prestigious Avery Scholarship, which grants her enough money to attend a four-year college the following fall.
	Thrilled by her future prospects, Anne goes home to Green Gables. Matthew, who has been having heart trouble, dies of a heart attack. When Anne learns that Marilla is likely to go blind, she decides to stay at Green Gables and teach nearby so that she can care for Marilla, giving up her aspirations for a four-year degree. Gilbert hears of her decision and gives up his post as the teacher at Avonlea school so that Anne can teach there and be closer to Marilla. After five years of rivalry, Gilbert and Anne forge a close friendship. Though her future path has narrowed considerably, Anne remains eternally optimistic and thinks cheerfully about her future."
North,"The protagonist, who is named Tim O’Brien, begins by describing an event that occurred in the middle of his Vietnam experience. “The Things They Carried” catalogs the variety of things his fellow soldiers in the Alpha Company brought on their missions. Several of these things are intangible, including guilt and fear, while others are specific physical objects, including matches, morphine, M-16 rifles, and M&M’s candy.
Throughout the collection, the same characters reappear in various stories. The first member of the Alpha Company to die is Ted Lavender, a “grunt,” or low-ranking soldier, who deals with his anxiety about the war by taking tranquilizers and smoking marijuana. Lavender is shot in the head on his way back from going to the bathroom, and his superior, Lieutenant Jimmy Cross, blames himself for the tragedy. When Lavender is shot, Cross is distracting himself with thoughts of Martha, a college crush. It is revealed in “Love” that Cross’s feelings for Martha, whom he dated once before leaving for Vietnam, were never reciprocated, and that even twenty years after the war, his guilt over Lavender’s death remains.
In “On the Rainy River,” the narrator, O’Brien, explains the series of events that led him to Vietnam in the first place. He receives his draft notice in June of 1968, and his feelings of confusion drive him north to the Canadian border, which he contemplates crossing so that he will not be forced to fight in a war in which he doesn’t believe. Sitting in a rowboat with the proprietor of the Tip Top Lodge, where he stays, O’Brien decides that his guilt about avoiding the war and fear of disappointing his family are more important than his political convictions. He soon leaves, going first back home to Worthington, Minnesota and later to Vietnam.
In addition to Ted Lavender, a few other members of the Alpha Company are killed during their mission overseas, including Curt Lemon, who is killed when he steps on a rigged mortar round. Though O’Brien is not close to Lemon, in “The Dentist,” he tells a story of how Lemon, who faints before a routine checkup with an army-issued dentist, tries to save face by insisting that a perfectly good tooth be pulled. Lee Strunk, another member of the company, dies from injuries he sustains by stepping on a landmine. In “Friends,” O’Brien remembers that before Strunk was fatally hurt, Strunk and Dave Jensen had made a pact that if either man were irreparably harmed, the other man would see that he was quickly killed. However, when Strunk is actually hurt, he begs Jensen to spare him, and Jensen complies. Instead of being upset by the news of his friend’s swift death en route to treatment, Jensen is relieved.
The death that receives the most attention in The Things They Carried is that of Kiowa, a much-loved member of the Alpha Company and one of O’Brien’s closest friends. In “Speaking of Courage,” the story of Kiowa’s death is relayed in retrospect through the memory of Norman Bowker, years after the war. As Bowker drives around a lake in his Iowa hometown, he thinks that he failed to save Kiowa, who was killed when a mortar round hit and caused him to sink headfirst into a marshy field. O’Brien realizes that he has dealt with his guilt over Kiowa’s death differently than Norman Bowker in “Notes.” Just before the end of the war, O’Brien receives a long letter from Bowker that says he hasn’t found a way to make life meaningful after the war. O’Brien resolves to tell Bowker’s story, and the story of Kiowa’s death, in order to negotiate his own feelings of guilt and hollowness.
Like “Love” and “Notes,” several of O’Brien’s stories are told from a perspective twenty years after the Vietnam War, when he is a forty-three-year-old writer living in Massachusetts. Exposure to the guilt of old friends like Jimmy Cross and Norman Bowker prompts him to write stories in order to understand what they were going through. But two stories, “The Man I Killed” and “Ambush,” are written so that O’Brien can confront his own guilt over killing a man with a grenade outside the village of My Khe. In “The Man I Killed,” O’Brien imagines the life of his victim, from his childhood to the way things would have turned out for him had O’Brien not spotted him on a path and thrown a grenade at his feet. In “Ambush,” O’Brien imagines how he might relay the story of the man he killed to his nine-year-old daughter, Kathleen. In this second story, O’Brien provides more details of the actual killing—including the sound of the grenade and his own feelings—and explains that even well after the fact, he hasn’t finished sorting out the experience.
In the last story, “The Lives of the Dead,” O’Brien gives another twist to his contention that stories have the power to save people. In the stories of Curt Lemon and Kiowa, O’Brien explains that his imagination allowed him to grapple successfully with his guilt and confusion over the death of his fourth-grade first love, Linda."
Vows,"Scout Finch lives with her brother, Jem, and their widowed father, Atticus, in the sleepy Alabama town of Maycomb. Maycomb is suffering through the Great Depression, but Atticus is a prominent lawyer and the Finch family is reasonably well off in comparison to the rest of society. One summer, Jem and Scout befriend a boy named Dill, who has come to live in their neighborhood for the summer, and the trio acts out stories together. Eventually, Dill becomes fascinated with the spooky house on their street called the Radley Place. The house is owned by Mr. Nathan Radley, whose brother, Arthur (nicknamed Boo), has lived there for years without venturing outside.
Scout goes to school for the first time that fall and detests it. She and Jem find gifts apparently left for them in a knothole of a tree on the Radley property. Dill returns the following summer, and he, Scout, and Jem begin to act out the story of Boo Radley. Atticus puts a stop to their antics, urging the children to try to see life from another person’s perspective before making judgments. But, on Dill’s last night in Maycomb for the summer, the three sneak onto the Radley property, where Nathan Radley shoots at them. Jem loses his pants in the ensuing escape. When he returns for them, he finds them mended and hung over the fence.
The next winter, Jem and Scout find more presents in the tree, presumably left by the mysterious Boo. Nathan Radley eventually plugs the knothole with cement. Shortly thereafter, a fire breaks out in another neighbor’s house, and during the fire someone slips a blanket on Scout’s shoulders as she watches the blaze. Convinced that Boo did it, Jem tells Atticus about the mended pants and the presents.
To the consternation of Maycomb’s racist white community, Atticus agrees to defend a Black man named Tom Robinson, who has been accused of raping a white woman. Because of Atticus’s decision, Jem and Scout are subjected to abuse from other children, even when they celebrate Christmas at the family compound on Finch’s Landing. Calpurnia, the Finches’ Black cook, takes them to the local Black church, where the warm and close-knit community largely embraces the children.
Atticus’s sister, Alexandra, comes to live with the Finches the next summer. Dill, who is supposed to live with his “new father” in another town, runs away and comes to Maycomb. Tom Robinson’s trial begins, and when the accused man is placed in the local jail, a mob gathers to lynch him. Atticus faces the mob down the night before the trial. Jem and Scout, who have sneaked out of the house, soon join him. Scout recognizes one of the men, and her polite questioning about his son shames him into dispersing the mob.
At the trial itself, the children sit in the “colored balcony” with the town’s Black citizens. Atticus provides clear evidence that the accusers, Mayella Ewell and her father, Bob, are lying: in fact, Mayella propositioned Tom Robinson, was caught by her father, and then accused Tom of rape to cover her shame and guilt. Atticus provides impressive evidence that the marks on Mayella’s face are from wounds that her father inflicted; upon discovering her with Tom, he called her a whore and beat her. Yet, despite the significant evidence pointing to Tom’s innocence, the all-white jury convicts him. The innocent Tom later tries to escape from prison and is shot to death. In the aftermath of the trial, Jem’s faith in justice is badly shaken, and he lapses into despondency and doubt.
Despite the verdict, Bob Ewell feels that Atticus and the judge have made a fool out of him, and he vows revenge. He menaces Tom Robinson’s widow, tries to break into the judge’s house, and finally attacks Jem and Scout as they walk home from a Halloween party. Boo Radley intervenes, however, saving the children and stabbing Ewell fatally during the struggle. Boo carries the wounded Jem back to Atticus’s house, where the sheriff, in order to protect Boo, insists that Ewell tripped over a tree root and fell on his own knife. After sitting with Scout for a while, Boo disappears once more into the Radley house.  
Later, Scout feels as though she can finally imagine what life is like for Boo. He has become a human being to her at last. With this realization, Scout embraces her father’s advice to practice sympathy and understanding and demonstrates that her experiences with hatred and prejudice will not sully her faith in human goodness."
Faithful,"The narrator defends the story he is about to tell, which is framed as a dream. He explains that he fell asleep in the wilderness and dreamed of a man named Christian, who was tormented by spiritual anguish. A spiritual guide named Evangelist visits Christian and urges him to leave the City of Destruction. Evangelist claims that salvation can only be found in the Celestial City, known as Mount Zion.
Christian begs his family to accompany him, unsuccessfully. On his way, Christian falls into a bog called the Slough of Despond, but he is saved. He meets Worldly Wiseman, who urges him to lead a practical, happy existence without religion. Refusing, Christian is sheltered in Goodwill’s house. Goodwill tells Christian to stop by the Interpreter’s home, where Christian learns many lessons about faith.
Walking along the wall of Salvation, Christian sees Christ’s tomb and cross. At this vision, his burden falls to the ground. One of the three Shining Ones, celestial creatures, hands him a rolled certificate for entry to the Celestial City. Christian falls asleep and loses his certificate. Since the certificate is his ticket into the Celestial City, Christian reproaches himself for losing it. After retracing his tracks, he eventually finds the certificate. Walking on, Christian meets the four mistresses of the Palace Beautiful, who provide him shelter. They also feed him and arm him. After descending the Valley of Humiliation, Christian meets the monster Apollyon, who tries to kill him. Christian is armed, and he strikes Apollyon with a sword and then proceeds through the desert-like Valley of the Shadow of Death toward the Celestial City.
Christian meets Faithful, a traveler from his hometown. Faithful and Christian are joined by a third pilgrim, Talkative, whom Christian spurns. Evangelist arrives and warns Faithful and Christian about the wicked town of Vanity, which they will soon enter. Evangelist foretells that either Christian or Faithful will die in Vanity.
The two enter Vanity and visit its famous fair. They resist temptation and are mocked by the townspeople. Eventually the citizens of Vanity imprison Christian and Faithful for mocking their local religion. Faithful defends himself at his trial and is executed, rising to heaven after death. Christian is remanded to prison but later escapes and continues his journey.
Another fellow pilgrim named Hopeful befriends Christian on his way. On their journey, a pilgrim who uses religion as a means to get ahead in the world, named By-ends, crosses their path. Christian rejects his company. The two enter the plain of Ease, where a smooth talker named Demas tempts them with silver. Christian and Hopeful pass him by.
Taking shelter for the night on the grounds of Doubting Castle, they awake to the threats of the castle’s owner, the Giant Despair, who, with the encouragement of his wife, imprisons and tortures them. Christian and Hopeful escape when they remember they possess the key of Promise, which unlocks any door in Despair’s domain.
Proceeding onward, Christian and Hopeful approach the Delectable Mountains near the Celestial City. They encounter wise shepherds who warn them of the treacherous mountains Error and Caution, where previous pilgrims have died. The shepherds point out travelers who wander among tombs nearby, having been blinded by the Giant Despair. They warn the travelers to beware of shortcuts, which may be paths to hell.
The two pilgrims meet Ignorance, a sprightly teenager who believes that living a good life is sufficient to prove one’s religious faith. Christian refutes him, and Ignorance decides to avoid their company. The travelers also meet Flatterer, who snares them in a net, and Atheist, who denies that the Celestial City exists. Crossing the sleep-inducing Enchanted Ground, they try to stay awake by discussing Hopeful’s sinful past and religious doctrine.
Christian and Hopeful gleefully approach the land of Beulah, where the Celestial City is located. The landscape teems with flowers and fruit, and the travelers are refreshed. To reach the gate into the city, they must first cross a river without a bridge. Christian nearly drowns, but Hopeful reminds him of Christ’s love, and Christian emerges safely from the water. The residents of the Celestial City joyously welcome the two pilgrims. In his conclusion to Part I, the narrator expresses hope that his dream be interpreted properly.
In the Introduction to Part II, Bunyan addresses the book as “Christiana,” which is the name of Christian’s wife. This part of The Pilgrim’s Progress tells the story of Christiana and her children’s journey to the Celestial City. The narrator recounts having met an old man, Sagacity, who tells the beginning of Christiana’s story. She decides to pack up and follow Christian to the Celestial City, taking her four sons and a fellow townswoman named Mercy along as a servant. On the way, they cross the Slough of Despond but are blocked at the gate by an angry dog. The gatekeeper lets them through. Continuing on, the sons steal fruit from the devil’s garden, and two ruffians threaten to rape the women, but they escape.
The pilgrims are lodged in the Interpreter’s house. The Interpreter orders his manservant Great-heart to accompany them to the House Beautiful. Mr. Brisk pays court to Mercy but soon stops courting her because of her involvement in charity work. As a result of eating the devil’s fruit, Matthew falls ill but is cured by Dr. Skill. The pilgrims descend into the Valley of Humiliation and cross the Valley of the Shadow of Death. They encounter the giant Maul and slay him. After meeting the old pilgrim Honest, they take shelter with Gaius. The pilgrims continue on their journey and kill the Giant Good-slay then rescue the pilgrims Feeble-mind and Ready-to-Halt. They lodge with Mnason. Crossing the river of life, they kill the Giant Despair and greet the kind shepherds who welcome them into the Delectable Mountains.
Christiana meets the great fighter Valiant-for-truth, who accompanies them. They cross the Enchanted Ground and meet the pilgrim Standfast, who has just spurned Madam Bubble, a beautiful temptress. The pilgrims are welcomed in the Celestial City. Christiana goes to meet her maker, the Master. The other pilgrims soon follow."
Limb,"Mary Maloney is a homemaker sitting alone and working on her sewing in her quiet, orderly house as she waits for her husband Patrick, a police detective, to come home from work. Mary is six months pregnant. It is Thursday evening, the night of the couple typically goes out to eat, and Mary has the set-up for pre-dinner cocktails already prepared.
When her husband arrives, Mary greets him warmly. But her repeated offers of affectionate attention are all rebuked by clipped and dispassionate responses from Patrick. She prepares a weak cocktail for herself and a stronger one for Patrick who, uncharacteristically, downs the drink quickly, then pours and consumes a more potent second drink. Quietly alarmed, Mary suggests that Patrick eat some crackers and cheese, which he refuses. Mary then offers to forego their date night and prepare a home-cooked supper, suggesting, perhaps, some lamb chops or pork from the freezer downstairs. Patrick ignores the offer and orders Mary to sit down; he has something to tell her. At this point, her alarm turns to fear.
Patrick attempts to prepare Mary for some shocking news, claiming he has thought about it a lot and that he thinks it best to simply blurt it all out. Though his confession is not specified in the narrative, it becomes clear that Patrick intends to leave Mary. Patrick admits he knows his confession comes at a bad time, presumably, though he doesn’t say so directly, because Mary is pregnant. He tells her he will continue to provide her with financial support, and that he hopes everything will be handled discreetly because otherwise it would be bad for his job.
At first, Mary is stunned and uncertain. She decides that if she behaves as if nothing has happened, she can perhaps undo the damage. Without any direct verbal response to what he has said, she tells Patrick that she is going downstairs to get the meat for dinner, and he does not deter her. Hollowed and stupefied, Mary descends the steps to the cellar, retrieves a leg of lamb from the freezer, and carries it upstairs to prepare a meal. She sees Patrick standing near the window with his back to her. Without turning around, Patrick tells Mary that it is ludicrous to make dinner for him because he is going out.
Upon hearing these words, Mary walks up behind Patrick and brings the frozen leg of lamb down on his head in one unmitigated blow. His body undulates as if in slow motion, then drops dead to the floor, overturning a small table.
In the minutes after the killing, Mary gradually returns to full lucidity. She contemplates with neither concern nor regret, only resignation, that she may be executed for what she has done. It occurs to her to wonder what may happen to the unborn child of a pregnant murderer, and she immediately resolves to be proactive about her situation. She carries the meat into the kitchen, turns on the oven, and places the leg of lamb inside. Mary then practices her smile and tone of voice. It becomes clear that she is rehearsing to purchase potatoes and peas from a grocer named Sam.
Mary hurries out onto the street and goes to the grocery store where she addresses Sam, using the exact dialogue she rehearsed earlier. Sam is clearly familiar with Mr. and Mrs. Maloney, so Mary refers to her husband by his first name and tells Sam that Patrick has decided he is too tired to go out to eat tonight. Sam is attentive, and the two confirm that Mary has already started cooking a frozen leg of lamb.
As she returns home, Mary mentally prepares herself for the cover-up she must create in order to deflect suspicion and make Patrick’s death appear to be the result of an encounter with an unknown murderer. She goes so far as to call out to Patrick as if he could answer her, and the “discovery” of his body causes Mary to experience real, cathartic emotion that plays naturally into her overall charade.
Mary then proceeds to phone the police station where Patrick works, reporting in a heightened state of urgency that she thinks her husband is dead. The police officers who quickly arrive at her house are Sergeant Jack Noonan, whom Mary knows well, and another named O’Malley. Noonan is kind and chivalrous to Mary, as are all the investigators who show up including a doctor, two detectives, a police photographer, a fingerprint expert, and a few others. They sweep through and around the house, asking Mary questions and inspecting the crime scene. Two attendants arrive and remove the corpse. As the minutes pass, Mary picks up on every subtlety of the procedures. She takes in snatches of hushed conversation regarding the investigation, including notations from a brief interview with Sam, the grocer.
Eventually, Noonan suggests Mary find a place to stay and offers to let Mary stay in his own home with him and his wife. Mary rejects the offer, saying that she is too emotionally spent to move from her chair. The number of investigators begins to dwindle, but the process continues around her as Noonan explains that the focus is now on finding the murder weapon. The police believe it must be a large, heavy metal object that is likely still somewhere on the premises.
Mary suggests that a few sips of whiskey might have restorative powers for her. As Noonan accommodates her request, she proposes that perhaps he and the few remaining investigators might also be restored by a small drink. Hesitantly, each of the men accepts. Noonan points out that the leg of lamb is still cooking and offers to turn off the oven. Grateful, Mary expresses to Noonan that the investigative team must be hungry by now, and that the departed Patrick would want her to be hospitable to his colleagues. They would be doing her a great favor if they would dine on the now fully cooked lamb, which she can no longer bring herself to eat.
Though reluctant to accept at first, the team is genuinely hungry and they ultimately acquiesce. While seated around the kitchen table, they engage in a hearty discussion about how the doctor’s report on the deathblow indicates that the murder weapon must have been heavy, too awkward to be easily removed, and is probably somewhere nearby. Oblivious, they eat the leg of lamb while they talk, unaware that the murder weapon is indeed right under their noses.
Mary, still seated in the living room, listens and giggles quietly to herself."
Goal,"Lawyer Bryan Stevenson gives a first-person account of his decades helping marginalized Americans who have been unfairly and harshly punished by the U.S. criminal justice system, which disproportionately targets people of color and poor people. At the heart of Just Mercy is the story of Walter McMillian, a Black man who was framed for the murder of a girl named Ronda Morrison, convicted, and sent to death row. 
Stevenson alternates chapters about Walter with his personal reflections on our country’s history with racial disparity and issues around incarceration. Stevenson highlights other groups of vulnerable people who have been victimized by the criminal justice system and shares the stories of the prisoners he has helped over the years. The book also follows the growth of Stevenson’s nonprofit law project, the Alabama-based Equal Justice Initiative (EJI), through its expansion from focusing on death row prisoners to helping people sentenced to life without parole. Stevenson chronicles how EJI becomes a significant force in criminal justice reform.
In 1983 as a law student, Stevenson discovers his life’s passion when he interns with the Georgia-based Southern Prisoners Defense Committee and meets his first death row prisoner. After graduation Stevenson accepts a job with the organization to represent poor prisoners, including those in Alabama who lack any public defender. He meets Walter McMillian on Alabama’s death row. Walter owns a successful business but also transgresses racial boundaries when he has an affair with a white woman. Soon after the affair becomes public, the woman’s friend, Ralph Myers, accuses Walter of committing the unsolved murder of Ronda Morrison, which has outraged the community. Law enforcement, including a racist sheriff and the district attorney, eagerly pounces on this accusation, overlooking Walter’s alibi and a lack of evidence. Instead, they actively force Ralph to stick with his story even when he tries to recant. They coerce other false witness testimonies, and—as revealed years later—actively suppress evidence.
After Stevenson and the team at EJI unsuccessfully appeal Walter’s conviction, they launch their own investigation of the crime and uncover new evidence. They find witnesses who can prove the witnesses against Walter lied as well as financial records that indicate that one of these witnesses was paid to give false testimony. Stevenson and his team also petition for and receive all records from Walter’s trial. However, their big break comes when they receive a phone call from Ralph, who now wants to make amends. Ralph admits to lying about Walter and says he was threatened by law enforcement. Stevenson wins a hearing for Walter where he can present his new evidence: Ralph’s testimony, which is confirmed by health care workers and other inmates, as well as recordings of the law enforcement team threatening Ralph if he doesn’t frame Walter. 
While the judge refuses to grant Walter relief, Stevenson continues the appeal process through the Alabama courts. The district attorney asks outside agents to investigate the murder for which Walter was convicted, and the investigators determine that Walter had nothing to do with the crime. Six weeks later, the court invalidates Walter’s conviction. Stevenson and the State file a joint motion to dismiss the charges, and Walter is set free.
Throughout the process, Stevenson and Walter become close friends, and Stevenson helps Walter upon his release, including filing a civil suit on his behalf and offering him a place to stay. Walter works with Stevenson to share his story, giving interviews and speaking at legal conferences, and Walter is even featured in a documentary. Unfortunately, Walter is diagnosed with advancing dementia and is forced to rely on family and eventually a nursing facility for his care. He dies in 2013. Stevenson gives a eulogy at his funeral and shares all he learned from Walter, particularly that we must extend mercy to everyone, even those who have not earned it.
Interspersed with chapters chronicling Walter’s narrative are stories of Stevenson’s other clients and work. His closeness with these prisoners and their horrifying circumstances makes Stevenson more determined to help and causes him to reflect on abstract issues that nevertheless imbue the criminal justice system, like humanity and mercy. Stevenson focuses on several categories of vulnerable people who become trapped in the system, including mentally ill prisoners, disabled prisoners, and poor women who give birth to stillborn babies. 
Stevenson and his team at EJI also become increasingly focused on juvenile offenders who are sometimes tried as adults despite their young age. These offenders may be given de facto death sentences by being sentenced to life without parole and face perilous circumstances when they are housed in adult prisons. Stevenson illustrates how these prisoners retain their own humanity while being forced to live under inhumane conditions. He also discusses some of the qualities common among these types of prisoners: They are generally poor and disproportionately people of color, and most of them lack adequate legal counsel. The juveniles have horrific backgrounds of abuse and neglect.
Stevenson and his team at EJI also work to change the legal system to offer more protection to marginalized people. Several of his cases end up before the U.S. Supreme Court, and he succeeds in winning rulings that ban as unconstitutional the conviction of children to life without parole and the execution of people deemed incompetent from dementia or neurological disease. EJI works to raise public awareness of issues surrounding unfair incarceration, produces groundbreaking reports on racial issues, and sets up programs to help formerly incarcerated people adjust to life on the outside.
Stevenson also reflects on the issues that surround the criminal justice system. His time spent with prisoners awaiting their execution makes him realize how inhumane it is to prepare another human to die. After decades of work, when Stevenson fails to prevent the execution of a man who suffers from an intellectual disability, he momentarily feels unable to continue his work. However, he realizes that he cannot help but be broken by his experiences and comes to understand that it is his own brokenness that allows him to more fully understand the need for mercy and to bring compassion to others. The book ends with Stevenson’s renewed commitment to helping others."
Facile,"The convict Jean Valjean is released from a French prison after serving nineteen years for stealing a loaf of bread and for subsequent attempts to escape from prison. When Valjean arrives at the town of Digne, no one is willing to give him shelter because he is an ex-convict. Desperate, Valjean knocks on the door of M. Myriel, the kindly bishop of Digne. Myriel treats Valjean with kindness, and Valjean repays the bishop by stealing his silverware. When the police arrest Valjean, Myriel covers for him, claiming that the silverware was a gift. The authorities release Valjean and Myriel makes him promise to become an honest man. Eager to fulfill his promise, Valjean masks his identity and enters the town of Montreuil-sur-mer. Under the assumed name of Madeleine, Valjean invents an ingenious manufacturing process that brings the town prosperity. He eventually becomes the town’s mayor.
Fantine, a young woman from Montreuil, lives in Paris. She falls in love with Tholomyès, a wealthy student who gets her pregnant and then abandons her. Fantine returns to her home village with her daughter, Cosette. On the way to Montreuil, however, Fantine realizes that she will never be able to find work if the townspeople know that she has an illegitimate child. In the town of Montfermeil, she meets the Thénardiers, a family that runs the local inn. The Thénardiers agree to look after Cosette as long as Fantine sends them a monthly allowance.
In Montreuil, Fantine finds work in Madeleine’s factory. Fantine’s coworkers find out about Cosette, however, and Fantine is fired. The Thénardiers demand more money to support Cosette, and Fantine resorts to prostitution to make ends meet. One night, Javert, Montreuil’s police chief, arrests Fantine. She is to be sent to prison, but Madeleine intervenes. Fantine has fallen ill, and when she longs to see Cosette, Madeleine promises to send for her. First, however, he must contend with Javert, who has discovered Madeleine’s criminal past. Javert tells Madeleine that a man has been accused of being Jean Valjean, and Madeleine confesses his true identity. Javert shows up to arrest Valjean while Valjean is at Fantine’s bedside, and Fantine dies from the shock.
After a few years, Valjean escapes from prison and heads to Montfermeil, where he is able to buy Cosette from the Thénardiers. The Thénardiers turn out to be a family of scoundrels who abuse Cosette while spoiling their own two daughters, Eponine and Azelma. Valjean and Cosette move to a run-down part of Paris. Javert discovers their hideout, however, and they are forced to flee. They find refuge in a convent, where Cosette attends school and Valjean works as a gardener.
Marius Pontmercy is a young man who lives with his wealthy grandfather, M. Gillenormand. Because of political differences within the family, Marius has never met his father, Georges Pontmercy. After his father dies, however, Marius learns more about him and comes to admire his father’s democratic politics. Angry with his grandfather, Marius moves out of Gillenormand’s house and lives as a poor young law student. While in law school, Marius associates with a group of radical students, the Friends of the ABC, who are led by the charismatic Enjolras. One day, Marius sees Cosette at a public park. It is love at first sight, but the protective Valjean does his utmost to prevent Cosette and Marius from ever meeting. Their paths cross once again, however, when Valjean makes a charitable visit to Marius’s poor neighbors, the Jondrettes. The Jondrettes are in fact the Thénardiers, who have lost their inn and moved to Paris under an assumed name. After Valjean leaves, Thénardier announces a plan to rob Valjean when he returns. Alarmed, Marius alerts the local police inspector, who turns out to be Javert. The ambush is foiled and the Thénardiers are arrested, but Valjean escapes before Javert can identify him.
Thénardier’s daughter Eponine, who is in love with Marius, helps Marius discover Cosette’s whereabouts. Marius is finally able to make contact with Cosette, and the two declare their love for each other. Valjean, however, soon shatters their happiness. Worried that he will lose Cosette and unnerved by political unrest in the city, Valjean announces that he and Cosette are moving to England. In desperation, Marius runs to his grandfather, M. Gillenormand, to ask for M. Gillenormand’s permission to marry Cosette. Their meeting ends in a bitter argument. When Marius returns to Cosette, she and Valjean have disappeared. Heartbroken, Marius decides to join his radical student friends, who have started a political uprising. Armed with two pistols, Marius heads for the barricades.
The uprising seems doomed, but Marius and his fellow students nonetheless stand their ground and vow to fight for freedom and democracy. The students discover Javert among their ranks, and, realizing that he is a spy, Enjolras ties him up. As the army launches its first attack against the students, Eponine throws herself in front of a rifle to save Marius’s life. As Eponine dies in Marius’s arms, she hands him a letter from Cosette. Marius quickly scribbles a reply and orders a boy, Gavroche, to deliver it to Cosette.
Valjean manages to intercept the note and sets out to save the life of the man his daughter loves. Valjean arrives at the barricade and volunteers to execute Javert. When alone with Javert, however, Valjean instead secretly lets him go free. As the army storms the barricade, Valjean grabs the wounded Marius and flees through the sewers. When Valjean emerges hours later, Javert immediately arrests him. Valjean pleads with Javert to let him take the dying Marius to Marius’s grandfather. Javert agrees. Javert feels tormented, torn between his duty to his profession and the debt he owes Valjean for saving his life. Ultimately, Javert lets Valjean go and throws himself into the river, where he drowns.
Marius makes a full recovery and is reconciled with Gillenormand, who consents to Marius and Cosette’s marriage. Their wedding is a happy one, marred only when Valjean confesses his criminal past to Marius. Alarmed by this revelation and unaware that it was Valjean who saved his life at the barricades, Marius tries to prevent Cosette from having contact with Valjean. Lonely and depressed, Valjean takes to his bed and awaits his death. Marius eventually finds out from Thénardier that Valjean saved Marius’s life. Ashamed that he mistrusted Valjean, Marius tells Cosette everything that has happened. Marius and Cosette rush to Valjean’s side just in time for a final reconciliation. Happy to be reunited with his adopted daughter, Valjean dies in peace."
Bountiful,"In the remote village of Ndotsheni, in the Natal province of eastern South Africa, the Reverend Stephen Kumalo receives a letter from a fellow minister summoning him to Johannesburg, a city in South Africa. He is needed there, the letter says, to help his sister, Gertrude, who the letter says has fallen ill. Kumalo undertakes the difficult and expensive journey to the city in the hopes of aiding Gertrude and of finding his son, Absalom, who traveled to Johannesburg from Ndotsheni and never returned. In Johannesburg, Kumalo is warmly welcomed by Msimangu, the priest who sent him the letter, and given comfortable lodging by Mrs. Lithebe, a Christian woman who feels that helping others is her duty. Kumalo visits Gertrude, who is now a prostitute and liquor-seller, and persuades her to come back to Ndotsheni with her young son.
A more difficult quest follows when Kumalo and Msimangu begin searching the labyrinthine metropolis of Johannesburg for Absalom. They visit Kumalo’s brother, John, who has become a successful businessman and politician, and he directs them to the factory where his son and Absalom once worked together. One clue leads to another, and as Kumalo travels from place to place, he begins to see the gaping racial and economic divisions that are threatening to split his country. Eventually, Kumalo discovers that his son has spent time in a reformatory and that he has gotten a girl pregnant.
Meanwhile, the newspapers announce that Arthur Jarvis, a prominent white crusader for racial justice, has been murdered in his home by a gang of burglars. Kumalo and Msimangu learn that the police are looking for Absalom, and Kumalo’s worst suspicions are confirmed when Absalom is arrested for Jarvis’s murder. Absalom has confessed to the crime, but he claims that two others, including John Kumalo’s son, Matthew, aided him and that he did not intend to murder Jarvis. With the help of friends, Kumalo obtains a lawyer for Absalom and attempts to understand what his son has become. John, however, makes arrangements for his own son’s defense, even though this split will worsen Absalom’s case. When Kumalo tells Absalom’s pregnant girlfriend what has happened, she is saddened by the news, but she joyfully agrees to his proposal that she marry his son and return to Ndotsheni as Kumalo’s daughter-in-law.
Meanwhile, in the hills above Ndotsheni, Arthur Jarvis’s father, James Jarvis, tends his bountiful land and hopes for rain. The local police bring him news of his son’s death, and he leaves immediately for Johannesburg with his wife. In an attempt to come to terms with what has happened, Jarvis reads his son’s articles and speeches on social inequality and begins a radical reconsideration of his own prejudices. He and Kumalo meet for the first time by accident, and after Kumalo has recovered from his shock, he expresses sadness and regret for Jarvis’s loss. Both men attend Absalom’s trial, a fairly straightforward process that ends with the death penalty for Absalom and an acquittal for his co-conspirators. Kumalo arranges for Absalom to marry the girl who bears his child, and they bid farewell. The morning of his departure, Kumalo rouses his new family to bring them back to Ndotsheni only to find that Gertrude has disappeared.
Kumalo is now deeply aware of how his people have lost the tribal structure that once held them together, and he returns to his village troubled by the situation. It turns out that James Jarvis has been having similar thoughts. Arthur Jarvis’s young son befriends Kumalo, and as the young boy and the old man become acquainted, James Jarvis becomes increasingly involved with helping the struggling village. He donates milk at first, then makes plans for a dam and hires an agricultural expert to demonstrate newer, less devastating farming techniques. When Jarvis’s wife dies, Kumalo and his congregation send a wreath to express their sympathy. Just as the diocese’s bishop is on the verge of transferring Kumalo, Jarvis sends a note of thanks for the wreath and offers to build the congregation a new church, and Kumalo is permitted to stay in his parish.
On the evening before his son’s execution, Kumalo goes into the mountains to await the appointed time in solitude. On the way, he encounters Jarvis, and the two men speak of the village, of lost sons, and of Jarvis’s bright young grandson, whose innocence and honesty have impressed both men. When Kumalo is alone, he weeps for his son’s death and clasps his hands in prayer as dawn breaks over the valley."
Compress,"Kino, Juana, and their infant son, Coyotito, live in a modest brush house by the sea. One morning, calamity strikes when a scorpion stings Coyotito. Hoping to protect their son, Kino and Juana rush him to the doctor in town. When they arrive at the doctor’s gate, they are turned away because they are poor natives who cannot pay enough.
Later that same morning, Kino and Juana take their family canoe, an heirloom, out to the estuary to go diving for pearls. Juana makes a poultice for Coyotito’s wound, while Kino searches the sea bottom. Juana’s prayers for a large pearl are answered when Kino surfaces with the largest pearl either of them has ever seen. Kino lets out a triumphant yell at his good fortune, prompting the surrounding boats to circle in and examine the treasure.
In the afternoon, the whole neighborhood gathers at Kino’s brush house to celebrate his find. Kino names a list of things that he will secure for his family with his newfound wealth, including a church wedding and an education for his son. The neighbors marvel at Kino’s boldness and wonder if he is foolish or wise to harbor such ambitions.
Toward evening, the local priest visits Kino to bless him in his good fortune and to remind him of his place within the church. Shortly thereafter, the doctor arrives, explaining that he was out in the morning but has come now to cure Coyotito. He administers a powdered capsule and promises to return in an hour.
In the intervening period, Coyotito grows violently ill, and Kino decides to bury the pearl under the floor in a corner of the brush house. The doctor returns and feeds Coyotito a potion to quiet his spasms. When the doctor inquires about payment, Kino explains that soon he will sell his large pearl and inadvertently glances toward the corner where he has hidden the pearl. This mention of the pearl greatly intrigues the doctor, and Kino is left with an uneasy feeling.
Before going to bed, Kino reburies the pearl under his sleeping mat. That night, he is roused by an intruder digging around in the corner. A violent struggle ensues, and Kino’s efforts to chase away the criminal leave him bloodied. Terribly upset by this turn of events, Juana proposes that they abandon the pearl, which she considers an agent of evil.
The next morning, Kino and Juana make their way to town to sell the pearl. Juan Tomás, Kino’s brother, advises Kino to be wary of cheats. Indeed, all of the dealers conspire to bid low on the pearl. Kino indignantly refuses to accept their offers, resolving instead to take his pearl to the capital. That evening, as Kino and Juana prepare to leave, Juan Tomás cautions Kino against being overly proud, and Juana repeats her wish to be rid of the pearl. Kino silences her, explaining that he is a man and will take care of things.
In the middle of the night, Juana steals away with the pearl. Kino wakes as she leaves and pursues her, apprehending her just as she is poised to throw the pearl into the sea. He tackles her, takes the pearl back, and beats her violently, leaving her in a crumpled heap on the beach. As he returns to the brush house, a group of hostile men confronts him and tries to take the pearl from him. He fights the men off, killing one and causing the rest to flee, but drops the pearl in the process.
As Juana ascends from the shore to the brush house, she finds the pearl lying in the path. Just beyond, she sees Kino on the ground, next to the dead man. He bemoans the loss of the pearl, which she presents to him. Though Kino explains that he had no intention to kill, Juana insists that he will be labeled a murderer. They resolve to flee at once. Kino rushes back to the shore to prepare the canoe, while Juana returns home to gather Coyotito and their belongings.
Kino arrives at the shore and finds his canoe destroyed by vandals. When he climbs the hill, he sees a fire blazing, and realizes that his house has burned down. Desperate to find refuge, Kino, Juana and Coyotito duck into Juan Tomás’s house, where they hide out for the day. Relieved that the three did not perish in the blaze, as the rest of the neighborhood believes, Juan Tomás and his wife, Apolonia, reluctantly agree to keep Kino and Juana’s secret and provide shelter for them while pretending to be ignorant of their whereabouts.
At nightfall, Kino, Juana, and Coyotito set out for the capital. Skirting the town, they travel north until sunrise and then take covert shelter by the roadside. They sleep for most of the day and are preparing to set out again when Kino discovers that three trackers are following them. After hesitating briefly, Kino decides that they must hurry up the mountain, in hopes of eluding the trackers. A breathless ascent brings them to a water source, where they rest and take shelter in a nearby cave. Kino attempts to mislead the trackers by creating a false trail up the mountain. Kino, Juana, and Coyotito then hide in the cave and wait for an opportunity to escape back down the mountain.
The trackers are slow in their pursuit and finally arrive at the watering hole at dusk. They make camp nearby, and two of the trackers sleep while the third stands watch. Kino decides that he must attempt to attack them before the late moon rises. He strips naked to avoid being seen and sneaks up to striking distance. Just as Kino prepares to attack, Coyotito lets out a cry, waking the sleepers. When one of them fires his rifle in the direction of the cry, Kino makes his move, killing the trackers in a violent fury. In the aftermath, Kino slowly realizes that the rifle shot struck and killed his son in the cave.
The next day, Kino and Juana make their way back through town and the outlying brush houses. Juana carries her dead son slung over her shoulder. They walk all the way to the sea, as onlookers watch in silent fascination. At the shore, Kino pulls the pearl out of his clothing and takes one last, hard look at it. Then, with all his might, under a setting sun, he flings the pearl back into the sea."
Resumes,"Guy Montag is a fireman who burns books in a futuristic American city. In Montag’s world, firemen start fires rather than putting them out. The people in this society do not read books, enjoy nature, spend time by themselves, think independently, or have meaningful conversations. Instead, they drive very fast, watch excessive amounts of television on wall-size sets, and listen to the radio on “Seashell Radio” sets attached to their ears.
Montag encounters a gentle seventeen-year-old girl named Clarisse McClellan, who opens his eyes to the emptiness of his life with her innocently penetrating questions and her unusual love of people and nature. Over the next few days, Montag experiences a series of disturbing events. First, his wife, Mildred, attempts suicide by swallowing a bottle of sleeping pills. Then, when he responds to an alarm that an old woman has a stash of hidden literature, the woman shocks him by choosing to be burned alive along with her books. A few days later, he hears that Clarisse has been killed by a speeding car. Montag’s dissatisfaction with his life increases, and he begins to search for a solution in a stash of books that he has stolen from his own fires and hidden inside an air-conditioning vent.
When Montag fails to show up for work, his fire chief, Beatty, pays a visit to his house. Beatty explains that it’s normal for a fireman to go through a phase of wondering what books have to offer, and he delivers a dizzying monologue explaining how books came to be banned in the first place. According to Beatty, special-interest groups and other “minorities” objected to books that offended them. Soon, books all began to look the same, as writers tried to avoid offending anybody. This was not enough, however, and society as a whole decided to simply burn books rather than permit conflicting opinions. Beatty tells Montag to take twenty-four hours or so to see if his stolen books contain anything worthwhile and then turn them in for incineration. Montag begins a long and frenzied night of reading.
Overwhelmed by the task of reading, Montag looks to his wife for help and support, but she prefers television to her husband’s company and cannot understand why he would want to take the terrible risk of reading books. He remembers that he once met a retired English professor named Faber sitting in a park, and he decides that this man might be able to help him understand what he reads. He visits Faber, who tells him that the value of books lies in the detailed awareness of life that they contain. Faber says that Montag needs not only books but also the leisure to read them and the freedom to act upon their ideas.
Faber agrees to help Montag with his reading, and they concoct a risky scheme to overthrow the status quo. Faber will contact a printer and begin reproducing books, and Montag will plant books in the homes of firemen to discredit the profession and to destroy the machinery of censorship. Faber gives him a two-way radio earpiece (the “green bullet”) so that he can hear what Montag hears and talk to him secretly.
Montag goes home, and soon two of his wife’s friends arrive to watch television. The women discuss their families and the war that is about to be declared in an extremely frivolous manner. Their superficiality angers him, and he takes out a book of poetry and reads “Dover Beach” by Matthew Arnold. Faber buzzes in his ear for him to be quiet, and Mildred tries to explain that the poetry reading is a standard way for firemen to demonstrate the uselessness of literature. The women are extremely disturbed by the poem and leave to file a complaint against Montag.
Montag goes to the fire station and hands over one of his books to Beatty. Beatty confuses Montag by barraging him with contradictory quotations from great books. Beatty exploits these contradictions to show that literature is morbid and dangerously complex, and that it deserves incineration. Suddenly, the alarm sounds, and they rush off to answer the call, only to find that the alarm is at Montag’s own house. Mildred gets into a cab with her suitcase, and Montag realizes that his own wife has betrayed him.
Beatty forces Montag to burn the house himself; when he is done, Beatty places him under arrest. When Beatty continues to berate Montag, Montag turns the flamethrower on his superior and proceeds to burn him to ashes. Montag knocks the other firemen unconscious and runs. The Mechanical Hound, a monstrous machine that Beatty has set to attack Montag, pounces and injects Montag’s leg with a large dose of anesthetic. Montag manages to destroy it with his flamethrower; then he walks off the numbness in his leg and escapes with some books that were hidden in his backyard. He hides these in another fireman’s house and calls in an alarm from a pay phone.
Montag goes to Faber’s house, where he learns that a new Hound has been put on his trail, along with several helicopters and a television crew. Faber tells Montag that he is leaving for St. Louis to see a retired printer who may be able to help them. Montag gives Faber some money and tells him how to remove Montag’s scent from his house so the Hound will not enter it. Montag then takes some of Faber’s old clothes and runs off toward the river. The whole city watches as the chase unfolds on TV, but Montag manages to escape in the river and change into Faber’s clothes to disguise his scent. He drifts downstream into the country and follows a set of abandoned railroad tracks until he finds a group of renegade intellectuals (“the Book People”), led by a man named Granger, who welcome him. They are a part of a nationwide network of book lovers who have memorized many great works of literature and philosophy. They hope that they may be of some help to mankind in the aftermath of the war that has just been declared. Montag’s role is to memorize the Book of Ecclesiastes. Enemy jets appear in the sky and completely obliterate the city with bombs. Montag and his new friends move on to search for survivors and rebuild civilization."
Central,"Warriors Don’t Cry begins when Melba and eight other Black men and women in their forties return to their home state of Arkansas to meet the then-governor, Bill Clinton. Melba, the narrator and author, explains that the group, called the Little Rock Nine, is visiting Central High School in Little Rock. As teenagers in 1957, the nine of them were the first Black students to be integrated into the school.
When Melba is twelve years old, the Supreme Court rules that separate schools for whites are illegal, a ruling called Brown v. the Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas. In the year after the ruling, Melba sees very little change in segregation. She is still at an all-Black high school, but she and sixteen other Black students sign up to attend the white school.
Because of the threat of violence, the number of Black students who will participate in the integration is decreased from seventeen to nine. Several times in the few days before school is supposed to start, lawsuits are filed that threaten to stop the nine students. Arkansas Governor Faubus declares that he is going to send the state National Guard to the high school, though he does not say whether they are there to protect the nine or to stop them from entering the school. Grandma India begins to stay awake at night with a shotgun near her. Finally, a few days after school has started, federal court judge Ronald Davies orders that the students be allowed to attend.
On September 3, 1957, Melba and her mother drive to Central High School for Melba’s first day of class. A huge white mob has gathered, and the Arkansas National Guard encircles the school. Luckily, both Melba and her mother make it to the car and escape unharmed. Melba is not allowed to leave her house or answer the door or the phone. She tells her grandmother that she wants to go back to Horace Mann, her old high school, but her grandmother insists that Melba is not a quitter.
President Eisenhower and Governor Faubus meet and attempt to resolve the problem of integration in Arkansas, but the meeting is unsuccessful, and on September 20, 1957, the State of Arkansas goes to federal court before Judge Davies. Judge Davies rules that the Arkansas National Guard must be removed and that the Little Rock Nine must be allowed into Central High School. Governor Faubus removes the guard and predicts that blood will run in the streets of Little Rock if the schools are integrated.
On Monday, September 23, 1957, Melba and the other Black students go to school. They are again greeted by a mob of angry white people. In the middle of one class, Melba is forced to flee to the principal’s office, as the mob has broken the barricades and is headed for the school. Someone in the principal’s office proposes that they give the crowd one of the children to kill so the others can escape. Gene Smith, the assistant chief of police, smuggles the nine students out of the school. The day after the mob attack, Melba stays home and reads that President Eisenhower has announced he will use force to prevent this kind of mob rule and to enforce federal law. The next day, the 101st Airborne Division (a division of war heroes) arrives in Little Rock.
Each Black student has his or her own escort from the 101st Airborne Division. Melba’s solider, Danny, protects her when someone attempts to throw acid in her eyes. In October, Melba, Ernie, and Minnijean meet with some of Central High’s white students under the guidance of a Norwegian reporter, Mrs. Jorumn Rickets, who hopes to foster some sort of understanding between the two groups. The meeting is a failure. Eisenhower withdraws the 101st Airborne, and the nine students are forced to rely on the Arkansas National Guard for protection. The Nine continue to be terrorized: one day, white girls attack Melba in the showers and hold her under scalding water. At the same time, the newspaper that Mrs. Bates (the President of the NAACP in Little Rock) runs is being financially ruined by white businesspeople, and the State Attorney is threatening NAACP officials across the state.
On December 17th, white boys surround Minnijean in the school cafeteria. Minnijean throws hot chili on two of the boys. Minnijean is suspended. The segregationists start a new chant: “One n***** down and eight to go.” Minnijean is allowed to return to school, and a short while later, a white boy pours a bucket of soup on her head. Later, the boy who poured soup on Minnijean attacks her, and a fight ensues. Nobody knows exactly what happened, but the white students allege that Minnijean fought back. Minnijean is expelled from Central High School, and three white students are suspended. The NAACP arranges for a scholarship for Minnijean at a high school in New York.
One day, Melba is almost surrounded by a group of white boys led by Andy, her main tormentor. She is saved by a white boy named Link, who gives her the keys to his car. That night, Melba returns Link’s car to him, and he begins to warn her of the plans that the segregationists have made for her. Melba and Link become friends. On April 16, Judge Davies is removed from the Little Rock integration lawsuits and replaced by an Arkansas judge named Harry Lemley.
One Saturday morning, Link and Melba visit Nana Healey, Link’s Black nanny. Link thinks that Nana Healey has tuberculosis. Melba finds a doctor in the Black community to tend to her. Nana Healey is dying, and Melba has to tell Link. Meanwhile, the integration case is reopened, with Judge Lemley presiding, and the school board once again asks for a postponement of integration at Central High School. Melba’s mother, Lois, is nearly fired from her teaching job of fourteen years because Melba won’t withdraw from Central High School. The end of the school year is approaching, and the segregationists are desperate to keep Ernie, the oldest of the nine, from graduating. Yet, on May 27, Ernie graduates. The next day, Link calls in tears. Nana Healey has died. Link asks Melba to leave Little Rock with him. Melba agrees to go, knowing she will not follow through with her promise.
By May 29, the Nine (including Minnijean) have begun a tour of the northern states, where they are treated like heroes and celebrities. Meanwhile, the integration effort in Little Rock is disintegrating. Judge Lemley grants the school board’s plea to delay integration for three years. The NAACP sets up a round of appeals, and by September of 1958, the students are gearing up for their second year at Central. Rather than allow that to happen, Governor Faubus shuts down all of Little Rock’s high schools. While Melba is waiting to return to school, Grandma India is diagnosed with leukemia and dies in October of 1958. By September of 1959, the NAACP has decided that the strain on the families is too great. They ask people in NAACP chapters across the country to take in the students. Melba is sent to Santa Rosa, California, to the home of the McCabes, a white Quaker family. The McCabes nurture and care for Melba and convince her to go to college in January of 1960.
In September of 1960, Central is again open to integration, but only two of the nine students are readmitted. They eventually graduate. Melba begins to attend San Francisco State University with predominantly white students. One night in 1962, while she is at school, a white soldier named John comes to her room to meet her roommate. There is mutual attraction, and soon they are engaged to be married. Melba relates how she keeps in touch with Link during this time. But when Link hears that she is getting married, and to a white man, he is furious, as Melba had always maintained she could not date a white man. They never speak again. Six months later, Melba and John are married. They have a daughter named Kelli. Seven years after their daughter’s birth, they split up because Melba wants to be a reporter and work, and John wants a housewife. Melba goes to journalism school at Columbia and becomes a reporter. She ends the book by saying that if her experience at Central High School has taught her anything, it is that we are all one."
Expedience,"Pip, a young orphan living with his sister and her husband in the marshes of Kent, sits in a cemetery one evening looking at his parents’ tombstones. Suddenly, an escaped convict springs up from behind a tombstone, grabs Pip, and orders him to bring him food and a file for his leg irons. Pip obeys, but the fearsome convict is soon captured anyway. The convict protects Pip by claiming to have stolen the items himself.
One day Pip is taken by his Uncle Pumblechook to play at Satis House, the home of the wealthy dowager Miss Havisham, who is extremely eccentric: she wears an old wedding dress everywhere she goes and keeps all the clocks in her house stopped at the same time. During his visit, he meets a beautiful young girl named Estella, who treats him coldly and contemptuously. Nevertheless, he falls in love with her and dreams of becoming a wealthy gentleman so that he might be worthy of her. He even hopes that Miss Havisham intends to make him a gentleman and marry him to Estella, but his hopes are dashed when, after months of regular visits to Satis House, Miss Havisham decides to help him become a common laborer in his family’s business.
With Miss Havisham’s guidance, Pip is apprenticed to his brother-in-law, Joe, who is the village blacksmith. Pip works in the forge unhappily, struggling to better his education with the help of the plain, kind Biddy and encountering Joe’s malicious day laborer, Orlick. One night, after an altercation with Orlick, Pip’s sister, known as Mrs. Joe, is viciously attacked and becomes a mute invalid. From her signals, Pip suspects that Orlick was responsible for the attack.
One day a lawyer named Jaggers appears with strange news: a secret benefactor has given Pip a large fortune, and Pip must come to London immediately to begin his education as a gentleman. Pip happily assumes that his previous hopes have come true—that Miss Havisham is his secret benefactor and that the old woman intends for him to marry Estella.
In London, Pip befriends a young gentleman named Herbert Pocket and Jaggers’s law clerk, Wemmick. He expresses disdain for his former friends and loved ones, especially Joe, but he continues to pine after Estella. He furthers his education by studying with the tutor Matthew Pocket, Herbert’s father. Herbert himself helps Pip learn how to act like a gentleman. When Pip turns twenty-one and begins to receive an income from his fortune, he will secretly help Herbert buy his way into the business he has chosen for himself. But for now, Herbert and Pip lead a fairly undisciplined life in London, enjoying themselves and running up debts. Orlick reappears in Pip’s life, employed as Miss Havisham’s porter, but is promptly fired by Jaggers after Pip reveals Orlick’s unsavory past. Mrs. Joe dies, and Pip goes home for the funeral, feeling tremendous grief and remorse. Several years go by, until one night a familiar figure barges into Pip’s room—the convict, Magwitch, who stuns Pip by announcing that he, not Miss Havisham, is the source of Pip’s fortune. He tells Pip that he was so moved by Pip’s boyhood kindness that he dedicated his life to making Pip a gentleman, and he made a fortune in Australia for that very purpose.
Pip is appalled, but he feels morally bound to help Magwitch escape London, as the convict is pursued both by the police and by Compeyson, his former partner in crime. A complicated mystery begins to fall into place when Pip discovers that Compeyson was the man who abandoned Miss Havisham at the altar and that Estella is Magwitch’s daughter. Miss Havisham has raised her to break men’s hearts, as revenge for the pain her own broken heart caused her. Pip was merely a boy for the young Estella to practice on; Miss Havisham delighted in Estella’s ability to toy with his affections.
As the weeks pass, Pip sees the good in Magwitch and begins to care for him deeply. Before Magwitch’s escape attempt, Estella marries an upper-class lout named Bentley Drummle. Pip makes a visit to Satis House, where Miss Havisham begs his forgiveness for the way she has treated him in the past, and he forgives her. Later that day, when she bends over the fireplace, her clothing catches fire and she goes up in flames. She survives but becomes an invalid. In her final days, she will continue to repent for her misdeeds and to plead for Pip’s forgiveness.
The time comes for Pip and his friends to spirit Magwitch away from London. Just before the escape attempt, Pip is called to a shadowy meeting in the marshes, where he encounters the vengeful, evil Orlick. Orlick is on the verge of killing Pip when Herbert arrives with a group of friends and saves Pip’s life. Pip and Herbert hurry back to effect Magwitch’s escape. They try to sneak Magwitch down the river on a rowboat, but they are discovered by the police, who Compeyson tipped off. Magwitch and Compeyson fight in the river, and Compeyson is drowned. Magwitch is sentenced to death, and Pip loses his fortune. Magwitch feels that his sentence is God’s forgiveness and dies at peace. Pip falls ill; Joe comes to London to care for him, and they are reconciled. Joe gives him the news from home: Orlick, after robbing Pumblechook, is now in jail; Miss Havisham has died and left most of her fortune to the Pockets; Biddy has taught Joe how to read and write. After Joe leaves, Pip decides to rush home after him and marry Biddy, but when he arrives there he discovers that she and Joe have already married.
Pip decides to go abroad with Herbert to work in the mercantile trade. Returning many years later, he encounters Estella in the ruined garden at Satis House. Drummle, her husband, treated her badly, but he is now dead. Pip finds that Estella’s coldness and cruelty have been replaced by a sad kindness, and the two leave the garden hand in hand, Pip believing that they will never part again.

The final Summary and Analysis section of this SparkNote provides a description of the first ending and explains why Dickens rewrote it.)"
Adjustments,"Lawyer Bryan Stevenson gives a first-person account of his decades helping marginalized Americans who have been unfairly and harshly punished by the U.S. criminal justice system, which disproportionately targets people of color and poor people. At the heart of Just Mercy is the story of Walter McMillian, a Black man who was framed for the murder of a girl named Ronda Morrison, convicted, and sent to death row. 
Stevenson alternates chapters about Walter with his personal reflections on our country’s history with racial disparity and issues around incarceration. Stevenson highlights other groups of vulnerable people who have been victimized by the criminal justice system and shares the stories of the prisoners he has helped over the years. The book also follows the growth of Stevenson’s nonprofit law project, the Alabama-based Equal Justice Initiative (EJI), through its expansion from focusing on death row prisoners to helping people sentenced to life without parole. Stevenson chronicles how EJI becomes a significant force in criminal justice reform.
In 1983 as a law student, Stevenson discovers his life’s passion when he interns with the Georgia-based Southern Prisoners Defense Committee and meets his first death row prisoner. After graduation Stevenson accepts a job with the organization to represent poor prisoners, including those in Alabama who lack any public defender. He meets Walter McMillian on Alabama’s death row. Walter owns a successful business but also transgresses racial boundaries when he has an affair with a white woman. Soon after the affair becomes public, the woman’s friend, Ralph Myers, accuses Walter of committing the unsolved murder of Ronda Morrison, which has outraged the community. Law enforcement, including a racist sheriff and the district attorney, eagerly pounces on this accusation, overlooking Walter’s alibi and a lack of evidence. Instead, they actively force Ralph to stick with his story even when he tries to recant. They coerce other false witness testimonies, and—as revealed years later—actively suppress evidence.
After Stevenson and the team at EJI unsuccessfully appeal Walter’s conviction, they launch their own investigation of the crime and uncover new evidence. They find witnesses who can prove the witnesses against Walter lied as well as financial records that indicate that one of these witnesses was paid to give false testimony. Stevenson and his team also petition for and receive all records from Walter’s trial. However, their big break comes when they receive a phone call from Ralph, who now wants to make amends. Ralph admits to lying about Walter and says he was threatened by law enforcement. Stevenson wins a hearing for Walter where he can present his new evidence: Ralph’s testimony, which is confirmed by health care workers and other inmates, as well as recordings of the law enforcement team threatening Ralph if he doesn’t frame Walter. 
While the judge refuses to grant Walter relief, Stevenson continues the appeal process through the Alabama courts. The district attorney asks outside agents to investigate the murder for which Walter was convicted, and the investigators determine that Walter had nothing to do with the crime. Six weeks later, the court invalidates Walter’s conviction. Stevenson and the State file a joint motion to dismiss the charges, and Walter is set free.
Throughout the process, Stevenson and Walter become close friends, and Stevenson helps Walter upon his release, including filing a civil suit on his behalf and offering him a place to stay. Walter works with Stevenson to share his story, giving interviews and speaking at legal conferences, and Walter is even featured in a documentary. Unfortunately, Walter is diagnosed with advancing dementia and is forced to rely on family and eventually a nursing facility for his care. He dies in 2013. Stevenson gives a eulogy at his funeral and shares all he learned from Walter, particularly that we must extend mercy to everyone, even those who have not earned it.
Interspersed with chapters chronicling Walter’s narrative are stories of Stevenson’s other clients and work. His closeness with these prisoners and their horrifying circumstances makes Stevenson more determined to help and causes him to reflect on abstract issues that nevertheless imbue the criminal justice system, like humanity and mercy. Stevenson focuses on several categories of vulnerable people who become trapped in the system, including mentally ill prisoners, disabled prisoners, and poor women who give birth to stillborn babies. 
Stevenson and his team at EJI also become increasingly focused on juvenile offenders who are sometimes tried as adults despite their young age. These offenders may be given de facto death sentences by being sentenced to life without parole and face perilous circumstances when they are housed in adult prisons. Stevenson illustrates how these prisoners retain their own humanity while being forced to live under inhumane conditions. He also discusses some of the qualities common among these types of prisoners: They are generally poor and disproportionately people of color, and most of them lack adequate legal counsel. The juveniles have horrific backgrounds of abuse and neglect.
Stevenson and his team at EJI also work to change the legal system to offer more protection to marginalized people. Several of his cases end up before the U.S. Supreme Court, and he succeeds in winning rulings that ban as unconstitutional the conviction of children to life without parole and the execution of people deemed incompetent from dementia or neurological disease. EJI works to raise public awareness of issues surrounding unfair incarceration, produces groundbreaking reports on racial issues, and sets up programs to help formerly incarcerated people adjust to life on the outside.
Stevenson also reflects on the issues that surround the criminal justice system. His time spent with prisoners awaiting their execution makes him realize how inhumane it is to prepare another human to die. After decades of work, when Stevenson fails to prevent the execution of a man who suffers from an intellectual disability, he momentarily feels unable to continue his work. However, he realizes that he cannot help but be broken by his experiences and comes to understand that it is his own brokenness that allows him to more fully understand the need for mercy and to bring compassion to others. The book ends with Stevenson’s renewed commitment to helping others."
Increasingly,"Michelle Obama grows up in a two-story bungalow on Chicago’s South Side. Her parents, Fraser and Marian Robinson, rent an upstairs apartment from Marian’s aunt and uncle, who live downstairs. Michelle’s father has multiple sclerosis, but he does not let his disability limit him. He works at a water filtration plant and is also a local precinct captain for the Democratic party. Michelle is a smart, determined girl with little tolerance for disorder. She is less sociable than her older brother, Craig, a gifted basketball player who has many friends. Over time, however, Michelle learns to be more outgoing.
Michelle’s parents believe in education. Her mother does volunteer work on behalf of their neighborhood school, which struggles to maintain quality as the neighborhood declines. Fraser and Marian send Craig to a predominantly white Catholic school with a strong basketball program and a rigorous curriculum. When Michelle is ready for high school, she gains admission to Whitney Young, a new magnet school for gifted students. At Whitney Young, her friendship with a daughter of civil rights leader the Reverend Jesse Jackson gives Michelle a chance to observe what life is like for people active in politics.
Michelle follows her brother to Princeton, where she does well. One of her closest friends at Princeton is a Jamaican student named Suzanne; that friendship helps Michelle see that not everyone has to be as organized and driven as she is. Michelle graduates, studies law at Harvard, and goes to work at a high-end law firm in Chicago. By then, however, she realizes that she hates being a lawyer. Her life takes a turn when she is asked to help mentor a male summer associate named Barack Obama. The son of a Black Kenyan father and a white American mother, he is older than Michelle but started law school later, after some years doing other things, including community organizing in Chicago. Barack’s brilliance is quickly apparent to everyone at the firm, and he and Michelle are immediately attracted to each other.
As Michelle and Barack get acquainted, she sees that he has a higher tolerance for turmoil and uncertainty than she does. She also sees his dedication to making the world a better place. However, Michelle faces crushing loss: her friend Suzanne dies of cancer, and her father dies from MS after decades of fighting to live a normal life. Realizing that life is short, Michelle looks for opportunities to transition out of her legal career. Some personal connections lead to a job at city hall, working for Valerie Jarrett, who will become a lifelong friend and ally. Barack, meanwhile, works in the Chicago area for a national get-out-the vote organization. By now, he and Michelle are engaged. They marry in 1992.
Barack is working for a public interest law firm when the opportunity arises for him to run for a seat in the Illinois state senate. By now, Michelle has run a nonprofit organization and is serving as a university dean. Michelle does not like politics and predicts that Barack will not like it, either; but after he wins his race, he turns out to have the right kind of temperament and skills to be a politician. Then Barack loses his mother to cancer, and Michelle suffers a miscarriage. After failed attempts to conceive again, the Obamas turn to in vitro fertilization (IVF) and their first daughter, Malia, is born Michelle becomes director of community outreach at a hospital. 
After a failed campaign for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, daughter Sasha is born. Their burgeoning family and careers but strains on Michelle and Barack, but couples therapy helps them make some useful adjustments. Barack runs for the U.S. Senate and unexpectedly builds a commanding lead even before his speech at the Democratic National Convention boosts his national profile. He wins the Senate race easily.
When Barack moves to Washington, Michelle and the girls stay in Chicago. To her consternation, Barack and a team of advisers are already discussing a 2008 presidential run. She agrees to be part of the campaign but privately thinks that as a Black man, Barack cannot win. During the campaign, there are absurd rumors, circulated by his opponents, about Barack having Muslim ties. Michelle is an asset on the campaign trail, although she is discouraged when a video of one of her speeches is edited down to suggests that she carries a grudge against America. After the August convention, where Michelle gives a well-received speech, Barack and his running mate, Joe Biden, achieve a decisive win. Michelle believes that Barack is the right person to lead the country out of the ongoing economic recession.
The transition between the Bush and Obama administrations is smooth and welcoming. The White House staff is kind and efficient. Michelle and Barack learn to get used to being accompanied by Secret Service agents whenever they go out, but they do their best to keep the girls’ lives as normal as possible. Michelle’s mother, whom Barack and Michelle persuaded to move in with them, declines Secret Service protection altogether.
As First Lady, Michelle must be engaged and productive without overstepping her bounds. Her early work focuses on childhood obesity, through the Let’s Move! initiative to promote exercise and healthy eating. Michelle plants a vegetable garden on the South Lawn. She also promotes post-high school education through her Reach Higher initiative, and education for girls around the world through the Let Girls Learn initiative. Finally, she teams up with the Second Lady, Jill Biden, to improve support for military families through the Joining Forces initiative. 
During Barack’s successful reelection campaign in 2012, Michelle discovers the power of social media. Like the rest of the country, the Obamas are shocked by mass shootings at Sandy Hook School in Newtown, Connecticut and at a Black church in Charleston. The death of a Chicago girl in a drive-by shooting has personal meaning for Michelle: the girl lived not far from Michelle’s old neighborhood and had recently participated in the second inaugural celebration. 
During the 2016 presidential contest, Michelle is appalled by Donald Trump’s past and present behavior and is shocked when he achieves a come-from-behind win over Hillary Clinton. She takes comfort in all the things she and Barack have accomplished over the last eight years and reminds herself that there is much to be optimistic about."
Wonder,"Part One of Wonder is told from August “Auggie” Pullman’s point of view. Auggie was born with a genetic syndrome that gives him tiny ears, low eyes, and a misshapen mouth and jaw. By the time he is twelve, he has endured twenty-seven surgeries. Auggie lives in New York City with his parents, his sister, Olivia or “Via,” and his dog, Daisy, and until the novel begins, he has been homeschooled. 
Mom wants Auggie to go to middle school, but Dad feels hesitant, worried the other students will be cruel. Mom takes Auggie to meet Beecher Prep’s principal, Mr. Tushman, who has arranged for three other students—Jack, Charlotte, and Julian—to give Auggie a tour of the school. On the first day of school, Auggie faces a barrage of shocked reactions and surprised looks as people react to his appearance for the first time. Julian teases and provokes Auggie. Mr. Browne, their English teacher, gives his students a precept every month to think and write about. The first precept is about kindness. Auggie becomes good friends with Jack and a girl named Summer who sits with Auggie at lunch of her own volition. However, on Halloween, Auggie overhears Jack telling others that he wishes Auggie would stop following him around. Hurt and rejected, Auggie questions whether he should be in school at all.
Part Two is told from Via’s point of view. Since Auggie’s birth when she was four, she has had to be independent and take a back seat to Auggie’s needs. After Via returns from spending a few weeks with her grandmother, she sees Auggie as others see him for the first time. As Via enters high school, she feels estranged from her former best friends, Ella and Miranda. Miranda has also been a good friend to Auggie and gave him the astronaut helmet that he wore for several years. Auggie confides to Via what he overheard Jack say on Halloween, and they agree school is hard for everyone, but Via encourages Auggie to “suck it up.”
In Part Three, which is told from Summer’s point of view, Summer explains that she chooses to be Auggie’s friend despite criticism from other students. They work on an Egyptian Museum project at her house, where Auggie learns more about Summer’s personal life, including the fact that her father died. Auggie and Summer talk about death and agree that maybe people get to come back with new faces. They talk openly about Auggie’s appearance. When Jack later asks Summer why Auggie is upset with him, she gives him a hint but isn’t explicit.
Part Four is told by Jack. He recalls the day when he gave Auggie the tour of the school but also recalls having seen him outside an ice cream shop before. He is used to Auggie’s face and genuinely likes him as a friend. One day, Jack has an epiphany and finally understands what Summer’s hint meant and why Auggie has been upset with him. Jack feels guilty that he lied to others about his feelings about Auggie. When Julian calls Auggie a “freak,” Jack punches him in the mouth, but he will not tell Mr. Tushman why. Mr. Tushman sends Jack home until after winter break as punishment. Through Facebook messages, Jack apologizes to Auggie, and the boys are friends again. Julian’s mother tells Mr. Tushman that Auggie doesn’t belong at Beecher Prep, but Mr. Tushman disagrees. After the break, Charlotte describes the students who are on Julian’s side, on Auggie’s side, and neutral. Jack goes to Auggie’s house to work on a science fair project. He meets Via and realizes that she knows about what happened on Halloween. Via introduces Auggie and Jack to her boyfriend, Justin.
Part Five is told by Justin. Although he’s unsettled when he meets Auggie, he likes Via and her family very much, especially compared to his parents, who are divorced and rather absent. At school, Justin is cast as the lead in Our Town, and Via has a small part and serves as an understudy for Miranda, who has been cast as Emily, the female lead. When Justin witnesses Julian and others teasing Jack one day, he tells the boys to leave Jack alone. He learns that Miranda and Via were once close friends, and Via confesses that she hasn't told her parents about the play because she doesn’t want them to bring Auggie. She is ashamed that she feels embarrassed by her brother.
In Part Six, Auggie’s point of view returns. He cringes through the science fair because so many people react to seeing him for the first time. Julian puts mean notes in Auggie’s and Jack’s lockers, but Auggie notices that students are accepting him more. When Auggie gets hearing aids, life improves dramatically. However, when he learns that Via doesn’t want him to go to her play, he angrily explodes. Meanwhile, Daisy must be euthanized, which saddens the whole Pullman family, but ultimately draws them closer together and assuages the discord between Auggie and Via. Auggie attends Via’s play with his parents, and they are delighted when they see her playing the lead. Via and Justin get standing ovations.
Part Seven is told by Miranda. In the summer before high school, at camp, she lies and tells people that she has a brother with a deformed face, which increases her popularity. Miranda’s parents are divorced and distant, but she feels safe with Via’s loving family. However, Miranda changes that summer, both in appearance and in attitude. She is cast as the lead in Our Town, but on opening night, when she sees Auggie in the audience and realizes that no one has come to see her, she pretends to be sick so that Via can play the lead. After the play, Miranda sees Auggie backstage, and they hug. The Pullmans invite her to join them for dinner, and she happily accepts.
Part Eight returns to Auggie’s point of view. When his class, minus Julian, goes to the Broarwood Nature Retreat for three days, he feels both excited and afraid. He has a vision of Daisy on his first morning and enjoys nature walks and campfires and horseback riding. On movie night, when Jack has to use the bathroom, Auggie goes with him. In the woods, they meet a group of seventh graders who say awful things to Auggie. A fight breaks out. Jack and several other boys defend and protect Auggie. Auggie gets hurt and loses his hearing aids. 
When Mom picks him up the next day, Auggie says that he had a great time except for the last night. Dad brings home a new puppy. Back at school, Auggie has become a hero along with Jack and the other boys who defended him in the woods. Julian has become irrelevant, and Auggie learns that Julian won’t return to Beecher Prep the following year. When Dad drops Auggie off for his fifth-grade graduation, Dad admits that he is the one who threw away Auggie’s space helmet years ago. Auggie feels angry but forgives him. During the ceremony, Auggie wins the Henry Ward Beecher Award for his strength and kindness and receives a standing ovation. As the Pullmans walk home, Auggie thanks his mother for sending him to school, and his mother thanks him for being such a wonder."
Violates,"Beloved begins in 1873 in Cincinnati, Ohio, where Sethe, a former slave, has been living with her eighteen-year-old daughter Denver. Sethe’s mother-in-law, Baby Suggs, lived with them until her death eight years earlier. Just before Baby Suggs’s death, Sethe’s two sons, Howard and Buglar, ran away. Sethe believes they fled because of the malevolent presence of an abusive ghost that has haunted their house at 124 Bluestone Road for years. Denver, however, likes the ghost, which everyone believes to be the spirit of her dead sister.
On the day the novel begins, Paul D, whom Sethe has not seen since they worked together on Mr. Garner’s Sweet Home plantation in Kentucky approximately twenty years earlier, stops by Sethe’s house. His presence resurrects memories that have lain buried in Sethe’s mind for almost two decades. From this point on, the story will unfold on two temporal planes. The present in Cincinnati constitutes one plane, while a series of events that took place around twenty years earlier, mostly in Kentucky, constitutes the other. This latter plane is accessed and described through the fragmented flashbacks of the major characters. Accordingly, we frequently read these flashbacks several times, sometimes from varying perspectives, with each successive narration of an event adding a little more information to the previous ones.
From these fragmented memories, the following story begins to emerge: Sethe, the protagonist, was born in the South to an African mother she never knew. When she is thirteen, she is sold to the Garners, who own Sweet Home and practice a comparatively benevolent kind of slavery. There, the other slaves, who are all men, lust after her but never touch her. Their names are Sixo, Paul D, Paul A, Paul F, and Halle. Sethe chooses to marry Halle, apparently in part because he has proven generous enough to buy his mother’s freedom by hiring himself out on the weekends. Together, Sethe and Halle have two sons, Howard and Buglar, as well as a baby daughter whose name we never learn. When she leaves Sweet Home, Sethe is also pregnant with a fourth child. After the eventual death of the proprietor, Mr. Garner, the widowed Mrs. Garner asks her sadistic, vehemently racist brother-in-law to help her run the farm. He is known to the slaves as schoolteacher, and his oppressive presence makes life on the plantation even more unbearable than it had been before. The slaves decide to run.
Schoolteacher and his nephews anticipate the slaves’ escape, however, and capture Paul D and Sixo. Schoolteacher kills Sixo and brings Paul D back to Sweet Home, where Paul D sees Sethe for what he believes will be the last time. She is still intent on running, having already sent her children ahead to her mother-in-law Baby Suggs’s house in Cincinnati. Invigorated by the recent capture, schoolteacher’s nephews seize Sethe in the barn and violate her, stealing the milk her body is storing for her infant daughter. Unbeknownst to Sethe, Halle is watching the event from a loft above her, where he lies frozen with horror. Afterward, Halle goes mad: Paul D sees him sitting by a churn with butter slathered all over his face. Paul D, meanwhile, is forced to suffer the indignity of wearing an iron bit in his mouth.
When schoolteacher finds out that Sethe has reported his and his nephews’ misdeeds to Mrs. Garner, he has her whipped severely, despite the fact that she is pregnant. Swollen and scarred, Sethe nevertheless runs away, but along the way she collapses from exhaustion in a forest. A white girl, Amy Denver, finds her and nurses her back to health. When Amy later helps Sethe deliver her baby in a boat, Sethe names this second daughter Denver after the girl who helped her. Sethe receives further help from Stamp Paid, who rows her across the Ohio River to Baby Suggs’s house. Baby Suggs cleans Sethe up before allowing her to see her three older children.
Sethe spends twenty-eight wonderful days in Cincinnati, where Baby Suggs serves as an unofficial preacher to the black community. On the last day, however, schoolteacher comes for Sethe to take her and her children back to Sweet Home. Rather than surrender her children to a life of dehumanizing slavery, she flees with them to the woodshed and tries to kill them. Only the third child, her older daughter, dies, her throat having been cut with a handsaw by Sethe. Sethe later arranges for the baby’s headstone to be carved with the word “Beloved.” The sheriff takes Sethe and Denver to jail, but a group of white abolitionists, led by the Bodwins, fights for her release. Sethe returns to the house at 124, where Baby Suggs has sunk into a deep depression. The community shuns the house, and the family continues to live in isolation.
Meanwhile, Paul D has endured torturous experiences in a chain gang in Georgia, where he was sent after trying to kill Brandywine, a slave owner to whom he was sold by schoolteacher. His traumatic experiences have caused him to lock away his memories, emotions, and ability to love in the “tin tobacco box” of his heart. One day, a fortuitous rainstorm allows Paul D and the other chain gang members to escape. He travels northward by following the blossoming spring flowers. Years later, he ends up on Sethe’s porch in Cincinnati.
Paul D’s arrival at 124 commences the series of events taking place in the present time frame. Prior to moving in, Paul D chases the house’s resident ghost away, which makes the already lonely Denver resent him from the start. Sethe and Paul D look forward to a promising future together, until one day, on their way home from a carnival, they encounter a strange young woman sleeping near the steps of 124. Most of the characters believe that the woman—who calls herself Beloved—is the embodied spirit of Sethe’s dead daughter, and the novel provides a wealth of evidence supporting this interpretation. Denver develops an obsessive attachment to Beloved, and Beloved’s attachment to Sethe is equally if not more intense. Paul D and Beloved hate each other, and Beloved controls Paul D by moving him around the house like a rag doll and by seducing him against his will.
When Paul D learns the story of Sethe’s “rough choice”—her infanticide—he leaves 124 and begins sleeping in the basement of the local church. In his absence, Sethe and Beloved’s relationship becomes more intense and exclusive. Beloved grows increasingly abusive, manipulative, and parasitic, and Sethe is obsessed with satisfying Beloved’s demands and making her understand why she murdered her. Worried by the way her mother is wasting away, Denver leaves the premises of 124 for the first time in twelve years in order to seek help from Lady Jones, her former teacher. The community provides the family with food and eventually organizes under the leadership of Ella, a woman who had worked on the Underground Railroad and helped with Sethe’s escape, in order to exorcise Beloved from 124. When they arrive at Sethe’s house, they see Sethe on the porch with Beloved, who stands smiling at them, naked and pregnant. Mr. Bodwin, who has come to 124 to take Denver to her new job, arrives at the house. Mistaking him for schoolteacher, Sethe runs at Mr. Bodwin with an ice pick. She is restrained, but in the confusion Beloved disappears, never to return.
Afterward, Paul D comes back to Sethe, who has retreated to Baby Suggs’s bed to die. Mourning Beloved, Sethe laments, “She was my best thing.” But Paul D replies, “You your best thing, Sethe.” The novel then ends with a warning that “[t]his is not a story to pass on.” The town, and even the residents of 124, have forgotten Beloved “[l]ike an unpleasant dream during a troubling sleep.”"
Americansâ,"Ifemelu, a Nigerian woman who lives in Princeton, New Jersey, gets her hair braided in preparation for her upcoming return to Nigeria. She has broken up with her boyfriend, Blaine, closed her popular blog about race, and uprooted her life because she feels weighed down. When she thinks of returning to Nigeria, she can’t help but think of Obinze, her first love, now a wealthy man in Lagos with a wife and daughter. Upon receiving an email from Ifemelu, Obinze becomes distracted. He has stumbled into wealth after his cousin introduces him to a well-connected man. His wife, Kosi, is beautiful and adoring, but they never connected on the emotional level that he and Ifemelu did. That night, he listens to the music he and Ifemelu used to listen to when they made love.
The novel flashes back to Ifemelu’s youth. She and Obinze meet at a party where a friend attempts to set Obinze up with a girl named Ginika. Obinze has admired Ifemelu from afar since transferring to their school, and they immediately hit it off. They date all throughout secondary school and through the start of university. However, university lecturer strikes keep closing the universities, and Obinze and Aunty Uju encourage Ifemelu to apply to school in America. Ifemelu is accepted and then quickly approved for a student visa. Ifemelu and Obinze plan to one day reunite in America. Unfortunately, Ifemelu’s student visa does not allow her to work, and without a full scholarship and stipend, Ifemelu must find a source of income. She applies to jobs using a family friend’s social security card to no avail. In desperation, she agrees to work for a shady tennis coach as his “relaxation assistant,” which involves allowing him to touch her sexually. After one meeting, she never returns to the coach. Out of shame and self-loathing, she stops replying to Obinze’s messages and emails.
Ifemelu’s luck changes when Ginika introduces her to Kimberly, a white woman who needs a babysitter. The steady work offers her a chance to focus on her studies. She meets Kimberly’s wealthy cousin, Curt, who is immediately smitten with her. They start dating, and when Ifemelu graduates, Curt helps her get a job that will sponsor her green card. For the job interview, Ifemelu needs to have her hair relaxed so that it will look professional according to American standards. The relaxer burns her scalp, and her friend Wambui encourages her to try wearing her hair natural. At first, Ifemelu thinks her hair is ugly, but soon grows to love it. One day, she runs into a friend from Nigeria, who asks what happened between her and Obinze. She gives him the cold shoulder, and is upset the rest of the day. Although she explains that the university friend was not an ex-boyfriend, Curt acts possessive.
Meanwhile, Obinze lives as an illegal immigrant in London. His American visa application was rejected because of anti-terror panic after the September 11, 2001 attacks. His mother offers to bring him as a research assistant on a trip to London as a way to get him into Britain. Obinze’s friend links him up with a fellow Nigerian, Vincent, who is willing to let him use his national insurance card in order to work if Obinze will give him a percentage of his income. Obinze agrees and finds a job in a warehouse. Eventually, Vincent demands more money. Obinze refuses, and the next day his boss tells him that someone reported him as an illegal immigrant. Desperate, Obinze tries to find someone to arrange a green card marriage for him. The day Obinze’s wedding is meant to take place, he arrives to the courthouse only to find the police awaiting him. Obinze is deported.
Ifemelu cheats on Curt and ends their relationship. After she writes an email to Wambui detailing her frustration with Curt’s inability to understand the necessity of Essence magazine in a world of beauty magazines catering to white women, Wambui suggests Ifemelu start blogging. Ifemelu starts a blog focusing on her observations on race in America as a non-American Black woman, and her clever posts soon lead to its popularity. At a conference for minority bloggers, she runs into Blaine, a Black American professor at Yale. They begin dating, and Ifemelu moves in with him. When Ifemelu does not attend a protest Blaine organizes against the university’s racial profiling of a Black staff member, they have a major fight and almost break up. However, Barack Obama’s presidential candidacy draws them back together and gives them a joint mission up until the election, and Ifemelu’s subsequent decision to leave.
Aunty Uju calls Ifemelu to tell her that her son, Dike, tried to kill himself. Ifemelu rushes to be with him. Once she’s back in Nigeria, Ifemelu slowly finds her feet. However, she is hesitant to contact Obinze. Finally, she texts him, and he wants to meet up with her as soon as possible. Their attraction is still undeniable. When Obinze asks her why she cut him off, Ifemelu tells him the story of the tennis coach, surprised at her own tears. Obinze holds her hand, and she basks in the safety she feels. After more dates, Ifemelu awkwardly rekindles their sexual relationship, although she does not want to be his mistress. They argue, and Ifemelu calls Obinze a coward for not divorcing Kosi. Shaken, Obinze thinks about Ifemelu’s accusation, and finds truth in it. He asks Kosi for a divorce. Kosi tries to ignore his declaration, reminding him that he has a duty to his family. Obinze decides that he doesn’t want his daughter to grow up with her parents only playing the roles of happy husband and wife. Days later, he shows up at Ifemelu’s flat telling her that he has left Kosi, will continue to be present in his daughter’s life, and wants to be with Ifemelu. Ifemelu invites him in."
Entails,"Divergent is set in the future, in a dystopian version of Chicago that has been divided into five factions: Abnegation, Candor, Amity, Dauntless, and Erudite. The protagonist and narrator is a sixteen-year-old girl from Abnegation named Beatrice Prior.
The novel opens with Beatrice’s mother cutting her hair. Beatrice is worried about the next day’s aptitude test, which is administered to all sixteen-year-olds and will tell her which of the factions she is best suited for. After the test, she will attend the Choosing Ceremony, where she must decide whether to stay in her family’s faction or leave it behind.
Beatrice is sure that her brother Caleb will stay in Abnegation, which values selflessness and humility above all else, but she is conflicted. She has a strong desire to join Dauntless, the faction whose members value bravery. Trying to ignore her feelings, she goes in for her aptitude test, which is administered by a Dauntless woman named Tori. Tori injects Beatrice with a serum that initiates a series of simulations to which Beatrice must respond. After the test is over, Tori leaves the room looking concerned. When she returns, she tells Beatrice she is suited for multiple factions, meaning she’s what’s known as Divergent. Tori warns her not to tell anyone, and Beatrice returns home wondering what her results mean. At dinner that night, she tries to hide her conflicted feelings from her parents and brother.
The following day, all the families of sixteen-year-olds attend the Choosing Ceremony. Beatrice’s entire family is shocked when Caleb picks Erudite. After some hesitation, Beatrice chooses Dauntless. She leaves the building and jumps onto a train with the other initiates, where she meets Christina and Will, who will become her good friends. When they arrive at the Dauntless compound, a boy named Peter insults her. She responds by being the first person to jump into the Pit, Dauntless’s headquarters seven stories below. After a boy named Four helps her up, she introduces herself as Tris. The initiates proceed to the dining hall and Tris meets Eric, the ruthless head trainer of initiates. The next day, Eric tells the trainees that initiation consists of a three-stage ranking process. Those who rank high enough will become members, while the rest will become factionless. Tris vows to succeed and performs well on the first day of stage one, which involves shooting guns at targets. That night, Christina outfits Tris with flattering clothes and makeup, and she gets three birds tattooed on her collarbone to represent her family.
Next, the initiates must fight each other in an arena and try to knock each other unconscious. When Christina concedes to her opponent, Eric forces her to hang over a chasm in the Pit for five minutes as punishment. The following day, Tris finds that Peter has spray painted the word “Stiff” all over her bed. He also beats her in that day’s fight, sending her to the infirmary. She begins having doubts about her place in her new faction, and her worries intensify during a field trip to the compound wall to learn about Dauntless jobs. Late that night, Eric and Four take the initiates to Navy Pier, an abandoned park in the city, to play capture the flag. As Tris and Four climb a Ferris wheel so they can see where the other team is hiding, Tris realizes she’s starting to like him. She leads their team to victory, impressing Four and angering Eric. The following day, Tris’s friend Al performs badly during a knife-throwing exercise, and Eric orders him to stand in front of the target while others throw knives at him. Tris offers to take Al’s place, and Four throws knives around her head, nicking her ear.
Peter and his friends Molly and Drew continue to torment Tris. After they steal her towel and mock her naked body, she takes revenge by beating Molly up during their assigned fight. Tris finds comfort in her mother’s presence on Visiting Day, but the reunion is marred when Will’s sister accuses Tris’s former faction of hoarding food and goods. Taking Tris aside, her mother asks about her rankings and tells her to convince Caleb to research the simulation serum. The conversation makes Tris realize her mother must have come from Dauntless. Back in the dorm, Al puts his arm around Tris, but she rebuffs him. Later that evening, the rankings show that Tris in sixth place and Peter in second. That night, Edward, who placed first, gets stabbed in the eye, presumably by a jealous Peter. Tris is happy for a distraction the next day, when she gets invited to zip line off the top of the Hancock building with the Dauntless-born initiates.
In the second stage of initiation, the initiates are injected with a serum that induces a fear simulation. After Tris’s first simulation, Four informs her she was able to escape the test much faster than anyone else. Still, she is stressed about the tests and angry at Peter, who’s been distributing Erudite reports accusing Abnegation of corruption. After another trip to the tattoo parlor, she flirts with a drunken Four. During her next simulation, she escapes the hallucination by manipulating it, leading Four to realize she’s Divergent. He warns her not to share her status with anyone. She again talks with Tori, who tells Tris that Dauntless leaders killed her brother when they learned he was Divergent.
Because she’s able to manipulate the simulations, Tris ranks first after stage two, leading Peter to threaten her. One night, as she gets a drink of water in the hallway, she hears Eric talking with an unknown woman about Divergent rebels. Suddenly, she’s attacked from behind and taken to the chasm by Peter, Drew, and Al. One of the boys gropes her chest, and Peter nearly drops her over the edge before Four rescues her. As she recovers in Four’s private room, he advises Tris to feign weakness to stay safe, and they grow closer.
The next day, Tris refuses to accept Al’s apologies, and he commits suicide a few hours later by jumping into the chasm. At his funeral, Eric calls him brave, making Tris angry. She vents loudly about Dauntless’s warped priorities to Four, who warns her that she’s being watched. Frustrated and confused, she blows off steam with her friends by throwing stacks of Erudite reports into the chasm.
During stage three, the initiates are forced to confront all their worst fears in a simulation, but this time everyone knows the scenarios are made up, not just Tris. Tris follows Four up to the fear simulation room, where he sometimes goes to practice facing his phobias. He invites Tris into his simulation, and she learns he has only four fears. One of them is his father Marcus, who is Tris’s father’s colleague. After Tris helps Four through each scenario, he asks her to call him by his real name, Tobias, and they kiss.
The following day, Tobias ignores Tris in public, upsetting her. The initiates must go through a sample fear scenario, and Tris panics during hers, causing Tobias to rebuke her. She slaps him and leaves the Dauntless compound to see her brother Caleb in Erudite. When she finds him, he expresses loyalty to Erudite, angering her. She tells him their mother wants him to research the simulation serum, and then is taken by two men to see Jeanine, the Erudite leader. Jeanine asks probing questions about Tris’s test results, and Tris lies hide her Divergence. Back at Dauntless, when Eric threatens her with punishment for leaving, she and Tobias pretend she was sulking because Tobias rejected her. That night, Tobias takes Tris into the city and shows her that Erudite’s lights are on, a major rule violation. He has discovered that Erudite is planning a war against Abnegation, though he’s not sure how Dauntless is involved.
For the final test, each trainee goes through their fear simulation in front of a panel of judges, with the other initiates watching on screens. During Tris’s simulation, she realizes she needs to feel a sense of control in order to escape. Her creative thinking helps her manage her fears of crows, drowning, burning at the stake, kidnapping, and sex. Lastly, instead of following orders to shoot everyone in her family, she offers to sacrifice her own life. Afterward, Eric congratulates her on passing the test and informs her that all Dauntless members must be fitted with a tracking device. Though she’s suspicious, she allows him to inject her with the tracking serum. Back in Tobias’s room, Tris expresses her worries about sex, and she and Tobias agree they’re not ready for it. They go to the banquet, where Tris learns she’s placed first in the rankings. As she and Tobias kiss, she suddenly realizes the Erudite must be planning to use the tracking devices to control the Dauntless.
Tris doesn’t have time to share her realization with Tobias, and in the middle of the night, she awakens to find everyone leaving the dorm in a trance. Since she’s Divergent, the serum hasn’t worked on her, but she follows the group onto a train. There, she discovers Tobias is also awake, meaning he’s Divergent too. When they arrive at Abnegation, the Dauntless begin shooting everyone in sight. After she stops Eric from killing Tobias, Tris gets shot in the shoulder. She and Tobias are taken to Jeanine, who explains her plot to take over the government. She injects Tobias with a serum that makes him attack Tris. He’s sent away, while Tris is knocked unconscious.
Tris wakes up in a glass box filling slowly with water, just like in her simulations. Before she can drown, her mother appears and saves Tris’s life. Her mother is killed by Dauntless soldiers shortly afterward, and Tris kills Will in the process of escaping. She finds her father and brother hiding with other Abnegation members, including Marcus, Tobias’s father. They treat her wound, then head toward the control room at Dauntless headquarters. Tris leads her family into the Pit, where she finds Peter acting as a guard. Tris forces Peter to lead them to the control room, and her father is killed in the process of helping her. She finds Tobias, still under the influence of Jeanine’s serum, manning the computer program. They struggle to get each other’s weapons, and after she lets Tobias take her gun, she pleads with him to see her. He comes out of his trance and stops the computer program. Taking the hard drive with them, they reunite with Caleb and Marcus, then jump on a train heading toward Amity headquarters. Tris notices that Marcus seems interested in the hard drive and wonders what will happen next."
Bombastic,"The year is 1775, and social ills plague both France and England. Jerry Cruncher, an odd-job man who works for Tellson’s Bank, stops the Dover mail-coach with an urgent message for Jarvis Lorry. The message instructs Lorry to wait at Dover for a young woman, and Lorry responds with the cryptic words, “Recalled to Life.” At Dover, Lorry is met by Lucie Manette, a young orphan whose father, a once-eminent doctor whom she supposed dead, has been discovered in France. Lorry escorts Lucie to Paris, where they meet Defarge, a former servant of Doctor Manette, who has kept Manette safe in a garret. Driven mad by eighteen years in the Bastille, Manette spends all of his time making shoes, a hobby he learned while in prison. Lorry assures Lucie that her love and devotion can recall her father to life, and indeed they do.
The year is now 1780. Charles Darnay stands accused of treason against the English crown. A bombastic lawyer named Stryver pleads Darnay’s case, but it is not until his drunk, good-for-nothing colleague, Sydney Carton, assists him that the court acquits Darnay. Carton clinches his argument by pointing out that he himself bears an uncanny resemblance to the defendant, which undermines the prosecution’s case for unmistakably identifying Darnay as the spy the authorities spotted. Lucie and Doctor Manette watched the court proceedings, and that night, Carton escorts Darnay to a tavern and asks how it feels to receive the sympathy of a woman like Lucie. Carton despises and resents Darnay because he reminds him of all that he himself has given up and might have been.
In France, the cruel Marquis Evrémonde runs down a plebian child with his carriage. Manifesting an attitude typical of the aristocracy in regard to the poor at that time, the Marquis shows no regret, but instead curses the peasantry and hurries home to his chateau, where he awaits the arrival of his nephew, Darnay, from England. Arriving later that night, Darnay curses his uncle and the French aristocracy for its abominable treatment of the people. He renounces his identity as an Evrémonde and announces his intention to return to England. That night, the Marquis is murdered; the murderer has left a note signed with the nickname adopted by French revolutionaries: “Jacques.”
A year passes, and Darnay asks Manette for permission to marry Lucie. He says that, if Lucie accepts, he will reveal his true identity to Manette. Carton, meanwhile, also pledges his love to Lucie, admitting that, though his life is worthless, she has helped him dream of a better, more valuable existence. On the streets of London, Jerry Cruncher gets swept up in the funeral procession for a spy named Roger Cly. Later that night, he demonstrates his talents as a “Resurrection-Man,” sneaking into the cemetery to steal and sell Cly’s body. In Paris, meanwhile, another English spy known as John Barsad drops into Defarge’s wine shop. Barsad hopes to turn up evidence concerning the mounting revolution, which is still in its covert stages. Madame Defarge sits in the shop knitting a secret registry of those whom the revolution seeks to execute. Back in London, Darnay, on the morning of his wedding, keeps his promise to Manette; he reveals his true identity and, that night, Manette relapses into his old prison habit of making shoes. After nine days, Manette regains his presence of mind, and soon joins the newlyweds on their honeymoon. Upon Darnay’s return, Carton pays him a visit and asks for his friendship. Darnay assures Carton that he is always welcome in their home.
The year is now 1789. The peasants in Paris storm the Bastille and the French Revolution begins. The revolutionaries murder aristocrats in the streets, and Gabelle, a man charged with the maintenance of the Evrémonde estate, is imprisoned. Three years later, he writes to Darnay, asking to be rescued. Despite the threat of great danger to his person, Darnay departs immediately for France.
As soon as Darnay arrives in Paris, the French revolutionaries arrest him as an emigrant. Lucie and Manette make their way to Paris in hopes of saving him. Darnay remains in prison for a year and three months before receiving a trial. In order to help free him, Manette uses his considerable influence with the revolutionaries, who sympathize with him for having served time in the Bastille. Darnay receives an acquittal, but that same night he is arrested again. The charges, this time, come from Defarge and his vengeful wife. Carton arrives in Paris with a plan to rescue Darnay and obtains the help of John Barsad, who turns out to be Solomon Pross, the long-lost brother of Miss Pross, Lucie’s loyal servant.
At Darnay’s trial, Defarge produces a letter that he discovered in Manette’s old jail cell in the Bastille. The letter explains the cause of Manette’s imprisonment. Years ago, the brothers Evrémonde (Darnay’s father and uncle) enlisted Manette’s medical assistance. They asked him to tend to a woman, whom one of the brothers had raped, and her brother, whom the same brother had stabbed fatally. Fearing that Manette might report their misdeeds, the Evrémondes had him arrested. Upon hearing this story, the jury condemns Darnay for the crimes of his ancestors and sentences him to die within twenty-four hours. That night, at the Defarge’s wine shop, Carton overhears Madame Defarge plotting to have Lucie and her daughter (also Darnay’s daughter) executed as well; Madame Defarge, it turns out, is the surviving sibling of the man and woman killed by the Evrémondes. Carton arranges for the Manettes’ immediate departure from France. He then visits Darnay in prison, tricks him into changing clothes with him, and, after dictating a letter of explanation, drugs his friend unconscious. Barsad carries Darnay, now disguised as Carton, to an awaiting coach, while Carton, disguised as Darnay, awaits execution. As Darnay, Lucie, their child, and Dr. Manette speed away from Paris, Madame Defarge arrives at Lucie’s apartment, hoping to arrest her. There she finds the supremely protective Miss Pross. A scuffle ensues, and Madame Defarge dies by the bullet of her own gun. Sydney Carton meets his death at the guillotine, and the narrator confidently asserts that Carton dies with the knowledge that he has finally imbued his life with meaning."
Planting,"In Born a Crime: Stories from a South African Childhood, comedian and television personality Trevor Noah gives a heartfelt and funny recounting of his experiences growing up in South Africa as an oppressed person. Stories of Noah’s life are interspersed with insights into South Africa’s culture, systems, and history. Noah was born in 1984 to a single mother, Patricia, during the time of racial segregation known as apartheid. Patricia was a strong, driven woman who paid little heed to the racist laws that oppressed her. Noah’s father, Robert, agreed to give Patricia a child during a time when sexual relationships between black and white South Africans were illegal. Robert, a Swiss immigrant, never supported segregation and did what he could to undermine apartheid. Because it was dangerous for Patricia and Robert to be seen with their mixed-race child, Noah recalls sometimes being momentarily abandoned by his parents in public settings.
Dutch colonizers came to South Africa in the 1600s and used slave labor to run their farms on stolen land. The white South Africans called Afrikaners are descended from these colonizers. Black South Africans, from tribes including the Zulu, Xhosa, and Sotho tribes, were subjugated under apartheid law until the mid-1990s. A third racial group emerged from the intermingling of the Black and white South Africans: mixed-race or “colored.” Both during apartheid and after its dissolution, mixed-race South Africans were the most marginalized and disenfranchised people. Noah often felt defined by what he wasn’t: not light enough to be labeled as white and not dark enough to be fully accepted into Black culture.
Apartheid ended in 1994, but Noah’s struggles as a mixed-race child in South Africa continued. It was often hard for Noah to determine which groups would accept him. Patricia had always encouraged her son to read and think independently; she valued education and made sure that her son spoke multiple languages. Of the eleven official languages in South Africa, Noah could speak Zulu, Tsonga, English, and Afrikaans. This skill allowed him to move among different racial and cultural groups at school. Though Noah felt out of place in many social settings, his ability to talk and empathize with many different types of people served him well throughout his life. Even at a young age, Noah understood that the bullying he experienced from his mixed-race peers was likely a result of the self-hatred all mixed-race South Africans had been taught. Noah was a mischievous child, but Patricia believed in tempering her punishments with assurances to her son that she held him accountable because she loved him. Patricia knew that the world would not always be kind and generous to Noah, and she wanted to prepare him well.
During his high school years, Noah acquired a small bootleg CD business from a friend. Noah soon found that he could make more money working with his friend Sizwe, who was from the poorer, crowded Johannesburg township called Alexandra—known to most residents as Alex. After graduation Noah moved to Alex to expand his profits, with Sizwe’s help. Sizwe recognized that Noah had talent as a live DJ, and the pair formed a performance group. Noah and his group sold bootleg and mixed CDs, dealt in stolen goods, performed at parties and concerts, and did their best to avoid confrontations with local law enforcement. Noah was already familiar with the South African police. Patricia received no help from the local police when she tried to file charges against her abusive husband. Noah was arrested for shoplifting, on suspicion of carrying a weapon, and for driving an unregistered vehicle. One arrest kept Noah in jail for several days, and Patricia had to pay for his lawyer. Despite his dealings with law enforcement, Noah could see his own privilege in comparison to many of his peers. Patricia had worked hard to make sure her son had the ability to make a life for himself.
The men in Noah’s life taught him little about how to interact with women. Robert was a distant but generally pleasant presence. Patricia’s father, Temperance Noah, was an unpredictable figure. Later, Noah would learn that his grandfather had bipolar disorder and would often beat his wife, Frances. Patricia experienced abuse in her marriage as well. Noah’s stepfather, Abel, became acquainted with Patricia and her young son during their many visits to the automotive shop where Abel worked on their run-down car. After Abel and Patricia married, he bought the shop. Patricia was forced to sell her home to keep the business running, and the family spent a stressful year living in the shop warehouse. Abel often came home drunk, and he began beating his wife. Once Abel had sons of his own, Noah’s half-brothers Andrew and Isaac, Abel’s hostility toward Patricia’s oldest son grew. When Patricia learned that her violent husband had bought a gun, she helped Noah move out on his own. 
One day, Noah received a phone call from Andrew with news that Abel, now estranged from his family, had come to Patricia’s new house and shot her in the head as she was shielding Andrew and Isaac. Miraculously, Patricia survived. Noah was able to cover her medical bills, and Patricia thanked God for protecting her and giving her a son who could afford to help her."
Inured,"Cadence, nearly eighteen, narrates her story in the first person. In Part One (“Welcome”), she describes the three generations of her family, the Sinclairs; Granddad, widowed; his three daughters, all divorced or separated from their husbands; and Cadence and her six cousins. The family spends every summer on a family-owned island. One aunt’s longtime boyfriend and his nephew, Gat, always join them there, even though Granddad doesn’t like the fact that they are of South Asian descent. Cadence, her two oldest cousins, and Gat are known in the family as “the Liars,” for unexplained reasons. Cadence and Gat fell in love when Cadence was fourteen, but the next summer there was an accident of some sort. Cadence doesn’t recall much, but apparently she suffered a head injury. She now has migraines, for which she takes prescription pain medication. None of the Liars stayed in touch with Cadence during her long recovery. The following summer, when her father took her on a trip to Europe, they didn’t reply to her emails.
In Part Two (“Vermont”), Cadence struggles to remember more of her accident. When she asks Penny for details, Penny replies tearfully that Cadence has asked many times before, and always finds the answers upsetting. When Cadence’s father wants to take her to Europe again next summer, Cadence insists on returning to the island. Her mother and father reluctantly settle on a plan for her to spend just the first month of the summer there. Meanwhile, it becomes clear during a visit from Granddad and a phone call with one of the younger cousins that all is not well with the family. Granddad’s mind is starting to fail, the younger cousins gossip about Cadence being a drug addict, and the cousin on the phone thinks the island is haunted.
Part Three (“Summer Seventeen”) begins with Cadence’s arrival at the island. To her shock, the old Victorian house where Granddad and Granny used to live has been completely rebuilt, as an unattractive modern structure. She reunites awkwardly with her aunts and the younger cousins, but her reunion with the Liars goes better, despite her resentment over not hearing from them in the last two years. The four Liars agree to stay together and not to spend much time with the rest of the family. Over the next week or two, Cadence begins to remember what happened two summers ago. Granddad and his daughters argued about the family home back in Boston. One aunt was resentful over the condition of her house on the island. Granddad also snapped at Cadence one day, about his right to do with his money as he pleased. In the present, Cadence makes progress reconnecting with the Liars, but they’re not very responsive to her questions about her accident.
In Part Four (“Look, a Fire”), Cadence starts to grasp what really happened. There had been an ugly showdown between Granddad and his daughters, about the division of the family inheritance. The fight ended with all four adults angrily leaving the island for a short time, taking the younger cousins with them. The Liars stayed behind. Since much of the family conflict had been about Granddad’s house and its contents, the Liars had deliberately burned the house down. Cadence is pleased that in the new house, Granddad and his daughters treat each other more kindly. Cadence’s feelings change, however, when she realizes that Granddad’s two dogs died in the fire. She and the other Liars are responsible for their deaths.
In Part Five (“Truth”), finally, Cadence confronts the whole truth: she alone survived the fire. The other three Liars died. They have spent the last few weeks with Cadence as ghosts, waiting for her to remember and understand. Now the Liars must leave. Cadence says final goodbyes to her two cousins and her beloved Gat. She carries with her the guilty knowledge of her role in their deaths. She is resolved to be kinder toward her surviving family from now on."
Democrat,"The convict Jean Valjean is released from a French prison after serving nineteen years for stealing a loaf of bread and for subsequent attempts to escape from prison. When Valjean arrives at the town of Digne, no one is willing to give him shelter because he is an ex-convict. Desperate, Valjean knocks on the door of M. Myriel, the kindly bishop of Digne. Myriel treats Valjean with kindness, and Valjean repays the bishop by stealing his silverware. When the police arrest Valjean, Myriel covers for him, claiming that the silverware was a gift. The authorities release Valjean and Myriel makes him promise to become an honest man. Eager to fulfill his promise, Valjean masks his identity and enters the town of Montreuil-sur-mer. Under the assumed name of Madeleine, Valjean invents an ingenious manufacturing process that brings the town prosperity. He eventually becomes the town’s mayor.
Fantine, a young woman from Montreuil, lives in Paris. She falls in love with Tholomyès, a wealthy student who gets her pregnant and then abandons her. Fantine returns to her home village with her daughter, Cosette. On the way to Montreuil, however, Fantine realizes that she will never be able to find work if the townspeople know that she has an illegitimate child. In the town of Montfermeil, she meets the Thénardiers, a family that runs the local inn. The Thénardiers agree to look after Cosette as long as Fantine sends them a monthly allowance.
In Montreuil, Fantine finds work in Madeleine’s factory. Fantine’s coworkers find out about Cosette, however, and Fantine is fired. The Thénardiers demand more money to support Cosette, and Fantine resorts to prostitution to make ends meet. One night, Javert, Montreuil’s police chief, arrests Fantine. She is to be sent to prison, but Madeleine intervenes. Fantine has fallen ill, and when she longs to see Cosette, Madeleine promises to send for her. First, however, he must contend with Javert, who has discovered Madeleine’s criminal past. Javert tells Madeleine that a man has been accused of being Jean Valjean, and Madeleine confesses his true identity. Javert shows up to arrest Valjean while Valjean is at Fantine’s bedside, and Fantine dies from the shock.
After a few years, Valjean escapes from prison and heads to Montfermeil, where he is able to buy Cosette from the Thénardiers. The Thénardiers turn out to be a family of scoundrels who abuse Cosette while spoiling their own two daughters, Eponine and Azelma. Valjean and Cosette move to a run-down part of Paris. Javert discovers their hideout, however, and they are forced to flee. They find refuge in a convent, where Cosette attends school and Valjean works as a gardener.
Marius Pontmercy is a young man who lives with his wealthy grandfather, M. Gillenormand. Because of political differences within the family, Marius has never met his father, Georges Pontmercy. After his father dies, however, Marius learns more about him and comes to admire his father’s democratic politics. Angry with his grandfather, Marius moves out of Gillenormand’s house and lives as a poor young law student. While in law school, Marius associates with a group of radical students, the Friends of the ABC, who are led by the charismatic Enjolras. One day, Marius sees Cosette at a public park. It is love at first sight, but the protective Valjean does his utmost to prevent Cosette and Marius from ever meeting. Their paths cross once again, however, when Valjean makes a charitable visit to Marius’s poor neighbors, the Jondrettes. The Jondrettes are in fact the Thénardiers, who have lost their inn and moved to Paris under an assumed name. After Valjean leaves, Thénardier announces a plan to rob Valjean when he returns. Alarmed, Marius alerts the local police inspector, who turns out to be Javert. The ambush is foiled and the Thénardiers are arrested, but Valjean escapes before Javert can identify him.
Thénardier’s daughter Eponine, who is in love with Marius, helps Marius discover Cosette’s whereabouts. Marius is finally able to make contact with Cosette, and the two declare their love for each other. Valjean, however, soon shatters their happiness. Worried that he will lose Cosette and unnerved by political unrest in the city, Valjean announces that he and Cosette are moving to England. In desperation, Marius runs to his grandfather, M. Gillenormand, to ask for M. Gillenormand’s permission to marry Cosette. Their meeting ends in a bitter argument. When Marius returns to Cosette, she and Valjean have disappeared. Heartbroken, Marius decides to join his radical student friends, who have started a political uprising. Armed with two pistols, Marius heads for the barricades.
The uprising seems doomed, but Marius and his fellow students nonetheless stand their ground and vow to fight for freedom and democracy. The students discover Javert among their ranks, and, realizing that he is a spy, Enjolras ties him up. As the army launches its first attack against the students, Eponine throws herself in front of a rifle to save Marius’s life. As Eponine dies in Marius’s arms, she hands him a letter from Cosette. Marius quickly scribbles a reply and orders a boy, Gavroche, to deliver it to Cosette.
Valjean manages to intercept the note and sets out to save the life of the man his daughter loves. Valjean arrives at the barricade and volunteers to execute Javert. When alone with Javert, however, Valjean instead secretly lets him go free. As the army storms the barricade, Valjean grabs the wounded Marius and flees through the sewers. When Valjean emerges hours later, Javert immediately arrests him. Valjean pleads with Javert to let him take the dying Marius to Marius’s grandfather. Javert agrees. Javert feels tormented, torn between his duty to his profession and the debt he owes Valjean for saving his life. Ultimately, Javert lets Valjean go and throws himself into the river, where he drowns.
Marius makes a full recovery and is reconciled with Gillenormand, who consents to Marius and Cosette’s marriage. Their wedding is a happy one, marred only when Valjean confesses his criminal past to Marius. Alarmed by this revelation and unaware that it was Valjean who saved his life at the barricades, Marius tries to prevent Cosette from having contact with Valjean. Lonely and depressed, Valjean takes to his bed and awaits his death. Marius eventually finds out from Thénardier that Valjean saved Marius’s life. Ashamed that he mistrusted Valjean, Marius tells Cosette everything that has happened. Marius and Cosette rush to Valjean’s side just in time for a final reconciliation. Happy to be reunited with his adopted daughter, Valjean dies in peace."
Discuss,"Never Let Me Go takes place in a dystopian version of late 1990s England, where the lives of ordinary citizens are prolonged through a state-sanctioned program of human cloning. The clones, referred to as students, grow up in special institutions away from the outside world. As young adults, they begin to donate their vital organs. All “donors” receive care from designated “carers,” clones who have not yet begun the donation process. The clones continue to donate organs until they “complete,” which is a euphemism for death after the donation of three or four organs. However, this premise is not immediately apparent to the reader. At the start of the novel, narrator Kathy H. merely introduces herself as a thirty-one-year-old carer. She has been a carer for nearly twelve years, but will leave her role in a few months. Kathy explains that she wants to revisit her memories of Tommy and Ruth, two friends who grew up with her at the Hailsham school. Kathy does not explain the donation program, or mention that Hailsham students are clones.
Although Kathy’s narration is often nonlinear, the novel’s three parts roughly align with three stages in her life. In Part One, Kathy remembers her childhood at Hailsham. She describes her friendship with Ruth, whose temperamental personality contrasts with her own quiet demeanor. At Hailsham, Ruth often annoys Kathy by pretending to have special knowledge and privileges. Kathy also describes Tommy, a student known for throwing violent temper tantrums. Tommy is initially an outcast among his peers because he lacks artistic ability, which the Hailsham staff (part teacher, part parent figures known as “guardians”), and its students value highly. Kathy sympathizes with Tommy, and tries to calm him down during one of his tantrums. Tommy later learns to control his temper after a guardian named Miss Lucy assures him that it is not necessary for him to be creative.
Although the students learn vaguely about the donation program, their guardians shield them from a full understanding of their future. Miss Lucy disagrees with this indirect approach, and often exhibits strange behavior in front of the students as a result, in one instance telling them explicitly about their futures. After Miss Lucy speaks with Tommy about his artwork, he and Kathy theorize that creativity may be connected to donations. They speculate about Madame, a woman who visits Hailsham to collect the best student artwork. Madame is rumored to keep this art in a personal gallery. Kathy later encounters Madame in the girls’ dormitory, while Kathy dances to the song “Never Let Me Go.” The song is Kathy’s favorite track on Songs After Dark, a Judy Bridgewater album that is one of her most prized possessions. When the song ends, Kathy sees Madame crying in the doorway. Shortly afterwards, Kathy loses her tape. Tommy’s temper returns during their last summer at Hailsham. Kathy thinks he is upset about his recent breakup with Ruth, whom he has dated for six months. But Tommy is upset about Miss Lucy, who recently told him that she was wrong to dismiss the importance of creativity. Miss Lucy departs Hailsham abruptly, and Tommy mends his relationship with Ruth.
In Part Two, Kathy moves with Ruth and Tommy to a transitional housing facility known as the Cottages. They adjust to their new lives, becoming acquainted with the “veteran” students living there already. Ruth often ignores Tommy and Kathy in her efforts to blend in with the veterans, who are not from Hailsham. Kathy notices that the veterans regard the Hailsham students with awe. One couple, Chrissie and Rodney, are especially interested in Hailsham. They convince Ruth to go with them to Norfolk, where Rodney claims to have seen Ruth’s “possible” in an open-plan office (a “possible” is a human that resembles a specific clone and from whom that clone's DNA may have been copied). Kathy is skeptical of Rodney’s story, especially since it features Ruth’s “dream future” of working in an open-plan office. In the end, Kathy, Tommy, Ruth, Rodney, and Chrissie all drive to Norfolk.
In Norfolk, Chrissie and Rodney ask about a rumored exception allowing Hailsham couples in love to defer their donations. Ruth pretends to know something about deferrals, which surprises Kathy and Tommy. The students eventually find the open-plan office. Rodney points to a woman in the window, and they all agree that she could be Ruth’s legitimate possible. They follow her to an art gallery, where they realize that the woman does not actually resemble Ruth. In her disappointment, Ruth says that the students are modeled only on “trash.” Ruth goes off with Chrissie and Rodney. Meanwhile, Tommy and Kathy find a copy of Kathy’s lost tape in a secondhand store. Tommy tells Kathy that he has begun drawing pictures of imaginary animals. He thinks Madame uses the students’ artwork to determine if couples applying for deferrals are truly in love. After Norfolk, Ruth stops talking about her dream future. Tommy shows his drawings to Kathy, who finds them puzzling but captivating. Meanwhile, Kathy’s friendship with Ruth grows increasingly tense. Ruth reveals that she knows Kathy likes Tommy, but says that Tommy will never return Kathy’s feelings. Shortly afterwards, Kathy submits her application for carer training and departs.
Part Three focuses on Kathy’s time as carer. While Kathy is good at her job, the work is both difficult and lonely. She unexpectedly runs into a Hailsham friend named Laura, who is also a carer. They talk about Ruth, who had a bad first donation. They also talk about Hailsham, which has closed. Kathy becomes Ruth’s carer, but their relationship is strained and guarded. One day, Ruth expresses a desire to visit a beached fishing boat near Tommy’s recovery center. They pick up Tommy on the way to the boat, which they find bleached and crumbling in a marsh. The marsh reminds both Tommy and Ruth of Hailsham. They also discuss Chrissie, who completed on her second donation. On the return trip, Ruth apologizes for keeping Tommy and Kathy apart. She encourages them to pursue a deferral, revealing that she has discovered Madame’s home address. In the weeks that follow, Kathy and Ruth reminisce peacefully about Hailsham and the Cottages. Ruth also encourages Kathy to become Tommy’s carer.
Ruth completes after her second donation. Tommy gives his third donation, and Kathy becomes his carer. They spend their days reading and talking at his recovery center. Eventually, they also begin to have sex. Hoping to pursue a deferral, they go to visit Madame at the address Ruth provided. Madame invites them inside and listens to their request, after which Miss Emily appears from the next room. Miss Emily says that deferrals do not exist. She explains that Hailsham was part of a progressive movement committed to raising clones more humanely. Madame used to exhibit the students’ artwork to show the outside world that clones had souls. Although the movement once had many supporters, changing public opinion eventually forced Hailsham to close. On the drive back to his recovery center, Tommy asks Kathy to pull over. He walks into the woods and begins screaming. Kathy goes to Tommy and holds him. Soon after, Tommy gives his fourth donation and completes. Kathy drives to a field in Norfolk, where she allows herself to imagine Tommy on the horizon. Then she drives away."
Arrests,"The Other Wes Moore: One Name, Two Fates tells the story of two Black men with the same name: Wes Moore. Both men grew up enduring similar hardships, but Moore, the author and narrator, was encouraged to overcome these difficulties and became successful, while Wes, his counterpart, found himself sentenced to life in prison for murder. Moore learns about Wes and, fascinated, writes him a letter, hoping to find out more about what led Wes to a life of incarceration. Moore receives a response from Wes and begins to visit him in prison, where the two share their stories.
In the first section of the book, the two men discuss the impact that the absence of their fathers had on their lives, and their stories alternate in each chapter. Moore introduces his mother, Joy; father, Westley; and sisters, Nikki and Shani. He details how his parents met and describes his father’s job as a radio journalist. When Moore was three years old, he watched his father become sick and die in front of him. 
Meanwhile, young Wes has never met his father, Bernard, who was an alcoholic, but loved spending time with his father’s mother, Mamie. One day, Wes’s mother, Mary, learns that her funding to go to college has been taken away, and her dream to get her degree crumbles. That night, Mary has plans with friends, so she drops young Wes off at Mamie’s for the night. When Wes arrives at Mamie’s, he sees a drunk man—Bernard—on Mamie’s couch. When Bernard asks Mary who the kid is, Mary introduces Wes to his father.
Several years later, Wes and his friend Woody go the park, where they meet up with a group of boys to play football. The game turns aggressive, and another boy punches Wes. Wes runs home and grabs a knife. He returns to the park and runs after the boy, but the police arrive and arrest Wes. He is eight years old. 
Around this time, Moore’s widowed mother, Joy, unable to raise her children alone any longer, has moved her family to the Bronx to live with her parents. To keep Moore off the street, she sends Moore to Riverdale, a private school. She works three jobs to pay the tuition. Moore feels alienated. He doesn’t fit in at Riverdale, and the neighborhood kids tease him for attending a white school. When Moore’s grades slip, Joy threatens to send him to military school. 
Wes admires and envies his older brother Tony. Tony is very protective of Wes. Tony deals drugs, has a formidable reputation, and always seems to wear expensive, stylish clothes. Hoping to earn money like Tony, Wes becomes a lookout for a local drug dealer. He later starts dealing drugs himself.
In the next section of the book, Moore and Wes discuss maturity and second chances. Once again, their stories alternate in each chapter. At age fifteen, Wes makes his money selling drugs. When Tony asks Wes how he can afford so many pairs of sneakers, Wes lies and says he works as a DJ. Tony knows he’s being dishonest, attacks him, and then tells Mary that Wes sells drugs. Mary finds drugs in Wes’s room and flushes them down the toilet. Wes feels angry about the situation but vows to make up the $4,000 he lost. 
In the Bronx, Moore continues to do poorly in school. The police catch him tagging a building with his friend Shea, who has started running drugs. Shea is obstinate toward the police, but Moore feels terrified. The police let the boys off with a warning. A year later, Moore finds himself on academic probation at Riverdale, so Joy sends him to military school. At first, Moore displays an attitude and defies his commander, Sergeant Anderson. At one point, Anderson gives Moore a map with directions to the nearest bus station, encouraging Moore to leave. The directions are fake, however, and Moore becomes lost in the woods. When Anderson finds Moore in the woods, he brings him to Colonel Batt, who allows Moore to call home for five minutes. The next day, Moore is impressed by the discipline of F Company, and Colonel Batt suggests he talks to its commander, Cadet Captain Ty Hill.
In Maryland, Wes meets Alicia, who quickly becomes pregnant. Wes soon begins dating a new girl, however, and one night, as the girl leaves Wes’s apartment, her boyfriend, Ray, is waiting outside. Ray yells at the girl and attacks Wes, who runs inside and grabs a gun. Wes and some of his crew chase Ray and shoot him. Wes is arrested soon after. He spends six months in juvenile detention for the crime.
Three years later, Wes has dropped out of school and is selling drugs full-time. One day, a suspicious man approaches Wes, asking for drugs. Wes turns the man away at first but then decides to take a chance. However, the man is an undercover cop, and Wes is arrested again. 
Meanwhile, Moore thrives in military school, where he wins academic and athletic scholarships. One day, Moore and a friend walk into town for food. While they are walking, a group of boys in a car accost them, shout racial slurs, and hit Moore in the head with a bottle. Moore and his friend find their way back to campus through the same woods where Moore once got lost. He reflects on how much has changed for him over the past few years.
In the third section of the book, Moore and Wes discuss how other people’s expectations have shaped their lives. While in a plane during his paratrooper training, Moore contemplates how much his life has changed and considers how he now sees every moment of life as precious. 
In Baltimore, Wes, now the father of four, tries to change his life and goes to Job Corps for vocational training. There, he is encouraged by his teachers and peers and finds success. However, after graduating, Wes struggles to pay his bills and turns to selling drugs again.
Three years later, Wes and Tony rob a jewelry store. As they escape, one of them shoots and kills the security guard, Sergeant Prothero. The police find and arrest them in Philadelphia. Tony pleads guilty and receives a life sentence. Wes pleads innocent and goes to trial, where he is convicted and also sentenced to life in prison. 
During this time, Moore works as an intern for Baltimore’s Mayor Schmoke, who encourages Moore to apply for a Rhodes Scholarship. Moore receives a grant and spends a semester in South Africa, where he witnesses true poverty and the impact of apartheid. At the same time, Moore learns how young Black men in South Africa are encouraged and celebrated, rather than feared, and decides to dedicate himself to a life of service."
Accordance,"As a huntress and her family’s primary source of survival, nineteen-year-old Feyre stalks the bleak woods, a little farther from home than usual. Her family was once very wealthy, but they now live in poverty. Feyre’s luck turns when she spots a deer. At the same time, an enormous wolf appears out of nowhere. Feyre wonders if the wolf is a faerie in disguise. She hates faeries for all the harm they have done to humans. Feyre decides to use a precious ash arrow, a surefire method to kill a faerie, just in case. She fires the arrow as the wolf attacks the deer, killing the beast. The next evening, a golden beast bursts through the door of her family’s rundown cottage. The beast reveals that the wolf was indeed a faerie named Andras. The beast demands payment for his death under the terms of the Treaty between the human and faerie realms. The beast gives Feyre a choice: he can kill her now, or she can follow him to the faerie realm of Prythian to live out the rest of her days. Feyre chooses to live. 
In Prythian, Feyre learns the golden beast is a High Fae called Tamlin. He is the High Lord of the Spring Court. Tamlin and all the faeries in his court wear permanent masks on their faces due to an affliction called the blight. At first, Feyre is determined to escape Prythian, but she soon becomes accustomed to her new home. She learns about its history and magic and that much of what she was raised to believe about faeries, including their inability to lie and their aversion to iron, are myths. Feyre develops an affection for Alis, her lady-in-waiting, and Lucien, Tamlin’s best friend. Tamlin encourages her to explore her love for painting and to improve her reading skills. He reveals that he has ensured her family is well cared for in the human realm. Romantic and sexual tension grows between them. Although Feyre finds Prythian beautiful, it is full of dangerous creatures and intrigue. The blight makes life in Prythian increasingly perilous. After a threatening visit from a High Fae named Rhysand, Tamlin believes Feyre is no longer safe in Prythian and decides to send her back to the human realm. The night before she leaves, they make love. Tamlin tells Feyre that he loves her. Though she loves him too, she cannot bring herself to speak the words aloud.  
Feyre returns to the human realm to find that Tamlin was true to his word. Her family is extremely wealthy and well cared for. Her father and sisters have been glamoured, or tricked with faerie magic, and know nothing about faeries or how their wealth was restored. They believe Feyre has been away caring for a sick aunt. Soon, her sister Nesta reveals the glamour did not work on her. After Feyre was taken to Prythian, Nesta searched for her but was unable to cross the wall between the human and faerie realms. Nesta also reveals she is still angry at their father for not trying harder to save their mother’s life. Nesta’s words inspire Feyre to fight harder for Tamlin and she sets off for Prythian to fight the blight alongside him.  
When Feyre arrives at the Spring Court, Tamlin’s manor house is in shambles. Alis is the only one left. Alis reveals that the blight is a euphemism that refers to Amarantha, the High Queen of Prythian. Amarantha is an interloper who took Prythian over by force. She stole the powers of the High Fae and placed a curse on Tamlin that could only be broken by a woman who hated the fae declaring her love for him. Since Feyre never told Tamlin she loved him, the curse remained. The curse prevented the faeries from telling Feyre the truth, so they used the blight to explain their masks and other conflicts. Alis can tell Feyre this because Amarantha has relaxed part of the curse, believing she’s already won, but there is still one aspect of the curse Alis cannot reveal. When Alis explains that Tamlin and Lucien are Amarantha’s captives, Feyre decides to go after them. 
Feyre journeys to Amarantha’s faerie court Under the Mountain, where she becomes a captive as well. Amarantha gives her the chance to save Tamlin by completing three tasks or by solving a riddle. For the first task, Feyre uses her hunting skills to escape a giant worm in a labyrinth. As the faeries place bets and watch in amusement, the only one to bet on Feyre is Rhysand. After, he heals her broken arm. In exchange, Feyre agrees to spend a week every month with him in the Night Court. For the second task, Feyre must successfully solve a puzzle and choose the right lever or she and Lucien will be impaled and crushed. She makes the correct choice with the aid of Rhysand’s voice in her head. In the meantime, Rhysand parades Feyre around as his escort at parties. 
For the third task, Feyre must stab three faeries in the heart with ash wood daggers. Despite her guilt, she knows it’s the only way to break the curse. She stabs the first two faeries, but when the hood is removed from the third one, it is Tamlin. At first, Feyre believes she must kill the man she loves until she remembers two conversations about Tamlin’s heart of stone. She believes this means Tamlin’s heart is literally made of stone so he cannot be harmed by the dagger. Knowing Amarantha wants Tamlin for herself and doesn’t want to see him killed, Feyre plunges the dagger into Tamlin’s chest. She is correct, but Amarantha refuses to break the curse based on a technicality. In a rage, Amarantha beats Feyre almost to death. Feyre finally realizes the answer to Amarantha’s riddle is the word love. She speaks the solution aloud and the curse breaks just as Feyre dies. With the curse broken, Tamlin and Rhysand join forces to destroy Amarantha. One by one, the six High Lords gift Feyre with healing light and immortality. Tamlin sets a bit of this golden light on her heart, resurrecting Feyre and transforming her into one of the High Fae. Feyre and Tamlin are finally free, but Feyre must reckon with her new life and the lives she took to bring them to this point."
Insatiable,"Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy Pevensie are four siblings sent to live in the country with the eccentric Professor Kirke during World War II. The children explore the house on a rainy day and Lucy, the youngest, finds an enormous wardrobe. Lucy steps inside and finds herself in a strange, snowy wood. Lucy encounters the Faun Tumnus, who is surprised to meet a human girl. Tumnus tells Lucy that she has entered Narnia, a different world. Tumnus invites Lucy to tea, and she accepts. Lucy and Tumnus have a wonderful tea, but the faun bursts into tears and confesses that he is a servant of the evil White Witch. The Witch has enchanted Narnia so that it is always winter and never Christmas. Tumnus explains that he has been enlisted to capture human beings. Lucy implores Tumnus to release her, and he agrees.
Lucy exits Narnia and eagerly tells her siblings about her adventure in the wardrobe. They do not believe her, however. Lucy's siblings insist that Lucy was only gone for seconds and not for hours as she claims. When the Pevensie children look in the back of the wardrobe they see that it is an ordinary piece of furniture. Edmund teases Lucy mercilessly about her imaginary country until one day when he sees her vanishing into the wardrobe. Edmund follows Lucy and finds himself in Narnia as well. He does not see Lucy, and instead meets the White Witch that Tumnus told Lucy about. The Witch Witch introduces herself to Edmund as the Queen of Narnia. The Witch feeds Edmund enchanted Turkish Delight, which gives Edmund an insatiable desire for the dessert. The Witch uses Edmund's greed and gluttony to convince Edmund to bring back his siblings to meet her.
On the way back to the lamppost, the border between Narnia and our world, Edmund meets Lucy. Lucy tells Edmund about the White Witch. Edmund denies any connection between the Witch and the Queen. All Edmund can think about is his desire for the Turkish Delight. Lucy and Edmund return to Peter and Susan, back in their own world. Lucy relies on Edmund to support her story about Narnia, but Edmund spitefully tells Peter and Susan that it is a silly story. Peter and Susan are worried that Lucy is insane so they talk to Professor Kirke. The Professor shocks Peter and Susan by arguing that Lucy is telling the truth.
One day the children hide in the wardrobe to avoid the housekeeper and some houseguests. Suddenly all four Pevensie children find themselves in Narnia. Lucy leads them to Tumnus's home, but a note informs them that Tumnus has been arrested on charges of treason. Lucy realized that this means the Witch knows that Tumnus spared Lucy's life, and that the Witch has captured Tumnus. Lucy implores her siblings to help her rescue Tumnus from the Witch. Guided by a friendly robin, the children wander into the woods, and meet Mr. Beaver. Mr. Beaver brings them back to his home, where he explains that the children cannot do anything to save Tumnus. The only thing the children can do is join Mr. Beaver on a journey to see Aslan a lion. Aslan appears to be a king or god figure in Narnia. The children are all pleasantly enchanted by the name Aslan, except for Edmund, who is horrified by the sound of it. Mr. Beaver, Peter, Susan, and Lucy plot to meet Aslan at the Stone Table the following day, but they soon notice that Edmund has disappeared. Meanwhile, Edmund searches for the White Witch to warn her of Aslan's arrival and of the Beavers' plan. The Witch is enraged to hear that Aslan is in Narnia and immediately begins plotting to kill the children. The Witch wants to avoid an ancient prophecy that says that four humans will someday reign over Narnia and overthrow her evil regime.
The children and the Beavers, meanwhile, rush to reach the Stone Table before the Witch. As they travel, wonderful seasonal changes occur. First they meet Santa Claus, or Father Christmas, who explains that the Witch's spell of ""always winter and never Christmas"" has ended. The enchanted winter snow melts and the children see signs of spring. Simultaneously, the Witch drags Edmund toward the Stone Table and treats him very poorly. Once spring arrives, the Witch cannot use her sledge anymore, so she cannot reach the Stone Table before the children.
When the other three Pevensies meet Aslan, they are awed by him, but they quickly grow more comfortable in his presence. They love him immediately, despite their fear. Aslan promises to do all that he can to save Edmund. He takes Peter aside to show him the castle where he will be king. As they are talking, they hear Susan blowing the magic horn that Father Christmas gave her to her, signaling that she is in danger. Aslan sends Peter to help her. Arriving on the scene, Peter sees a wolf attacking Susan, and stabs it to death with the sword given him by Father Christmas. Aslan sees another wolf vanishing into a thicket, and sends his followers to trail it, hoping it will lead them to the Witch.
The Witch is preparing to kill Edmund as the rescue party arrives. Aslan and his followers rescue Edmund, but are unable to find the Witch, who disguises herself as part of the landscape. Edmund is happy to see his siblings, as he has accepted that the Witch is evil. The next day, the Witch and Aslan speak and the Witch demands Edmund's life because she says that Edmund is a traitor. The Witch says that according to the Deep Magic of Narnia, a traitor life's is forfeit to the Witch. Aslan does not deny this, and he secretly reaches a compromise with her. The Witch appears very pleased, while Aslan seems pensive and depressed.
The following night, Susan and Lucy observe Aslan grow increasingly gloomy and sad. The sisters are unable to sleep, and they notice that Aslan has disappeared. Susan and Lucy leave the pavilion to search for Aslan. When they find Aslan, he tells them they can stay until he tells them they must leave. Together, Aslan, Susan, and Lucy walk to the Stone Table, where Aslan tells them to leave. Susan and Lucy hide behind some bushes and watch the Witch and a horde of her followers torment, humiliate, and finally kill Aslan. The Witch explains that Aslan sacrificed his life for Edmund.
Susan and Lucy stay with Aslan's dead body all night. In the morning, they hear a great cracking noise, and are astounded to see the Stone Table broken. Aslan has disappeared. Suddenly Susan and Lucy hear Aslan's voice from behind him. Aslan has risen from the dead. Aslan carries the girls to the Witch's castle, where they free all the prisoners who have been turned to stone. Aslan, Susan, and Lucy charge join the battle between Peter's army and the Witch's troops. Peter and his troops are exhausted. Fortunately, Aslan swiftly kills the Witch and Peter's army then defeats the Witch's followers.
Aslan knights Edmund, who has atoned for his sin of siding with the Witch. The children ascend to the thrones at Cair Paravel, the castle in Narnia. Aslan subsequently disappears. The children eventually become adults and reign over Narnia for many years. One day, in a hunt for a magical white stag, they arrive at the lamppost that had marked the border between Narnia and our world. The Pevensies tumble back out of the wardrobe to our world. No time has passed, and they return to Professor Kirke's house as children. The foursome tells Professor Kirke about their adventure, and the Professor assures them that they will return to Narnia again some day."
Grievances,"Euripedes' Medea opens in a state of conflict. Jason has abandoned his wife, Medea, along with their two children. He hopes to advance his station by remarrying with Glauce, the daughter of Creon, king of Corinth, the Greek city where the play is set. All the events of play proceed out of this initial dilemma, and the involved parties become its central characters.
Outside the royal palace, a nurse laments the events that have lead to the present crisis. After a long series of trials and adventures, which ultimately forced Jason and Medea to seek exile in Corinth, the pair had settled down and established their family, achieving a degree of fame and respectability. Jason's recent abandonment of that family has crushed Medea emotionally, to the degree that she curses her own existence, as well as that of her two children.
Fearing a possible plot of revenge, Creon banishes Medea and her children from the city. After pleading for mercy, Medea is granted one day before she must leave, during which she plans to complete her quest for ""justice""--at this stage in her thinking, the murder of Creon, Glauce, and Jason. Jason accuses Medea of overreacting. By voicing her grievances so publicly, she has endangered her life and that of their children. He claims that his decision to remarry was in everyone's best interest. Medea finds him spineless, and she refuses to accept his token offers of help.
Appearing by chance in Corinth, Aegeus, King of Athens, offers Medea sanctuary in his home city in exchange for her knowledge of certain drugs that can cure his sterility. Now guaranteed an eventual haven in Athens, Medea has cleared all obstacles to completing her revenge, a plan which grows to include the murder of her own children; the pain their loss will cause her does not outweigh the satisfaction she will feel in making Jason suffer.
For the balance of the play, Medea engages in a ruse; she pretends to sympathize with Jason (bringing him into her confidence) and offers his wife ""gifts,"" a coronet and dress. Ostensibly, the gifts are meant to convince Glauce to ask her father to allow the children to stay in Corinth. The coronet and dress are actually poisoned, however, and their delivery causes Glauce's death. Seeing his daughter ravaged by the poison, Creon chooses to die by her side by dramatically embracing her and absorbing the poison himself.
A messenger recounts the gruesome details of these deaths, which Medea absorbs with cool attentiveness. Her earlier state of anxiety, which intensified as she struggled with the decision to commit infanticide, has now given way to an assured determination to fulfill her plans. Against the protests of the chorus, Medea murders her children and flees the scene in a dragon-pulled chariot provided by her grandfather, the Sun-God. Jason is left cursing his lot; his hope of advancing his station by abandoning Medea and marrying Glauce, the conflict which opened the play, has been annihilated, and everything he values has been lost through the deaths that conclude the tragedy."
Thrived,"In Common Sense, Thomas Paine argues for American independence. His argument begins with more general, theoretical reflections about government and religion, then progresses onto the specifics of the colonial situation.
Paine begins by distinguishing between government and society. Society, according to Paine, is everything constructive and good that people join together to accomplish. Government, on the other hand, is an institution whose sole purpose is to protect us from our own vices. Government has its origins in the evil of man and is therefore a necessary evil at best. Paine says that government's sole purpose is to protect life, liberty and property, and that a government should be judged solely on the basis of the extent to which it accomplishes this goal.
Paine then considers an imagined scenario in which a small group of people has been placed on an island, and cut off from the rest of society. In time, these people develop ties with one another, and lawmaking becomes inevitable. Paine says the people will be much happier if they are responsible for the creation of the laws that rule them. Paine is also implicitly arguing that such a system of representation is also better for the American colonists. Having expressed his disagreement with British reign in America, Paine proceeds to launch a general attack on the British system of government. Paine says the British system is too complex and rife with contradictions, and that the monarchy is granted far too much power. The British system pretends to offer a reasonable system of checks and balances, but in fact, it does not.
From here Paine moves on to discuss, in general, the notions of monarchy and hereditary succession. Man, Pain argues, was born into a state of equality, and the distinction that has arisen between king and subject is an unnatural one. At first, Paine says, the world was without kings, but the ancient Jews decided they wanted a king. This angered God, but he allowed them to have one. Paine presents pages of biblical evidence detailing God's wrath at the idea of the Jews having a king. The conclusion Paine reaches is that the practice of monarchy originates from sin, and is an institution that the Bible and God condemn. Paine calls hereditary succession an abominable practice. He says that even if people were to choose to have a king, that does not legitimize that King's child acting as a future ruler. Furthermore, hereditary succession has brought with it innumerable evils, such as incompetent kings, corruption, and civil war.
Having dispensed with the preliminary theoretical issues, Paine sets in to discuss the details of the American situation. In response to the argument that America has flourished under British rule, and therefore ought to stay under the king, Paine says that such an argument fails to realize that America has evolved and no longer needs Britain's help. Some say that Britain has protected America, and therefore deserves allegiance, but Paine responds that Britain has only watched over America in order to secure its own economic well-being. Paine adds that most recently, instead of watching over the colonies, the British have been attacking them, and are therefore undeserving of American loyalty.
Paine says that the colonies have little to gain from remaining attached to Britain. Commerce can be better conducted with the rest of Europe, but only after America becomes independent. Paine also asserts that if the colonies remain attached to Britain, the same problems that have arisen in the past will arise in the future. Paine argues that it is necessary to seek independence now, as to do otherwise would only briefly cover up problems that will surely reemerge.
Paine even proposes the form of government that the independent colonies should adopt. His recommendation is for a representative democracy that gives roughly equal weight to each of the colonies.
Paine explains why the current time is a good time to break free of Britain. Primarily, Paine focuses on the present size of the colonies, and on their current capabilities. He presents an inventory of the British Navy and gives calculations revealing how America could build a navy of comparable size. Paine recommends this as a way of ensuring America's security and prosperity in trade. Paine also argues that America is sufficiently small as to be united now. If time were to elapse, and the population of the colonies to grow, the same feeling of unity would not be present. Paine adds that if the Americans revolt now, they can use the vast expanses of uncharted land to the West in order to pay down some of the debt they will incur.
Paine says that as a colony of Britain, America lacks respectability on the international scene. They are seen simply as rebels, and cannot form substantial alliances with other nations. In order to prosper in the long term, the colonies need to be independent. Paine says that, by declaring independence, America will be able to ask for the help of other countries in its struggle for freedom. For all of these reasons, Paine says it is imperative and urgent that the colonies declare independence."
Impresses,"Speak, by Laurie Halse Anderson, chronicles the struggles of thirteen-year-old Melinda Sordino after she is a raped by at a party the summer before her freshman year of high school by another student. Melinda tells her story in first person narrative. She describes events within the framework of the four marking periods of the school year.
In the opening part of Speak, “First Marking Period,” Melinda begins high school, and we learn that former friends now hate her. She experiences humiliation in the cafeteria and Mr. Neck, a social studies teacher, further embarrasses her by giving her demerits on the first day of school. Ostracized by her former friends, she befriends Heather, a new girl at the school. Heather seeks popularity, and she badgers Melinda to join various clubs. Rachel, Melinda’s ex-best friend, hasn’t tried to find out the truth about what really happened to Melinda that night at the party over the summer.
Melinda describes her classes, activities, and thoughts. Her project in Mr. Freeman’s art class is to create a work of art based on a “tree,” which is the object named on the piece of paper she randomly chooses. In biology, Melinda thinks that David Petrakis, her lab partner, might be cute without the braces. And in algebra, when Mr. Stetman has Rachel come to the board to help Melinda with a problem, Melinda is humiliated. 
Melinda often skips class using stolen late passes and doesn’t complete her homework. She finds refuge at school in a vacant janitor’s closet, which she turns into her “burrow.” At the Homecoming Rally, students bully her for being the one who called the cops that night at the party.
At home, Melinda and her parents communicate with each other by leaving notes on the refrigerator. In her bedroom, she no longer wants to look in the mirror and puts it in the back of her closet. Toward the end of the marking period, Melinda’s parents hear from the school about her missing work, and she remains silent while they berate her for failing. Through it all, Melinda sees “IT” everywhere, the nightmare from which she cannot awaken.
In “Second Marking Period,” school is a grind for Melinda. At her parents’ insistence, she stays after to finish her homework, but she goes to her burrow and naps instead. In social studies, David Petrakis stands up against Mr. Neck’s racist rant about immigration. In biology, she finds that a seed within the apple she has cut is already growing. Heather gives her an early Christmas present, and Melinda decides she’ll give Heather a friendship necklace. 
On Christmas, Melinda nearly tells her parents what happened that night last summer but can’t. Winter break is miserable. Her parents keep her busy working for them, and she is relieved when school starts again. 
In gym class, Melinda impresses the basketball coaches with skills but has no interest in being on the team. She reluctantly helps Heather in her attempts to become an initiated member of a do-good club. And in biology, when she and David dissect a frog, she faints when preparing to slice it open. 
Melinda’s parents receive another call from the guidance counselor about her grades. After their verbal assault, Melinda goes to her room and uses an open paper clip to scrape at her wrist. 
“IT”, who we learn is Andy Evans, harasses Melinda in the cafeteria, and she runs to the bathroom to vomit. She has yet to tell anyone, even the reader, about what happened that summer night.
In “Third Marking Period,” Melinda continues to skip school and avoid Andy Evans. Heather ends their friendship suddenly, and later returns the friendship necklace Melinda had given her for Christmas. No one, Melinda is sure, “would like the inside girl I think I am.” 
The school counselors hold another meeting with Melinda’s parents, who berate and threaten her. She refuses to talk or defend herself. She receives In-School Suspension, and IT is there. He sits next to her and blows in her ear when Mr. Neck isn’t looking. 
In art class, Mr. Freeman gives Melinda a book about Picasso to help her “paralyzed” imagination. Picasso’s art inspires her, and she begins to draw. Mr. Freeman recognizes that she has a lot to say.
Melinda works to meet the expectations set for her. Yet, with “no friends in the known universe,” Melinda sits alone at lunch, wondering if everyone is talking and laughing about her. 
One afternoon, after a basketball game, David Petrakis invites her to his house for pizza to celebrate the team’s one-point win. She declines, torn between getting a life, and the fact that the world is a dangerous place.
At last, Melinda reveals that she was attacked at a party last summer, though she does not use the word “rape.” At this point, we (the readers) are the only ones besides Melinda who know what happened.
In “Fourth Marking Period,” Melinda takes her ex-friend Ivy’s advice and tries drawing a tree instead of carving one from linoleum block. She also learns that Rachel is dating Andy Evans. Compelled to do something, she writes a note to Rachel warning her about Andy. In the note, she admits for the first time (but without divulging her identity), that she was raped. 
Springtime arrives, and Melinda finds solace working in the garden. She and David plan a protest in social studies class over an oral report she is supposed to present, and she stands up to Heather by refusing to help her decorate for the Senior Prom. She writes on a stall in the bathroom, “Guys to Stay Away From: Andy Evans.” Andy Evans continues to bully her. 
Melinda feels compelled to tell Rachel the truth about Andy and what happened that night. But, when Rachel learns that Andy Evans was Melinda’s attacker, she accuses Melinda of being jealous and calls her a “twisted little freak.” Later, Ivy brings Melinda into the bathroom stall. Other girls have added words like “creep” and “bastard” under Andy Evan’s name. Seeing that, Melinda feels like she can fly.
Melinda realizes she doesn’t need her burrow anymore. When she is clearing her items out of the closet, Andy Evans barges in, attacks Melinda, and tries to rape her again. She finds her voice and screams “NNNOOO!!” He does not back off, so Melinda breaks a mirror, takes a shard of glass, and holds it to his neck. “I said no,” she tells him. People who had heard her scream run for help.
With hours left in the school year, Melinda finds herself a sort of hero. She finishes her tree project, receiving an A+ from Mr. Freeman."
Prophets,"The Old Testament is a collection of thirty-nine books about the history and religion of the people of Israel. The authors of these books are unknown, and each book possesses a unique tone, style, and message. Individually, they include stories, laws, and sayings that are intended to function as models of religious and ethical conduct. Together—through hundreds of characters and detailed events—they represent a unified narrative about God and his attempt to relate to humankind by relating to a specific group of people.
The Old Testament contains four main sections: the Pentateuch, the Former Prophets (or Historical Books), the Writings, and the Latter Prophets. This study guide covers books from the first three sections.
The Pentateuch
The Pentateuch comprises the first five books of the Old Testament. It depicts a series of beginnings—the beginning of the world, of humankind, and of God’s promise to the Israelites.
Genesis, the first book, opens with God’s creation of the world. The perfect world falls into evil when humans disobey God, and the human population divides into separate nations and languages. After many generations, God speaks to a man named Abraham. God makes a promise, or covenant, with Abraham to make his descendants into a great nation and to give them a great land. Abraham shows strong faith in God, and God seals his promise with a number of signs and tests. This special covenant with God passes on to Abraham’s son, Isaac, and to his grandson, Jacob. Together, they represent the patriarchs, or fathers, of the Israelite people. Jacob’s twelve sons move to Egypt after the youngest brother, Joseph, miraculously becomes a high official in Egypt.
In the Book of Exodus, the descendants of Jacob’s children have become a vast people, but the Pharaoh of Egypt holds them in slavery. God chooses one man, Moses, to rescue the Israelites. God sends ten plagues to Egypt, and, with miraculous signs and wonders, Moses leads the people out of Egypt and across the Red Sea. They go to Mount Sinai, where God appears in a cloud of thunder over the mountain and affirms to the Israelites the promise he made to Abraham. God commands them to worship only himself, and he gives them various ethical and religious laws.
The books of Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy continue the explanation of God’s religious laws and his promises to the people. The people must keep these laws to enter and enjoy the promised land, toward which they are heading. Despite God’s presence, the Israelites complain and disobey incessantly, inciting God’s wrath. They wander the wilderness for forty years in search of the promised land. These books continue the period of Moses’s legendary leadership and miracles, until his death at the end of Deuteronomy.
The Former Prophets
The Former Prophets, or the Historical Books, cover the history of the Israelites from Moses’s death to the fall of the nation in 587 b.c. In the books of Joshua and Judges, the Israelites successfully conquer the land promised to them by God, but they disobey God by worshipping the deities of the surrounding peoples. Neighboring nations invade and oppress the Israelites. God saves the people of Israel by designating judges, or rulers, to lead the people in warding off their enemies.
The two books of Samuel (First Samuel and Second Samuel) cover the rise of the united kingdom of Israel. Israel’s religious leader, Samuel, appoints a king named Saul. Saul disobeys God, however, and God chooses another man, David, to be Israel’s king. King Saul attempts to kill the young David, but fails. Saul’s death closes the first book. In the second book, David establishes the great kingdom of Israel. He conquers Israel’s surrounding enemies and establishes Jerusalem as the religious and political center of Israel.
The books of Kings (called 1 Kings and 2 Kings) trace the decline of Israel’s success. God blesses David’s son, Solomon, with immense wisdom. As king, Solomon expands Israel into an empire and builds a great temple in Jerusalem. Solomon disobeys God by worshipping other deities, and, at his death, the kingdom splits into a northern kingdom, Israel, and a southern kingdom, Judah. A host of evil kings leads the two kingdoms away from worshipping God. Despite the attempts of the prophets Elijah and Elisha to halt Israel’s wrongdoing, the two kingdoms fall to the Assyrian and Babylonian Empires. Jerusalem is destroyed, and the people are sent into exile.
The Writings
The Writings are placed after the historical books in the Christian Bible. Some of these are narratives covering the time of Israel’s exile in other nations and its eventual return to the homeland. The Book of Esther, for example, tells the story of an unassuming Jewish girl who becomes the queen of Persia and boldly saves the Jewish people from genocide.
Many of the Writings are books of poetry and wisdom, among the most important literature in the Old Testament. The Book of Job is a lengthy dialogue investigating God’s justice and the problem of human suffering. The Psalms are lyrical poems and hymns—many attributed to King David—that express humankind’s longing for God. The books of Proverbs and Ecclesiastes—similarly attributed to the wise King Solomon—offer sayings and instructions about the meaning of life and ethical behavior. Lastly, the Song of Solomon (also attributed to Solomon) is a romantic, lyric dialogue between a young woman and her lover."
Administrations,"In 1998, Barbara Ehrenreich, a journalist and activist then in her late 50s, sets out to document the daily struggles of America’s working poor. Having trained as a biologist, she decides to do fieldwork: in three different U.S. cities, she takes minimum-wage jobs and looks for affordable places to live. She leaves her Ph.D. and most of her skills off of her applications, to ensure that she is given the lowest-level positions available to a white, native-English speaking woman. However, she will use outside cash, if necessary, to ensure that she will never be without a car, she will not have to skip meals to save money, and she will never be homeless.
Ehrenreich’s first experiences are in Key West, Florida. Her most affordable living option, cheaper than a trailer in town, is a shabby efficiency apartment thirty miles away. Although she expects to earn $7 per hour, the first job she lands, as a diner waitress, pays much less, because she will also earn tips. The job requires not only serving tables but also additional work, like cleaning and restocking. Although Ehrenreich gets along well with her coworkers, she struggles as a waitress, because of her lack of experience. Realizing that she will not be able to stay in her apartment on what she is earning, she tries takes a second waitressing job, at another diner. She quickly realizes she will be physically unable to work both jobs, quits the first job, and takes a hotel housekeeping job next door to the second diner, instead. However, when her supervisor at the second diner yells at her, Ehrenreich has had enough and walks out.
Ehrenreich’s next location is Portland, Maine. There, after much searching, she finds a small apartment she will be able to afford. She takes two jobs. The first is with a maid service that cleans the homes of affluent clients where she works on a cleaning team with several other women. The work is back-breaking, and Ehrenreich develops a skin rash of unknown origin. She sees the other women continue to work even when they are injured or feeling sick. She notices that the cleaning techniques the team is taught to use are more about making homes look cleaner than about actually cleaning them. She learns that her employer charges customers $25 per person-hour, while she will earn $6.65 an hour. Ehrenreich’s other job is at a nursing home, where she helps serve food to residents with Alzheimer’s. The interactions with the residents are pleasant, but the cleanup work after meals is overwhelming, partly because one of the automatic dishwashers is broken.
In Minneapolis, Minnesota, finally, Ehrenreich has a very hard time finding safe, sanitary housing she can afford. A charity worker suggests that she check into a shelter while saving up first month’s rent. She has two job applications accepted, but backs out of one job, at a hardware store, when her very first shift is scheduled to last eleven hours without overtime pay. The other job is in women’s clothing at Wal-Mart. The day-long orientation for new employees includes criticism of labor unions, while the pay is less than typical for the area. The store layout is constantly changing, and customers make extra work for her by leaving unbought merchandise in other departments. The job makes Ehrenreich, by her own account, callous and spiteful. Meanwhile, she has been unable to secure a long-term rental situation. Fed up, at one of the employee meetings she starts talking about the need for a union. By now, she has already decided to quit.
Reviewing her experiences in light of the data from many different studies, Ehrenreich comes to several conclusions. She finds that workers cannot support themselves on minimum wage in America unless they work multiple jobs, and only so long as there are no unexpected expenses, such as for medical care. Ehrenreich also finds that employers try to keep information about the wages they pay from becoming general knowledge among workers. Additionally, she finds that the ways in which workers are supervised, including random urine tests for drug use, encourage the workers to accept being dehumanized. Ehrenreich adds that the attitudes found in managers of low-wage employees are based on class or racial prejudice. Finally, she states that medical benefits and child care are too expensive even for middle-class workers, let alone ones on minimum wage. She notes that perhaps someday the working poor will refuse to stop accepting their situation and will demand that things change—and concludes that the country will be a better place when they do."
Throughout,"The protagonist, who is named Tim O’Brien, begins by describing an event that occurred in the middle of his Vietnam experience. “The Things They Carried” catalogs the variety of things his fellow soldiers in the Alpha Company brought on their missions. Several of these things are intangible, including guilt and fear, while others are specific physical objects, including matches, morphine, M-16 rifles, and M&M’s candy.
Throughout the collection, the same characters reappear in various stories. The first member of the Alpha Company to die is Ted Lavender, a “grunt,” or low-ranking soldier, who deals with his anxiety about the war by taking tranquilizers and smoking marijuana. Lavender is shot in the head on his way back from going to the bathroom, and his superior, Lieutenant Jimmy Cross, blames himself for the tragedy. When Lavender is shot, Cross is distracting himself with thoughts of Martha, a college crush. It is revealed in “Love” that Cross’s feelings for Martha, whom he dated once before leaving for Vietnam, were never reciprocated, and that even twenty years after the war, his guilt over Lavender’s death remains.
In “On the Rainy River,” the narrator, O’Brien, explains the series of events that led him to Vietnam in the first place. He receives his draft notice in June of 1968, and his feelings of confusion drive him north to the Canadian border, which he contemplates crossing so that he will not be forced to fight in a war in which he doesn’t believe. Sitting in a rowboat with the proprietor of the Tip Top Lodge, where he stays, O’Brien decides that his guilt about avoiding the war and fear of disappointing his family are more important than his political convictions. He soon leaves, going first back home to Worthington, Minnesota and later to Vietnam.
In addition to Ted Lavender, a few other members of the Alpha Company are killed during their mission overseas, including Curt Lemon, who is killed when he steps on a rigged mortar round. Though O’Brien is not close to Lemon, in “The Dentist,” he tells a story of how Lemon, who faints before a routine checkup with an army-issued dentist, tries to save face by insisting that a perfectly good tooth be pulled. Lee Strunk, another member of the company, dies from injuries he sustains by stepping on a landmine. In “Friends,” O’Brien remembers that before Strunk was fatally hurt, Strunk and Dave Jensen had made a pact that if either man were irreparably harmed, the other man would see that he was quickly killed. However, when Strunk is actually hurt, he begs Jensen to spare him, and Jensen complies. Instead of being upset by the news of his friend’s swift death en route to treatment, Jensen is relieved.
The death that receives the most attention in The Things They Carried is that of Kiowa, a much-loved member of the Alpha Company and one of O’Brien’s closest friends. In “Speaking of Courage,” the story of Kiowa’s death is relayed in retrospect through the memory of Norman Bowker, years after the war. As Bowker drives around a lake in his Iowa hometown, he thinks that he failed to save Kiowa, who was killed when a mortar round hit and caused him to sink headfirst into a marshy field. O’Brien realizes that he has dealt with his guilt over Kiowa’s death differently than Norman Bowker in “Notes.” Just before the end of the war, O’Brien receives a long letter from Bowker that says he hasn’t found a way to make life meaningful after the war. O’Brien resolves to tell Bowker’s story, and the story of Kiowa’s death, in order to negotiate his own feelings of guilt and hollowness.
Like “Love” and “Notes,” several of O’Brien’s stories are told from a perspective twenty years after the Vietnam War, when he is a forty-three-year-old writer living in Massachusetts. Exposure to the guilt of old friends like Jimmy Cross and Norman Bowker prompts him to write stories in order to understand what they were going through. But two stories, “The Man I Killed” and “Ambush,” are written so that O’Brien can confront his own guilt over killing a man with a grenade outside the village of My Khe. In “The Man I Killed,” O’Brien imagines the life of his victim, from his childhood to the way things would have turned out for him had O’Brien not spotted him on a path and thrown a grenade at his feet. In “Ambush,” O’Brien imagines how he might relay the story of the man he killed to his nine-year-old daughter, Kathleen. In this second story, O’Brien provides more details of the actual killing—including the sound of the grenade and his own feelings—and explains that even well after the fact, he hasn’t finished sorting out the experience.
In the last story, “The Lives of the Dead,” O’Brien gives another twist to his contention that stories have the power to save people. In the stories of Curt Lemon and Kiowa, O’Brien explains that his imagination allowed him to grapple successfully with his guilt and confusion over the death of his fourth-grade first love, Linda."
Misfortune,"The full title of Moll Flanders gives an apt summary of the plot: ""The Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Famous Moll Flanders, Etc. Who was born in Newgate, and during a life of continu'd Variety for Threescore Years, besides her Childhood, was Twelve Year a Whore, five times a Wife (whereof once to her own brother), Twelve Year a Thief, Eight Year a Transported Felon in Virginia, at last grew Rich, liv'd Honest and died a Penitent.

Abandoned by her first lover, she is compelled to marry his younger brother. He dies after a few years, and she marries a draper who soon flees the country as a fugitive from the law. She marries yet again and moves to America, only to find out that her husband is actually her half-brother. She leaves him in disgust and returns to England, where she becomes the mistress of a man whose wife has gone insane. He renounces his affair with Moll after a religious experience.
Moll's next marriage offer is from a banker whose wife has been cheating on him. Moll agrees to marry him if he can obtain a divorce, and meanwhile she travels to the country and marries a rich gentleman in Lancashire. This man turns out to be a fraud--he is as poor as she is--and they part ways to seek their fortunes separately. Moll returns to marry the banker, who by this time has succeeded in divorcing his wife. He dies soon after, however, and Moll is thrown back upon her own resources once again. She lives in poverty for several years and then begins stealing. She is quite talented at this new ""trade"" and soon becomes an expert thief and a local legend.

They both manage to have their sentences reduced, and they are transported to the colonies, where they begin a new life as plantation owners. In America, Moll rediscovers her brother and her son and claims the inheritance her mother has left her. Prosperous and repentant, she returns with her husband to England at the age of seventy."
Less,"The convict Jean Valjean is released from a French prison after serving nineteen years for stealing a loaf of bread and for subsequent attempts to escape from prison. When Valjean arrives at the town of Digne, no one is willing to give him shelter because he is an ex-convict. Desperate, Valjean knocks on the door of M. Myriel, the kindly bishop of Digne. Myriel treats Valjean with kindness, and Valjean repays the bishop by stealing his silverware. When the police arrest Valjean, Myriel covers for him, claiming that the silverware was a gift. The authorities release Valjean and Myriel makes him promise to become an honest man. Eager to fulfill his promise, Valjean masks his identity and enters the town of Montreuil-sur-mer. Under the assumed name of Madeleine, Valjean invents an ingenious manufacturing process that brings the town prosperity. He eventually becomes the town’s mayor.
Fantine, a young woman from Montreuil, lives in Paris. She falls in love with Tholomyès, a wealthy student who gets her pregnant and then abandons her. Fantine returns to her home village with her daughter, Cosette. On the way to Montreuil, however, Fantine realizes that she will never be able to find work if the townspeople know that she has an illegitimate child. In the town of Montfermeil, she meets the Thénardiers, a family that runs the local inn. The Thénardiers agree to look after Cosette as long as Fantine sends them a monthly allowance.
In Montreuil, Fantine finds work in Madeleine’s factory. Fantine’s coworkers find out about Cosette, however, and Fantine is fired. The Thénardiers demand more money to support Cosette, and Fantine resorts to prostitution to make ends meet. One night, Javert, Montreuil’s police chief, arrests Fantine. She is to be sent to prison, but Madeleine intervenes. Fantine has fallen ill, and when she longs to see Cosette, Madeleine promises to send for her. First, however, he must contend with Javert, who has discovered Madeleine’s criminal past. Javert tells Madeleine that a man has been accused of being Jean Valjean, and Madeleine confesses his true identity. Javert shows up to arrest Valjean while Valjean is at Fantine’s bedside, and Fantine dies from the shock.
After a few years, Valjean escapes from prison and heads to Montfermeil, where he is able to buy Cosette from the Thénardiers. The Thénardiers turn out to be a family of scoundrels who abuse Cosette while spoiling their own two daughters, Eponine and Azelma. Valjean and Cosette move to a run-down part of Paris. Javert discovers their hideout, however, and they are forced to flee. They find refuge in a convent, where Cosette attends school and Valjean works as a gardener.
Marius Pontmercy is a young man who lives with his wealthy grandfather, M. Gillenormand. Because of political differences within the family, Marius has never met his father, Georges Pontmercy. After his father dies, however, Marius learns more about him and comes to admire his father’s democratic politics. Angry with his grandfather, Marius moves out of Gillenormand’s house and lives as a poor young law student. While in law school, Marius associates with a group of radical students, the Friends of the ABC, who are led by the charismatic Enjolras. One day, Marius sees Cosette at a public park. It is love at first sight, but the protective Valjean does his utmost to prevent Cosette and Marius from ever meeting. Their paths cross once again, however, when Valjean makes a charitable visit to Marius’s poor neighbors, the Jondrettes. The Jondrettes are in fact the Thénardiers, who have lost their inn and moved to Paris under an assumed name. After Valjean leaves, Thénardier announces a plan to rob Valjean when he returns. Alarmed, Marius alerts the local police inspector, who turns out to be Javert. The ambush is foiled and the Thénardiers are arrested, but Valjean escapes before Javert can identify him.
Thénardier’s daughter Eponine, who is in love with Marius, helps Marius discover Cosette’s whereabouts. Marius is finally able to make contact with Cosette, and the two declare their love for each other. Valjean, however, soon shatters their happiness. Worried that he will lose Cosette and unnerved by political unrest in the city, Valjean announces that he and Cosette are moving to England. In desperation, Marius runs to his grandfather, M. Gillenormand, to ask for M. Gillenormand’s permission to marry Cosette. Their meeting ends in a bitter argument. When Marius returns to Cosette, she and Valjean have disappeared. Heartbroken, Marius decides to join his radical student friends, who have started a political uprising. Armed with two pistols, Marius heads for the barricades.
The uprising seems doomed, but Marius and his fellow students nonetheless stand their ground and vow to fight for freedom and democracy. The students discover Javert among their ranks, and, realizing that he is a spy, Enjolras ties him up. As the army launches its first attack against the students, Eponine throws herself in front of a rifle to save Marius’s life. As Eponine dies in Marius’s arms, she hands him a letter from Cosette. Marius quickly scribbles a reply and orders a boy, Gavroche, to deliver it to Cosette.
Valjean manages to intercept the note and sets out to save the life of the man his daughter loves. Valjean arrives at the barricade and volunteers to execute Javert. When alone with Javert, however, Valjean instead secretly lets him go free. As the army storms the barricade, Valjean grabs the wounded Marius and flees through the sewers. When Valjean emerges hours later, Javert immediately arrests him. Valjean pleads with Javert to let him take the dying Marius to Marius’s grandfather. Javert agrees. Javert feels tormented, torn between his duty to his profession and the debt he owes Valjean for saving his life. Ultimately, Javert lets Valjean go and throws himself into the river, where he drowns.
Marius makes a full recovery and is reconciled with Gillenormand, who consents to Marius and Cosette’s marriage. Their wedding is a happy one, marred only when Valjean confesses his criminal past to Marius. Alarmed by this revelation and unaware that it was Valjean who saved his life at the barricades, Marius tries to prevent Cosette from having contact with Valjean. Lonely and depressed, Valjean takes to his bed and awaits his death. Marius eventually finds out from Thénardier that Valjean saved Marius’s life. Ashamed that he mistrusted Valjean, Marius tells Cosette everything that has happened. Marius and Cosette rush to Valjean’s side just in time for a final reconciliation. Happy to be reunited with his adopted daughter, Valjean dies in peace."
Supplying,"Anne’s diary begins on her thirteenth birthday, June 12, 1942, and ends shortly after her fifteenth. At the start of her diary, Anne describes fairly typical girlhood experiences, writing about her friendships with other girls, her crushes on boys, and her academic performance at school. Because anti-Semitic laws forced Jews into separate schools, Anne and her older sister, Margot, attended the Jewish Lyceum in Amsterdam.
	The Franks had moved to the Netherlands in the years leading up to World War II to escape persecution in Germany. After the Germans invaded the Netherlands in 1940, the Franks were forced into hiding. With another family, the van Daans, and an acquaintance, Mr. Dussel, they moved into a small secret annex above Otto Frank’s office where they had stockpiled food and supplies. The employees from Otto’s firm helped hide the Franks and kept them supplied with food, medicine, and information about the outside world.
	The residents of the annex pay close attention to every development of the war by listening to the radio. Some bits of news catch Anne’s attention and make their way into her diary, providing a vivid historical context for her personal thoughts. The adults make optimistic bets about when the war will end, and their mood is severely affected by Allied setbacks or German advances. Amsterdam is devastated by the war during the two years the Franks are in hiding. All of the city’s residents suffer, since food becomes scarce and robberies more frequent.
	Anne often writes about her feelings of isolation and loneliness. She has a tumultuous relationship with the adults in the annex, particularly her mother, whom she considers lacking in love and affection. She adores her father, but she is frequently scolded and criticized by Mr. and Mrs. van Daan and Mr. Dussel. Anne thinks that her sister, Margot, is smart, pretty, and agreeable, but she does not feel close to her and does not write much about her. Anne eventually develops a close friendship with Peter van Daan, the teenage boy in the annex. Mr. Frank does not approve, however, and the intensity of Anne’s infatuation begins to lessen.
	Anne matures considerably throughout the course of her diary entries, moving from detailed accounts of basic activities to deeper, more profound thoughts about humanity and her own personal nature. She finds it difficult to understand why the Jews are being singled out and persecuted. Anne also confronts her own identity. Though she considers herself to be German, her German citizenship has been revoked, and though she calls Holland her home, many of the Dutch have turned against the Jews. Anne feels a tremendous solidarity with her aggrieved people, and yet at the same time she wants to be seen as an individual rather than a member of a persecuted group.
During the two years recorded in her diary, Anne deals with confinement and deprivation, as well as the complicated and difficult issues of growing up in the brutal circumstances of the Holocaust. Her diary describes a struggle to define herself within this climate of oppression. Anne’s diary ends without comment on August 1, 1944, the end of a seemingly normal day that leaves us with the expectation of seeing another entry on the next page. However, the Frank family is betrayed to the Nazis and arrested on August 4, 1944. Anne’s diary, the observations of an imaginative, friendly, sometimes petty, and rather normal teenage girl, comes to an abrupt and silent end. 
Otto Frank is the family’s sole survivor, and he recovers Anne’s diary from Miep. He decides to fulfill Anne’s wishes by publishing the diary. Anne’s diary becomes a condemnation of the unimaginable horror of the Holocaust, and one of the few accounts that describe it from a young person’s perspective.
	Since Anne’s diary is a true personal account of a life in hiding, it is inappropriate to analyze it as a novel or other work of fiction. Parts of the diary were intended for public view, but others clearly were not. To appreciate and interpret the diary, it is necessary to consider its horrible context, World War II and the Holocaust, before any discussion of plot development or thematic content."
Main,"Carol Milford attends Blodgett College in Minneapolis and dreams about settling down in a prairie village and transforming it into a place of beauty. After graduation, she works as a librarian at St. Paul for three years. She meets Dr. Will Kennicott at a friend's house, and he begins courting her. After courting for a year, they marry and move to Kennicott's hometown of Gopher Prairie. Disappointed by her first impression of the Gopher Prairie, Carol finds the town to be ugly and the townspeople to be provincial. The townspeople gossip all the time and are completely uninterested in cultural or social issues. Mrs. Bogart, the Kennicotts' neighbor, proves to be a religious hypocrite who idly gossips about everyone. However, Bea Sorenson arrives in Gopher Prairie on the same day as Carol. Awestruck by the magnificence of the town, which is larger than any she town has ever seen, Bea decides to stay and becomes Carol's maid.
Carol refurbishes Kennicott's old-fashioned house with modern furniture and makes elaborate preparations for a party, a party unlike any party the town has ever seen. However, Carol discovers that the dull townspeople do not like change. Furthermore, she feels disheartened to learn that the townspeople constantly watch her every move and criticize her for being different from them. They criticize the way she dresses and the way she acts. She finds few friends in Gopher Prairie, except for the lawyer, Guy Pollock, and the high school teacher, Vida Sherwin. Carol also becomes friends with her maid, Bea, and the town's handyman, Miles Bjornstam. While the townspeople treat Miles as an outcast because he supports socialism and the Democratic Party, Carol finds herself drawn to him.
Carol tries to get the people to build a new city hall, school, and library, and a more comfortable rest room for the farmer's wives. However, no one shares her interest in constructing new buildings or helping the town's poor. Everyone tells her that they do not want to spend money on unnecessary things like buildings. Carol idealizes Guy Pollock, thinking that he shares her interest in reforming the town. However, she eventually finds out that he does not care for social reform and that he has settled down to enjoy small town life. As Guy explains to Carol, he has the ""Village Virus.""
Carol joins the Jolly Seventeen, the women's social club, and the Thanatopsis Club, the women's study group. When she tries to change the unimaginative club programs, the other members ignore her suggestions. Along with a group of friends, Carol forms a drama group and stages a play, which turns out to be horribly mediocre. Appointed to the library board, she eagerly makes suggestions to how the library could encourage reading, but the local librarian opposes her suggestions, preferring to discourage readers in order to keep the books clean.
Carol and Kennicott have a bitter argument in which he accuses her of feeling superior to everyone else in town. After they make up, she begins to fall in love with him all over again. She idealizes him as a heroic doctor and witnesses him amputating a farmer's arm one night. But life in Gopher Prairie continues to offer Carol no challenges. She gives birth to a boy, whom she names Hugh after her deceased father. Kennicott's aunt and uncle, the Smails, come to live in Gopher Prairie and prove a constant irritation to Carol.
Meanwhile, Bea and Miles Bjornstam marry. The townspeople still shun Bjornstam and do not visit his household. Unfortunately, Bea and her son Olaf die from typhoid. Heartbroken, Bjornstam leaves town, and the townspeople blame him for his family's deaths. Then, Carol's friend Vida Sherwin marries Raymond Wutherspoon, another local. When World War I breaks out, Raymond joins the army. Although Kennicott also wants to enlist, the medical council requests that he stay in Gopher Prairie to provide his services.
Erik Valborg, the son of a Swedish farmer, comes to Gopher Prairie to work as the tailor's assistant. Fern Mullins, a young teacher, also arrives in Gopher Prairie and boards in Mrs. Bogart's house. Carol finds the company of these two new residents stimulating because they share her love for books, music, dance, and drama. Cy Bogart, the leader of the town's gang of boys and Mrs. Bogart's son, ruins Fern's reputation when he falsely accuses Fern of getting him drunk and making sexual advances on him. Forced to resign from the school, Fern leaves Gopher Prairie.
Erik finds himself attracted to Carol and goes out with her for long walks. Kennicott knows about the close relationship between Erik and Carol but does not really mind because he knows that the two are only good friends who share the same intellectual interests. As Carol and Kennicott's marriage deteriorates, he begins an affair with Maud Dryer. However, after Fern leaves town, Kennicott decides that Carol and Erik should stop seeing each other in order to avoid another scandal. Erik leaves Gopher Prairie.
Kennicott then decides to take Carol on a long tour of California in order to get away from the gossips in Gopher Prairie. When they return, Carol feels tired because the hypocrisy and narrow-mindedness of the people of Gopher Prairie has not changed at all. She decides to leave and takes her son, Hugh, with her. Although Kennicott feels distressed when Carol leaves, she assures him that she will return someday. Carol moves to Washington, D.C., where she works for two years. Though she enjoys the beautiful city, she feels lonely in its largely anonymous crowds. Kennicott visits Carol in Washington and begins courting her for the second time. Recognizing her husband's love, Carol decides to return to Gopher Prairie.
Carol's experience in Washington helps her acquire maturity and a new outlook toward life. She determines that she can at least play a small role in changing life in Gopher Prairie. When Carol returns, she accepts the small town and its people as they are. However, she still fights small battles to make the town a better place. She gives birth to a daughter, hoping that the child will continue her fight. In the closing lines of the novel, while Carol talks about her struggle reform Gopher Prairie, Kennicott only half-listens to her and thinks only about the weather."
Background,"“The Yellow Wallpaper” opens with the story’s unnamed narrator, who expresses her thoughts in the form of journal entries, marveling at the grandeur of the house and grounds her husband has taken her to for the summer. She feels, however, that there is “something queer” about the place and explains that her case of “nervous depression” is what prompted their stay there. The narrator complains that her husband John, who is also her doctor, belittles both her illness and, more generally, her perspective. Her treatment, known as the “rest cure,” requires that she refrain from virtually any form of activity, even working and writing. Despite these instructions, she feels that activity, freedom, and interesting work would help her condition and has begun keeping a secret journal in order to “relieve her mind.” The narrator continues her journal entry by describing the house and gardens, both of which are beautiful yet clearly impacted by the estate’s years of emptiness. In the nursery on the top floor, however, she finds the yellow wallpaper, with its strange, formless pattern, to be particularly disturbing.
As the first few weeks of the summer pass, the narrator succeeds at hiding her journal, thus keeping her true thoughts from John. While she longs for more stimulating company and complains about John’s patronizing, controlling ways, she takes a new interest in the oddly-menacing wallpaper. John worries about her fixation, and he refuses to repaper the room so as not to give in to her nervousness. The narrator’s imagination, however, has awakened, and she reflects on her history of having an overactive mind. She goes on to describe the bedroom again, which she says must have been a nursery for young children due to the fact that the paper is torn off the wall in spots, there are scratches and gouges in the floor, and the furniture is heavy and fixed in place. Just as she begins to see a strange sub-pattern behind the main design of the wallpaper, John’s sister Jennie, who serves as a housekeeper and nurse for the narrator, interrupts her writing. 
As the Fourth of July passes, the narrator reports that her family has just visited, leaving her more tired than ever. John threatens to send her to Weir Mitchell, the real-life physician under whose care author Charlotte Perkins Gilman suffered. The narrator is alone most of the time and says that she has become almost fond of the wallpaper; studying the pattern has become her primary form of entertainment. As her obsession grows, the sub-pattern of the wallpaper becomes clearer. It begins to resemble a woman “stooping down and creeping” behind the main pattern, which at nighttime looks like the bars of a cage. Soon the wallpaper dominates the narrator’s imagination. Mistaking the narrator’s fixation for tranquility, John thinks she is improving. On the contrary, she sleeps less and less and believes that she can smell the paper all over the house. The sub-pattern now clearly resembles a woman who is trying to escape from behind the main pattern. The narrator sees her shaking the bars at night and creeping around during the day, when the woman is able to leave the wall. 
Suspecting that John and Jennie know of her obsession, she resolves to destroy the paper once and for all, peeling much of it off during the night. While left alone the next day, she goes into something of a frenzy, biting and tearing at the paper in order to free the trapped woman whom she sees struggling from inside the pattern. By the end, the narrator is hopelessly insane, convinced that there are many women creeping around and that she herself has come out of the wallpaper. She creeps endlessly around the room, smudging the wallpaper as she goes. When John breaks into the locked room and sees the full horror of the situation, he faints in the doorway so that the narrator has “to creep over him every time!”"
Further,"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time takes place in the year 1998 in and around the town of Swindon, England. The fifteen-year-old narrator of the story, Christopher John Francis Boone, discovers the slain body of his neighbor’s poodle, Wellington, on the neighbor’s front lawn one evening and sets out to uncover the murderer. His investigation is at times aided, and at other times hampered, by the mild form of autism he lives with. After Christopher hits a policeman in a misunderstanding at the scene of the crime, the police take Christopher into custody. They release Christopher with only a stern warning, under the condition that he promises to them and to his father not to look into the murder any further.
Christopher chronicles his investigation in a book—the book we are reading—as part of a school assignment. Ignoring repeated warnings from his father, Christopher investigates the crime scene and conducts interviews with the residents of his block. He uncovers a more tangled plot than was first apparent when he discovers that his father and the owner of the slain dog, Mrs. Shears, had a romantic affair. He subsequently learns that their affair began in reaction to another relationship, one carried on between Mr. Shears and Christopher’s mother, before she disappeared from Christopher’s life.
At school, Christopher prepares for an A-level math exam that will enable him to attend a university, a feat no other child at his school has managed. He also continues to work on his book. Upon returning home one afternoon, Christopher accidentally leaves his book in plain view on the kitchen table. His father reads it, becomes angry, and confiscates it. Later, Christopher searches for the book and uncovers a series of letters, hidden in a shirt box in his father’s closet, addressed to him from his supposedly dead mother. The letters chronicle a life that his mother has continued to lead with Mr. Shears in London and contain repeated requests for Christopher to respond. In shock, Christopher passes out in his bedroom surrounded by the evidence of his father’s deception. When Father comes home and realizes what has happened, he breaks down in tears. He apologizes for his lies, explaining that he acted out of a desire to protect Christopher from the knowledge of his mother’s abandonment of the family. Christopher’s father also admits to killing Wellington after an argument with Mrs. Shears, his lover.
Christopher, now terrified of his father and feeling he can no longer trust him, sneaks out of the house and travels to London to live with his mother. During a harrowing journey, he copes with and overcomes the social fears and limitations of his condition, dodges police, and almost gets hit by a train. His arrival at his mother’s flat comes as a total surprise to her, as she had no idea that Christopher’s father had been withholding her letters. Christopher settles in for a time at his mother and Mr. Shears’s flat, but friction caused by his presence shortly results in his mother’s decision to leave Mr. Shears to return to Swindon. Christopher moves into a new apartment with his mother and begins to receive regular visits from his father. When Christopher’s pet rat Toby dies, Christopher’s father gives Christopher a puppy. At school, Christopher sits for his A-level math exam and receives an A grade, the best possible score. The novel ends with Christopher planning to take more A-level exams in physics and further math, and then attend a university in another town. He knows that he can do all of this because he solved the mystery of Wellington’s murder, was brave enough to find his mother, and wrote the book that we have read."
Attendant,"The Assistant tells the story of an immigrant grocer, Morris Bober, who lives and works in Brooklyn, New York. Bober emigrated from Russia in his teenage years and met his wife Ida in New York. Their grocery recently has fallen on hard times because a new store has opened across the street and is taking their customers. To stay afloat, the Bobers also rely upon the wages of their daughter, Helen who works as a secretary.
On the opening day of the novel, two men rob Morris's grocery and knock him unconscious with a blow to the head. Following his injury, a man named Frank Alpine arrives in the neighborhood. Frank has come from a rough life in the West to start again. When Morris re-opens the store, Frank appears each morning to help him drag in the heavy milk crates. Eventually, Frank asks if Morris would let Frank work for free so that Frank could learn the trade. Morris says no and Frank disappears. Soon after Morris observes that a quart of milk and two rolls are stolen from his deliveries each morning. After a week, Morris alerts the police because he cannot find the culprit. On the next day, Morris finds Frank Alpine sleeping in his cellar. Frank admits to stealing the milk and bread out of hunger. Morris feeds Frank and lets him sleep in the grocery for the night. The next morning, Morris slips while dragging in the milk and passes out. Frank rescues him then puts on the grocer's apron and starts working in the store.
During the two weeks that Morris recovers, Frank manages to bring in much more money than Morris had done. When Morris returns, Frank moves upstairs to a small room off an apartment that an Italian couple, the Fusos, rent. Because business is so successful, Morris eventually wants to pay Frank. Frank feels guilty about being paid because unknown to the grocer, Frank has been stealing money. Furthermore, it was he and Ward Minogue, a boy whose father is a local detective, who had robbed the grocery.
Frank becomes interested in Helen Bober. Helen recently lost her virginity to Nat Pearl a local Jewish boy whose parents own a candy store and who is attending Law School, but she shunned him after learning that he only wanted sex. The other local Jewish boy on the street, Louis Karp, suggests that Helen marry him, but she is not interested. Frank courts Helen by meeting her at the library, which she visits twice a week. Eventually, they start spending a lot of time together and even kiss. When Frank suggests that they touch more, Helen tells him that she cannot have sex with someone unless she is sure that she loves him. Frank tries to control his urges.
Morris Bober enjoys working with Frank and the two men tell stories to each other during the day. One day, Morris starts to suspect Frank of stealing because revenues do not equal what Morris thinks that they should be. He starts watching Frank closely. Frank, at the same time, is overcome by his guilty conscience and decides to repay all the money he has stolen. He places six dollars back in the register one day, but when he realizes that he will need some money for that night, he steals a dollar back. Morris catches him and is heartbroken. Still, he orders Frank to leave.
The same night, Helen goes to meet Frank late in the park. She has decided that she loves him and will have sex with him. When she gets to the park, a drunk Ward Minogue, whom she knows from primary school, tries to rape her. Frank appears and rescues her, but proceeds to rape her himself.
The following day, Morris Bober falls asleep in his apartment with the radiator unlit, flooding his rooms with gas and almost killing himself. Frank and Nick Fuso save him. Morris contracts pneumonia and has to go to the hospital. Frank keeps the store open for the weeks when Morris is sick. Business is terrible because two Norwegians have just reopened the competing grocery and all the customers have gone there. Frank gives all of his personal savings to the grocery and works all night long at a different job to keep it afloat. Still, when Morris returns to the shop he makes Frank leave. Morris himself then tries to save the business by finding another job, but he cannot. A mysterious man appears one night offering to burn the store down so that Morris can collect the insurance money, but Morris turns him down. Later Morris tries to light such a fire himself, but nearly burns himself to death before Frank appears and rescues him. Morris again orders Frank out.
One night, Ward Minogue, who has been diagnosed with diabetes and who is acting desperately, sneaks into the Karp's liquor store through a broken back window. After getting drunk, Ward accidentally sets the store on fire. Karp's store and building are ruined. The next day, Karp, who has insurance, offers to buy Morris's store and grocery so that he can reopen. Morris feels happy and goes out to shovel snow for the pedestrians, although he fails to wear his coat. Later that night, he falls sick and dies three days later from pneumonia.
After Morris's death, Frank Alpine starts running the store. He works all night at a different job and tries everything to make the store work, but times are tough. Still, he decides that he wants to pay for Helen to attend college. At the end of the book, Helen has become friendlier to Frank and seems ready to accept his offer of tuition. Frank himself has changed utterly becoming completely honest and very much like Morris Bober, whose store and philosophies he now embraces. In his final act, Frank Alpine goes to the hospital, has himself circumcised and after Passover becomes a Jew."
Vulnerable,"Lawyer Bryan Stevenson gives a first-person account of his decades helping marginalized Americans who have been unfairly and harshly punished by the U.S. criminal justice system, which disproportionately targets people of color and poor people. At the heart of Just Mercy is the story of Walter McMillian, a Black man who was framed for the murder of a girl named Ronda Morrison, convicted, and sent to death row. 
Stevenson alternates chapters about Walter with his personal reflections on our country’s history with racial disparity and issues around incarceration. Stevenson highlights other groups of vulnerable people who have been victimized by the criminal justice system and shares the stories of the prisoners he has helped over the years. The book also follows the growth of Stevenson’s nonprofit law project, the Alabama-based Equal Justice Initiative (EJI), through its expansion from focusing on death row prisoners to helping people sentenced to life without parole. Stevenson chronicles how EJI becomes a significant force in criminal justice reform.
In 1983 as a law student, Stevenson discovers his life’s passion when he interns with the Georgia-based Southern Prisoners Defense Committee and meets his first death row prisoner. After graduation Stevenson accepts a job with the organization to represent poor prisoners, including those in Alabama who lack any public defender. He meets Walter McMillian on Alabama’s death row. Walter owns a successful business but also transgresses racial boundaries when he has an affair with a white woman. Soon after the affair becomes public, the woman’s friend, Ralph Myers, accuses Walter of committing the unsolved murder of Ronda Morrison, which has outraged the community. Law enforcement, including a racist sheriff and the district attorney, eagerly pounces on this accusation, overlooking Walter’s alibi and a lack of evidence. Instead, they actively force Ralph to stick with his story even when he tries to recant. They coerce other false witness testimonies, and—as revealed years later—actively suppress evidence.
After Stevenson and the team at EJI unsuccessfully appeal Walter’s conviction, they launch their own investigation of the crime and uncover new evidence. They find witnesses who can prove the witnesses against Walter lied as well as financial records that indicate that one of these witnesses was paid to give false testimony. Stevenson and his team also petition for and receive all records from Walter’s trial. However, their big break comes when they receive a phone call from Ralph, who now wants to make amends. Ralph admits to lying about Walter and says he was threatened by law enforcement. Stevenson wins a hearing for Walter where he can present his new evidence: Ralph’s testimony, which is confirmed by health care workers and other inmates, as well as recordings of the law enforcement team threatening Ralph if he doesn’t frame Walter. 
While the judge refuses to grant Walter relief, Stevenson continues the appeal process through the Alabama courts. The district attorney asks outside agents to investigate the murder for which Walter was convicted, and the investigators determine that Walter had nothing to do with the crime. Six weeks later, the court invalidates Walter’s conviction. Stevenson and the State file a joint motion to dismiss the charges, and Walter is set free.
Throughout the process, Stevenson and Walter become close friends, and Stevenson helps Walter upon his release, including filing a civil suit on his behalf and offering him a place to stay. Walter works with Stevenson to share his story, giving interviews and speaking at legal conferences, and Walter is even featured in a documentary. Unfortunately, Walter is diagnosed with advancing dementia and is forced to rely on family and eventually a nursing facility for his care. He dies in 2013. Stevenson gives a eulogy at his funeral and shares all he learned from Walter, particularly that we must extend mercy to everyone, even those who have not earned it.
Interspersed with chapters chronicling Walter’s narrative are stories of Stevenson’s other clients and work. His closeness with these prisoners and their horrifying circumstances makes Stevenson more determined to help and causes him to reflect on abstract issues that nevertheless imbue the criminal justice system, like humanity and mercy. Stevenson focuses on several categories of vulnerable people who become trapped in the system, including mentally ill prisoners, disabled prisoners, and poor women who give birth to stillborn babies. 
Stevenson and his team at EJI also become increasingly focused on juvenile offenders who are sometimes tried as adults despite their young age. These offenders may be given de facto death sentences by being sentenced to life without parole and face perilous circumstances when they are housed in adult prisons. Stevenson illustrates how these prisoners retain their own humanity while being forced to live under inhumane conditions. He also discusses some of the qualities common among these types of prisoners: They are generally poor and disproportionately people of color, and most of them lack adequate legal counsel. The juveniles have horrific backgrounds of abuse and neglect.
Stevenson and his team at EJI also work to change the legal system to offer more protection to marginalized people. Several of his cases end up before the U.S. Supreme Court, and he succeeds in winning rulings that ban as unconstitutional the conviction of children to life without parole and the execution of people deemed incompetent from dementia or neurological disease. EJI works to raise public awareness of issues surrounding unfair incarceration, produces groundbreaking reports on racial issues, and sets up programs to help formerly incarcerated people adjust to life on the outside.
Stevenson also reflects on the issues that surround the criminal justice system. His time spent with prisoners awaiting their execution makes him realize how inhumane it is to prepare another human to die. After decades of work, when Stevenson fails to prevent the execution of a man who suffers from an intellectual disability, he momentarily feels unable to continue his work. However, he realizes that he cannot help but be broken by his experiences and comes to understand that it is his own brokenness that allows him to more fully understand the need for mercy and to bring compassion to others. The book ends with Stevenson’s renewed commitment to helping others."
Haunt,"Hoping to cause a sensation in the field of parapsychology, Dr. John Montague rents Hill House, a secluded manor with a reputation for being haunted. He carefully selects two participants for his study—Eleanor Vance, a thirty-two-year-old woman who was reported to have had experiences with a poltergeist as a child, and Theodora, a woman marked in one of his lab’s studies as having psychic abilities. A third participant, Luke Sanderson, also joins the group. Luke stands to inherit Hill House after his aunt dies, and Luke’s aunt sends him to watch over the house and deter amateur ghost hunters. She also wants to keep Luke out of trouble since he is a liar and a thief.
Eleanor arrives at Hill House first. An instinct tells her to leave, but she stays and meets the house’s caretakers, Mr. and Mrs. Dudley. They are unwelcoming and urge her to go away, saying that they refuse to stay at the house after dark. Theodora arrives next, and Eleanor, a recluse, feels immediately drawn to Theodora’s warm, witty, and open personality. Eleanor lies and tells Theodora she has an apartment back home, when she actually lives at her sister’s house, where she sleeps on a cot. Eleanor was her mother’s primary caretaker up until her mother’s death a few months prior. She is just beginning to explore her freedom and is elated to have found a new friend.
Dr. Montague and Luke arrive next. Dr. Montague reluctantly tells the group about the house’s history after dinner—he doesn’t want to scare anyone into leaving, since the last tenant to leave at night died when his horse crushed him against the oak tree in the driveway. Dr. Montague explains that the house was built eighty years ago by a man named Hugh Crain. Crain designed Hill House as a series of cloistered, maze-like concentric circles that are almost impossible to navigate. Tragically, Crain’s wife never set foot into the house; she died when her carriage overturned in the driveway. Bitter and depressed, Crain stayed to raise his two daughters in the house. Over the years, the daughters fought over ownership of the house, and the house eventually landed in the hands of the older sister’s caretaker, a young woman from town. Taunted and harassed by the younger sister and the townspeople, the young woman hanged herself, reportedly in the house’s turret.
Over the first week of their stay, the group experiences a series of unexplainable events. One night, the women hear a loud banging on the door and feel a chilling breeze. The men see a mysterious animal run down the hallway. Outside the nursery, they discover a mysterious cold spot. Inside the library, Eleanor detects an awful odor. Finally, Luke discovers the words HELP ELEANOR COME HOME written in chalk in the halls. With each event, the group grows more suspicious of Eleanor, and Eleanor is terrified by the thought that the house is singling her out.
The odd events continue. When Theodora finds the words HELP ELEANOR COME HOME ELEANOR written in blood on her walls, she lashes out at Eleanor, who she suspects is doing these things to get attention. Meanwhile, Eleanor feels herself losing grasp of her senses and at the same time becoming more connected to Theodora. At one point, Dr. Montague assures everyone that ghosts can’t cause them physical harm—only fear can do that. Still, Theodora and Eleanor continue to experience strange events that are hard to recall yet hard to deny.
Mrs. Montague, a parapsychologist, arrives at Hill House with her friend, Arthur. Belittling her husband and his lack of progress, she confidently declares that she will draw out Hill House’s spirits. Mrs. Montague believes that spirits feel lonely and want to connect, but they need to be coaxed into communicating. To accomplish this, she uses a device called a planchette. Mrs. Montague reports that a spirit named “Nell” spoke to her, saying it wanted to go home. The group, deeply disturbed, continues to watch Eleanor with suspicion while growing more fearful of the house. That night, Dr. Montague, Luke, Theodora, and Eleanor stay in a room together to keep watch. They hear terrible banging sounds on the door while Mrs. Montague and Arthur sleep in nearby rooms, undisturbed.
Eleanor realizes that she can hear any sound that occurs inside the house, no matter which room she is in. She believes that she is merging with the house and can sense things that the others can’t. Eleanor wakes up one night and goes to the library, aware that she’s not acting entirely of her own volition. She hears a voice that sounds like her mother’s and chases it throughout the house. Trying to avoid the others, who now realize that she’s roaming the house alone, Eleanor retreats back to the library and climbs a rickety iron stairway to the turret. The others gather underneath it and worry that the stairway will collapse, but Luke climbs up and ushers Eleanor back down to safety.
The next morning, the group agrees that Eleanor must leave Hill House. Eleanor cries and says she has nowhere to go, claiming that Hill House is now her home. Dr. Montague, worried for Eleanor’s sanity, says she must leave at once. Eleanor finally agrees, and the group watches as she begins to drive down the driveway. As she departs, however, Eleanor pities the group for believing that they can thwart Hill House’s desire to keep her—she believes that she belongs to the house. She accelerates toward the oak tree, and right before she crashes and dies, she wonders why she is doing this and why no one is stopping her. After Eleanor’s suicide, the group leaves Hill House. Dr. Montague later publishes his study, but his colleagues ridicule his findings."
Readjustment,"In Persepolis 2: The Story of a Return, Marjane Satrapi resumes the autobiographical account of her life that she began in Persepolis: The Story of a Childhood. The earlier book ended in 1984 with fourteen-year-old “Marji” tearfully saying goodbye to her mother and father at the Tehran airport after her parents decided it would be safer for her go to school in Vienna than to remain in Iran and live under a repressive regime while the country engaged in a bitter war with Iraq.  As Persepolis 2 begins, Marji is in Vienna preparing to enter a French-language school to resume her studies, but she is not living with the émigré family of her mother’s best friend, Zozo, as was planned. Zozo didn’t want Marji living with her family, so she quickly moved Marji to a boarding house run by Catholic nuns, where Marji knows no one and feels very alone.
Marji’s displacement to a boarding house is just the first of many challenges that strong-spirited but vulnerable Marji will face in Vienna over the next four years as she navigates being a teen-aged refugee adjusting from traditionalist Iran to the very Western city of Vienna. In the second half of Persepolis 2, Marji will return to Tehran and face the reverse challenge: she will try to readjust to life back in Iran after four formative years in Vienna. These dual challenges will take a heavy toll on Marji’s psyche as well as severely test, strain, and in some cases destroy her relationships with her family and friends—including her parents, her grandmother, fellow students, childhood acquaintances, boyfriends, and her fiancé and eventual husband. As Marji puts it: “I was a Westerner in Iran, an Iranian in the West. I had no identity. I didn’t even know why I was living.”
Marji’s stay at the Viennese boarding house gets off to a mixed start. Her roommate, Lucia, is a friendly girl from the Tyrol region of Austria, but communication is an issue since Marji and Lucia don’t share a common language and because Lucia is somewhat oblivious to Marji’s sensitivities. Her sensitivities are tested by the communal living arrangements, which Marji has trouble adjusting to after her comfortable home life with her well-off parents. But Lucia comes to Marji’s rescue when she invites her to spend Christmas break with her hospitable family in Tyrol. During the next school break, Marji stays at the boarding house and has a run-in with the mother superior that results in Marji getting kicked out. The mother superior insults Marji’s Iranian heritage, and Marji responds with an insult questioning the nuns’ virtue. 
At school, Marji experiences ups and downs as well. After being ignored by the other students, Marji gains some popularity with her mathematical and tutoring abilities. Her artistic talents also garner attention when she draws caricatures of the teachers. But it’s Marji’s status as a refugee who has “known war” that attracts a set of friends who give Marji her first taste of belonging in Vienna. The group is led by an older French girl named Julie, and its most conspicuous member is a mildly obnoxious punk boy named Momo who Marji tolerates through gritted teeth as he spouts pseudo-intellectual ideas.
After Marji is evicted by the nuns, Julie and her mother Armelle invite her to live with them and share Julie’s bedroom. Marji, who comes from a society that reveres parents, and who deeply misses her own mother, is shocked to see Julie ignore and disrespect Armelle. Marji spends time with Armelle and likes her, especially when she learns that Armelle knows Iranian culture, which is rare among Westerners. Julie’s worldliness (she’s sexually active and takes birth control pills) has a big impact on Marji, who envies and judges Julie simultaneously. While Armelle is traveling, Julie throws a party that is unlike any Marji has ever seen. Rather than eating or talking, the guests smoke and make out. When one guest stays and has sex with Julie, an astonished Marji calls it her first step into being assimilated into Western culture. 
Under her friend’s influence, Marji increasingly adopts the ways of Western youth and culture and worries that she’s losing her Iranian identity. At the same time, Marji undergoes significant physical changes in a growth spurt. She changes her hair, make-up, and clothes style as well. Trying to fit in, Marji now smokes and does drugs. When Julie and Armelle move away from Vienna, Marji sublets a room in a house. During that time, the now sixteen-year-old Marji is visited by her mother. Marji, who now towers over her mother, limits what she tells her mother about her life in Vienna, and her mother doesn’t divulge much about what her family’s life is like back in Iran either. The visit gives Marji a much-needed boost that at least temporarily forestalls more emotional spiraling. 
Marji takes a room in the home of a “Frau Doctor Heller,” a horrible person who adds stress to Marji’s life. Marji finds some solace in being with her boyfriend, a student named Markus. They will date for two years, but it’s never the idyllic relationship Marji wants. After Markus’s mother insults Marji by saying that she’s using him to get a passport, and then cuts off Markus’s allowance, Marji has to finance their dates. Marji also buys the drugs they smoke together, an arrangement that leads to Marji buying and then reselling drugs to other students at their school. Still, Marji grows increasingly dependent on Marcus for emotional support. Marji’s drug dealing ends when the school principal threatens her with expulsion. Her relationship with Markus also ends abruptly when she finds him in bed with another girl.
At this moment of extreme emotional vulnerability, and with right-wing, anti-immigrant sentiments on the rise in Austria, Marji’s landlady accuses her of theft. Marji storms out and spends the next two months on the streets until she ends up in a hospital. Soon after, her parents call and arrange for her to come back to Iran. Marji puts on a veil for the first time in four years and heads to the airport.
When Marji returns to Iran in 1988, the long war with Iraq has ended, but the fundamentalist Islamic regime continues to oppress Iranians with strict social and religious rules and severe punishments. Still recovering from her breakdown in Vienna, Marji tries to recede into the shadows, but her parents, family, and old friends won’t allow it, and Marji is gradually coaxed back into social interactions. Marji’s relationship with her parents has matured, but she still relies on them for advice and for emotional and financial support. Marji’s close relationship with her grandmother resumes, although there is a period when her grandmother won’t speak to her after Marji commits a selfish act that offends her.
Marji won’t mention her problems in Vienna since she feels deep guilt over having fled Iran while others faced the war and other difficulties. Marji feels that her problems in Vienna were inconsequential in comparison. Marji is keenly aware that Iran changed for the worse while she was away. Reminders of the war are everywhere, and the people are now too tired and fearful to stand up to the authorities. Women have it particularly bad in male-dominated Iran, and Marji has difficulty tolerating her old friends who seem vapid and obsessed with Western superficialities, at least in private. Publicly, women are obliged to hide themselves both physically (behind the veil) and intellectually.
Marji’s mother persuades her to seek the help of a psychoanalyst, and Marji tries several before one suggests that she take medication to combat her depression. The anti-depressants make her feel more hopeless, and Marji attempts suicide by swallowing a lot of pills. When Marji unexpectedly survives, she decides it’s a sign that she needs to make big changes in her life, so she alters her look, takes up aerobics, and feels vital for the first time in years. She goes to a party where she meets Reza, an ex-soldier who is now an artist. They’ll eventually marry, but first they decide to go back to school. 
Like all institutions in Iran, the art school that Marji and Reza attend is tightly controlled by the regime. Over time, the couple become part of a faction of students that react to the repression by violating rules on social behavior in private places—particularly by holding alcohol-fueled parties at each other’s homes. The parties are sometimes raided, resulting in arrests and stiff fines that the students’ parents must pay. When a friend of Marji and Reza’s dies in a fall while fleeing the authorities after a raid, Reza vows to stop going to parties, but Marji decides to party more.  Marji and Reza haven’t ever been a very compatible couple, and they argue endlessly. For a while, Marji chooses to celebrate their differences as opposites attracting, but their rifts only increase over time.
In spite of their disagreements, when Reza proposes to Marji she accepts. Marji’s father supports this arrangement even though he believes they aren’t compatible, since he knows that living together is the only way couples can get to know each other in their repressive society. Marji’s parents throw a huge wedding for their only daughter, but when Marji and Reza continue to disagree, Marji realizes their marriage is probably doomed. They stay married, although unhappily and with separate bedrooms, as they continue at school. Toward the end of their four-year program, Marji and Reza are assigned to work together on the final project. For seven months they happily collaborate without arguing on an ambitious theme park plan for Tehran based on figures from Persian mythology. Once the plan is completed and earns them perfect scores, Marji tries to make the plan a reality. But the authorities reject the plan because it is Persian, not Islamic. Marji realizes that she and Reza must divorce, and she must leave Iran.
Marji informs her parents, and they agree. Her father reflects by saying that as Iranians they are crushed, “not only by the government, but by the weight of our own traditions.” Marji is accepted into an arts program in Strasbourg, France, then must wait three months for a student visa. She cherishes her final months with her mother, father, and grandmother in the country that she instinctively loves but cannot remain in. This story ends like the prior book, with Marji at the Tehran airport saying goodbye to her family."
Society,"In Common Sense, Thomas Paine argues for American independence. His argument begins with more general, theoretical reflections about government and religion, then progresses onto the specifics of the colonial situation.
Paine begins by distinguishing between government and society. Society, according to Paine, is everything constructive and good that people join together to accomplish. Government, on the other hand, is an institution whose sole purpose is to protect us from our own vices. Government has its origins in the evil of man and is therefore a necessary evil at best. Paine says that government's sole purpose is to protect life, liberty and property, and that a government should be judged solely on the basis of the extent to which it accomplishes this goal.
Paine then considers an imagined scenario in which a small group of people has been placed on an island, and cut off from the rest of society. In time, these people develop ties with one another, and lawmaking becomes inevitable. Paine says the people will be much happier if they are responsible for the creation of the laws that rule them. Paine is also implicitly arguing that such a system of representation is also better for the American colonists. Having expressed his disagreement with British reign in America, Paine proceeds to launch a general attack on the British system of government. Paine says the British system is too complex and rife with contradictions, and that the monarchy is granted far too much power. The British system pretends to offer a reasonable system of checks and balances, but in fact, it does not.
From here Paine moves on to discuss, in general, the notions of monarchy and hereditary succession. Man, Pain argues, was born into a state of equality, and the distinction that has arisen between king and subject is an unnatural one. At first, Paine says, the world was without kings, but the ancient Jews decided they wanted a king. This angered God, but he allowed them to have one. Paine presents pages of biblical evidence detailing God's wrath at the idea of the Jews having a king. The conclusion Paine reaches is that the practice of monarchy originates from sin, and is an institution that the Bible and God condemn. Paine calls hereditary succession an abominable practice. He says that even if people were to choose to have a king, that does not legitimize that King's child acting as a future ruler. Furthermore, hereditary succession has brought with it innumerable evils, such as incompetent kings, corruption, and civil war.
Having dispensed with the preliminary theoretical issues, Paine sets in to discuss the details of the American situation. In response to the argument that America has flourished under British rule, and therefore ought to stay under the king, Paine says that such an argument fails to realize that America has evolved and no longer needs Britain's help. Some say that Britain has protected America, and therefore deserves allegiance, but Paine responds that Britain has only watched over America in order to secure its own economic well-being. Paine adds that most recently, instead of watching over the colonies, the British have been attacking them, and are therefore undeserving of American loyalty.
Paine says that the colonies have little to gain from remaining attached to Britain. Commerce can be better conducted with the rest of Europe, but only after America becomes independent. Paine also asserts that if the colonies remain attached to Britain, the same problems that have arisen in the past will arise in the future. Paine argues that it is necessary to seek independence now, as to do otherwise would only briefly cover up problems that will surely reemerge.
Paine even proposes the form of government that the independent colonies should adopt. His recommendation is for a representative democracy that gives roughly equal weight to each of the colonies.
Paine explains why the current time is a good time to break free of Britain. Primarily, Paine focuses on the present size of the colonies, and on their current capabilities. He presents an inventory of the British Navy and gives calculations revealing how America could build a navy of comparable size. Paine recommends this as a way of ensuring America's security and prosperity in trade. Paine also argues that America is sufficiently small as to be united now. If time were to elapse, and the population of the colonies to grow, the same feeling of unity would not be present. Paine adds that if the Americans revolt now, they can use the vast expanses of uncharted land to the West in order to pay down some of the debt they will incur.
Paine says that as a colony of Britain, America lacks respectability on the international scene. They are seen simply as rebels, and cannot form substantial alliances with other nations. In order to prosper in the long term, the colonies need to be independent. Paine says that, by declaring independence, America will be able to ask for the help of other countries in its struggle for freedom. For all of these reasons, Paine says it is imperative and urgent that the colonies declare independence."
Smallest,"A Small Place is divided into four loosely structured, untitled sections. The first section begins with Kincaid’s narration of the reader’s experiences and thoughts as a hypothetical tourist in Antigua. The reader, through Kincaid’s description, witnesses the great natural beauty of the island, while being sheltered from the harsher realities of the lives of those who must live there. Kincaid weaves into her narrative the sort of information that only an “insider” would know, such as the reason why the majority of the automobiles on the island are poorly running, expensive Japanese cars. Included in her guided tour are brief views of the mansions on the island, mostly gained through corruption or outright criminality. She also mentions the now-dilapidated library, still awaiting repairs after an earthquake ten years earlier. The tour continues at the hotel, and Kincaid concludes the section with a discussion of her view of the moral ugliness of being a tourist.
The second section deals with Kincaid’s memories of the “old” Antigua, the colonial possession of Great Britain. Kincaid recalls the casual racism of the times, and the subservience of Antigua to England and, especially, to English culture. She delves briefly into the history of Barclay’s Bank and discusses the Mill Reef Club, an elite, all-white enclave built by wealthy foreigners. She describes and deplores the great hoopla made over the visit of Princess Margaret to the island when Kincaid was a child. Much of the section is concerned with the distortions that colonialism has created in the minds of the Antiguans; Antiguans do not tend to recognize racism as such, says Kincaid, and the bad behavior of individual English people never seems to affect the general reverence for English culture. For Kincaid, the problem is compounded by the fact that the people of Antigua can express themselves only in the language of those who enslaved and oppressed them. She then discusses the connection she sees between the colonial past of the island and its impoverished, corrupt present.
The third section, the longest, deals with Antigua’s present and begins with Kincaid asking herself the disturbing question of whether, considering the state of the island today, things weren’t, in fact, better in the old days. As an example, she takes the state of the library, awaiting repairs after all these years and forced to reside in “temporary” quarters above a dry goods store. Kincaid has fond, if ambivalent, feelings toward the old library, which was a haven of beauty and an escape into reading for her as a child. She recalls the imperious ways of the head librarian (who suspected Kincaid, rightly, of stealing books), who is now sadly reduced to campaigning, mostly unsuccessfully, for funds to build a new library, while the collection decomposes in cardboard boxes.
The rich members of the Mill Reef Club have the funds to help, but will do so only if the old library is rebuilt—a demand that Kincaid sees as having more to do with nostalgia for the colonial regime than with a true desire to help. Kincaid mentions the ironies involved in Antigua having a Minister of Culture without having a culture to administer. She also mentions her politically active mother’s run-in with the current Minister of Culture, who has allowed the library to languish. Education has clearly suffered on Antigua in the years since independence, and Kincaid ruefully notes the poor speech habits of the younger Antiguans.
Kincaid discusses the way Antiguans experience the passage of time, and connects this to their oddly detached view of the corruption of their government. She then goes into a litany of the many abuses of power on the island, including misappropriation of funds, kickbacks, drug smuggling, and even political violence—all of which are known by the average Antiguan. Kincaid then discusses the political history of Antigua since independence, showing how power has rested in the same hands for most of the period, with one brief, unimpressive exception. Kincaid sees corruption as an ingrained element of political life on the island, so much so that government officials who do not steal are held in contempt as fools rather than admired for their honesty. She tells of the fears that many Antiguans have for the future and hints that open dictatorship or political upheaval may lie ahead.
The fourth, and final, section is a sort of coda to the piece, starting with an evocation of the intense physical beauty of the island. She describes the beauty as so extreme as to appear “unreal,” almost like an illustration or a stage-set. Kincaid says that the beauty of their surroundings is a mixed blessing to the Antiguans, who are trapped in an unchanging setting in which their poverty is part of the scenery. The slaves who were brought to Antigua by force were victims, and therefore noble—but their descendants, today’s Antiguans, are simple human beings, with all the problems and contradictions of human beings anywhere."
Firefighter,"Guy Montag is a fireman who burns books in a futuristic American city. In Montag’s world, firemen start fires rather than putting them out. The people in this society do not read books, enjoy nature, spend time by themselves, think independently, or have meaningful conversations. Instead, they drive very fast, watch excessive amounts of television on wall-size sets, and listen to the radio on “Seashell Radio” sets attached to their ears.
Montag encounters a gentle seventeen-year-old girl named Clarisse McClellan, who opens his eyes to the emptiness of his life with her innocently penetrating questions and her unusual love of people and nature. Over the next few days, Montag experiences a series of disturbing events. First, his wife, Mildred, attempts suicide by swallowing a bottle of sleeping pills. Then, when he responds to an alarm that an old woman has a stash of hidden literature, the woman shocks him by choosing to be burned alive along with her books. A few days later, he hears that Clarisse has been killed by a speeding car. Montag’s dissatisfaction with his life increases, and he begins to search for a solution in a stash of books that he has stolen from his own fires and hidden inside an air-conditioning vent.
When Montag fails to show up for work, his fire chief, Beatty, pays a visit to his house. Beatty explains that it’s normal for a fireman to go through a phase of wondering what books have to offer, and he delivers a dizzying monologue explaining how books came to be banned in the first place. According to Beatty, special-interest groups and other “minorities” objected to books that offended them. Soon, books all began to look the same, as writers tried to avoid offending anybody. This was not enough, however, and society as a whole decided to simply burn books rather than permit conflicting opinions. Beatty tells Montag to take twenty-four hours or so to see if his stolen books contain anything worthwhile and then turn them in for incineration. Montag begins a long and frenzied night of reading.
Overwhelmed by the task of reading, Montag looks to his wife for help and support, but she prefers television to her husband’s company and cannot understand why he would want to take the terrible risk of reading books. He remembers that he once met a retired English professor named Faber sitting in a park, and he decides that this man might be able to help him understand what he reads. He visits Faber, who tells him that the value of books lies in the detailed awareness of life that they contain. Faber says that Montag needs not only books but also the leisure to read them and the freedom to act upon their ideas.
Faber agrees to help Montag with his reading, and they concoct a risky scheme to overthrow the status quo. Faber will contact a printer and begin reproducing books, and Montag will plant books in the homes of firemen to discredit the profession and to destroy the machinery of censorship. Faber gives him a two-way radio earpiece (the “green bullet”) so that he can hear what Montag hears and talk to him secretly.
Montag goes home, and soon two of his wife’s friends arrive to watch television. The women discuss their families and the war that is about to be declared in an extremely frivolous manner. Their superficiality angers him, and he takes out a book of poetry and reads “Dover Beach” by Matthew Arnold. Faber buzzes in his ear for him to be quiet, and Mildred tries to explain that the poetry reading is a standard way for firemen to demonstrate the uselessness of literature. The women are extremely disturbed by the poem and leave to file a complaint against Montag.
Montag goes to the fire station and hands over one of his books to Beatty. Beatty confuses Montag by barraging him with contradictory quotations from great books. Beatty exploits these contradictions to show that literature is morbid and dangerously complex, and that it deserves incineration. Suddenly, the alarm sounds, and they rush off to answer the call, only to find that the alarm is at Montag’s own house. Mildred gets into a cab with her suitcase, and Montag realizes that his own wife has betrayed him.
Beatty forces Montag to burn the house himself; when he is done, Beatty places him under arrest. When Beatty continues to berate Montag, Montag turns the flamethrower on his superior and proceeds to burn him to ashes. Montag knocks the other firemen unconscious and runs. The Mechanical Hound, a monstrous machine that Beatty has set to attack Montag, pounces and injects Montag’s leg with a large dose of anesthetic. Montag manages to destroy it with his flamethrower; then he walks off the numbness in his leg and escapes with some books that were hidden in his backyard. He hides these in another fireman’s house and calls in an alarm from a pay phone.
Montag goes to Faber’s house, where he learns that a new Hound has been put on his trail, along with several helicopters and a television crew. Faber tells Montag that he is leaving for St. Louis to see a retired printer who may be able to help them. Montag gives Faber some money and tells him how to remove Montag’s scent from his house so the Hound will not enter it. Montag then takes some of Faber’s old clothes and runs off toward the river. The whole city watches as the chase unfolds on TV, but Montag manages to escape in the river and change into Faber’s clothes to disguise his scent. He drifts downstream into the country and follows a set of abandoned railroad tracks until he finds a group of renegade intellectuals (“the Book People”), led by a man named Granger, who welcome him. They are a part of a nationwide network of book lovers who have memorized many great works of literature and philosophy. They hope that they may be of some help to mankind in the aftermath of the war that has just been declared. Montag’s role is to memorize the Book of Ecclesiastes. Enemy jets appear in the sky and completely obliterate the city with bombs. Montag and his new friends move on to search for survivors and rebuild civilization."
Admission,"A Raisin in the Sun portrays a few weeks in the life of the Youngers, a Black family living on the South Side of Chicago in the 1950s. When the play opens, the Youngers are about to receive an insurance check for $10,000. This money comes from the deceased Mr. Younger’s life insurance policy. Each of the adult members of the family has an idea as to what he or she would like to do with this money. The matriarch of the family, Mama, wants to buy a house to fulfill a dream she shared with her husband. Mama’s son, Walter Lee, would rather use the money to invest in a liquor store with his friends. He believes that the investment will solve the family’s financial problems forever. Walter’s wife, Ruth, agrees with Mama, however, and hopes that she and Walter can provide more space and opportunity for their son, Travis. Finally, Beneatha, Walter’s sister and Mama’s daughter, wants to use the money for her medical school tuition. She also wishes that her family members were not so interested in assimilating into the white world. Beneatha instead tries to find her identity by looking back to the past and to Africa.
As the play progresses, the Youngers clash over their competing dreams. Ruth discovers that she is pregnant but fears that if she has the child, she will put more financial pressure on her family members. When Walter says nothing to Ruth’s admission that she is considering abortion, Mama puts a down payment on a house for the whole family. She believes that a bigger, brighter dwelling will help them all. This house is in Clybourne Park, an entirely white neighborhood. When the Youngers’ future neighbors find out that the Youngers are moving in, they send Mr. Lindner, from the Clybourne Park Improvement Association, to offer the Youngers money in return for staying away. The Youngers refuse the deal, even after Walter loses the rest of the money ($6,500) to his friend Willy Harris, who persuades Walter to invest in the liquor store and then runs off with his cash.
In the meantime, Beneatha rejects her suitor, George Murchison, whom she believes to be shallow and blind to the problems of race. Subsequently, she receives a marriage proposal from her Nigerian boyfriend, Joseph Asagai, who wants Beneatha to get a medical degree and move to Africa with him (Beneatha does not make her choice before the end of the play). The Youngers eventually move out of the apartment, fulfilling the family’s long-held dream. Their future seems uncertain and slightly dangerous, but they are optimistic and determined to live a better life. They believe that they can succeed if they stick together as a family and resolve to defer their dreams no longer."
Watchman,"Jean Louise Finch arrives in Maycomb, Alabama, traveling from New York City for her annual two-week visit home. Jean Louise’s father, Atticus Finch, is a prominent lawyer in town. Over the past few years, he has been suffering from arthritis, so his sister, Alexandra Finch, now lives with him. Jean Louise’s older brother, Jem, died of a sudden heart condition a few years ago when he was only in his early twenties.
Jean Louise reconnects with Henry “Hank” Clinton, who works in Atticus’s law office. Henry was Jem’s childhood best friend, and he and Jean Louise have been a couple for several years, but Jean Louise won’t commit to marrying him. Henry and Jean Louise visit Jean Louise’s ancestral home, where they go swimming late at night. Jean Louise has flashbacks to her childhood with Jem and her childhood friend, Dill. She fondly remembers re-enacting scenes from both fiction and reality with them. On the way back to town, a car full of black people passes them, going extremely fast, and Henry says that the black people have enough money to buy cars, but they don’t have licenses and insurance.
The next morning, Henry and Jean Louise’s trip has made the rounds of the town gossip, which scandalizes Alexandra, but Jean Louise and Atticus are mildly amused. The whole family goes to church, where the music director tries to conduct a hymn in a different rhythm, but the townspeople sing it exactly the way they’ve always been singing it.
After church, Atticus and Henry leave for a political meeting. Jean Louise finds a racist pamphlet titled “The Black Plague” among Atticus’s papers, and she is horrified. She follows Atticus and Henry to their meeting, which turns out to be a gathering of the Maycomb County Citizen’s Council, an organization promoting segregation and white supremacy. Nearly all the men in town are there, except Uncle Jack. The meeting is in the courthouse, and Jean Louise watches it from the same place where she and Jem sat as children to watch their father defend a black man who was on trial for rape. Then, Jean Louise was proud of her father for standing up for what was right. Now, Jean Louise is disgusted that her father can be part of something so racist. Jean Louise leaves and walks around town, feeling sickened and betrayed, and has flashbacks to her youth, in which Atticus had always been her rock-solid moral compass. Jean Louise also remembers Calpurnia, the black woman who had served as the Finches’ cook and a surrogate mother figure.
The next morning, the family learns that Calpurnia’s grandson had killed a pedestrian while speeding in his car. Atticus takes the case, but only to stop the NAACP from coming to town and getting involved. Jean Louise visits Calpurnia, but Calpurnia treats her politely and coldly, without a hint of affection. Jean Louise has lunch with Uncle Jack and asks him how Atticus could allow himself to be involved with a racist organization. Uncle Jack tries to explain that Atticus himself isn’t necessarily a racist, but he has to maintain appearances to the townspeople, and he has to understand what they’re up to (think “Know thy enemy”). Uncle Jack is trying to plant the seed for Jean Louise to come to a conclusion, but she doesn’t quite grasp what he’s trying to make her understand.
Jean Louise has a flashback to her adolescence, recalling the time that she and Henry went together to a dance. This was the first time that Jean Louise really began to feel like she was becoming a woman, not just a child or Jem’s little sister. The next day, the school principal found Jean Louise’s false bosoms, which had fallen during the night. Henry comes up with a scheme to save the day, and it later turns out that Atticus had had the idea but had planted the seed of it in Henry’s mind.
Jean Louise has coffee with Henry and tells him that she can never marry him. As she yells at Henry for being a hypocrite, she realizes that Atticus is standing right there. Jean Louise and Atticus go to his office, and they begin to argue about Brown v. Board of Education and the NAACP. Jean Louise is in favor of states’ rights, so she doesn’t entirely agree with the Supreme Court, but she argues that they had to do what was right morally, even if it might not have been the right decision politically. Atticus’s positions seem to go against everything he had taught her, and she lashes out at him.
Jean Louise goes home in a blinding rage to pack her things and leave. Uncle Jack comes over and slaps her. The slap shocks Jean Louise thoroughly, and she snaps out of her rage. He explains that Atticus is not an idol, but rather, is thoroughly human, and that Jean Louise has to rely on herself to be her own moral anchor. Jean Louise is chastened and decides to remain in Maycomb. She realizes that she won’t marry Henry. Jean Louise returns to the office to apologize to Atticus, but Atticus says that he is proud of her."
Bridge,"Jess Aarons is an eleven-year-old boy living in a rural area of the South who loves to run. He dreams of being the fastest boy in the fifth grade when school starts up in the fall, feeling that this will for once give him a chance to stand in the spotlight among his five sisters, and might win him the attention of his preoccupied father. Jess is quite insecure in his identity. He loves to paint and draw, but he knows very well that this labels him a ""sissy"" in the eyes of most of the world, particularly his father. In addition, his family is stretched so tight by poverty that he has little chance to really explore his own identity during this crucial period of adolescence. He has therefore built up the importance of winning in his mind, feeling that here, at least, is something that he is good at which won't win him an undesired label of ""sissy"" or ""girl"" in the eyes of his father or schoolmates, and which will allow him to shine in his own right. He practices each morning, always dreaming of his upcoming victory. However, when the races come around at recess, a new girl, Leslie Burke, who just moved next door to Jess, boldly crosses to the boys' side of the playground and beats everyone.
A rather unpromising beginning, but Jess and Leslie become fast friends. They build a secret fantasyland across the creek in the woods, called Terabithia, where they play all the time. There they forget the rest of the world, such as the kids at school or Jess's less-than-satisfactory family. The time they spend in Terabithia, in fact, seems to strengthen them for these trials of everyday life: it is there that they map out a plan of revenge on the school bully when she steals May Belle's Twinkies, and it is there that they discuss Jess's feelings of insecurity when Leslie begins to draw closer to her father. Leslie also introduces Jess to the world of imagination and creativity, telling him the stories of such classics of literature as 
Moby Dick
 and 
Hamlet
. All this also strengthens Jess's artistic talent and ability, as Leslie supports his ambition and, through the stories she tells, provides him with great subject matter. But much of the time they play wonderful games of their own invention—defeating intruders on Terabithian territory, praying to the Spirits of the Grove to end a long spell of rain, and numerous other fantasies.
However, Jess and Leslie's friendship, though centered in Terabithia, is not limited to Terabithia. They see each other at school, where they take a good deal of ribbing for their cross-gender friendship, but by now that sort of teasing has lost the power to hurt Jess, and Leslie has never been particularly bothered by what others think. At home, they celebrate holidays together, such as Christmas, when Jess gives Leslie a puppy and she gives him an expensive art set to develop his artistic talent, and Easter, when Leslie goes to church for the first time with Jess. Leslie is impressed by the beauty of the story of Christ. Jess and his little sister May Belle, cowed by negative and unforgiving religious training, are convinced that nonbelievers such as Leslie are doomed to hell, and find the whole experience disturbing. Nevertheless, Jess and Leslie remain the best of friends, and Jess finds a purpose in his life through Leslie's company that he's never had before.
One day the music teacher at school, Miss Edmunds, whom Jess has long had a crush on, invites him to spend a day with her touring the art galleries in Washington. This trip does much to expand his mind and make him feel as if he is special, a feeling he has previously only had in Leslie's company. Jess has a perfect day, but when he gets home he is told that Leslie drowned in the creek that morning trying to swing into Terabithia on the rope that they used for that purpose. Jess is completely devastated and goes through the stages of grief—denial, anger, fear, and sorrow—all incredibly painful to suffer and, indeed, to read about. Initially, he does not see how he is to go on initially. Leslie has raised him to new heights as the king of Terabithia, and now he feels that without her, he has no choice but to revert to the old Jess, plagued by fear and insecurity. However, eventually he realizes that he can only keep Leslie's memory, and his own newfound sense of self, alive by continuing the fantasy of Terabithia. He brings his little sister May Belle there and makes her its new queen, assuring that a part of Leslie will live on as well."
Straight,"Looking for Alaska tells the story of Miles “Pudge” Halter, a high school junior who divides his life into time before and time after a life-changing event that the reader will not discover until later in the novel. 
Miles plans to attend the Culver Creek boarding school for his junior year of high school. Although his parents worry that Miles wants to attend the school because he does not have friends at his current school, Miles reveals that he is actually influenced by the last words of the poet François Rabelais about “seeking the Great Perhaps.” He moves to Birmingham, Alabama to attend Culver Creek and becomes friends with his roommate, Chip “The Colonel” Martin. Chip teaches Miles about the social structure of the school. He explains that the wealthy students that go home to their parents’ mansions every weekend (the “Weekday Warriors”) do not get along with his friend group. 
Chip introduces Miles to his friend Alaska, and Miles is quickly enamored by her. While Miles is obsessed with people’s final words and wants to seek François Rabelais’s “Great Perhaps,” Alaska enjoys books and wants to know the nature of “the labyrinth of suffering” that Simón Bolívar evoked in his final words.
The Weekday Warriors sneak into Chip and Miles’s dorm on Miles’s first night and throw Miles into the lake with his limbs bound by tape. Chip and Miles discover that this action was taken in retaliation for Chip supposedly ratting out their friends—a couple named Marya and Paul—and getting them expelled the previous year. Miles, Chip, Alaska, and another friend, Takumi, begin planning a revenge prank. Miles becomes part of their friend group and starts smoking cigarettes. The four of them get caught smoking and Alaska and Chip cover for Miles and Takumi, demonstrating to Miles that you cover for your friends instead of ratting them out. 
Miles settles into his new school and does well in his classes because he spends so much time studying. Alaska decides she will find Miles a girlfriend, and eventually introduces him to a Romanian student named Lara. Miles embarrasses himself on the first group date at a basketball game with Alaska, Alaska’s boyfriend Jake, Chip, Chip’s girlfriend Sara, Takumi, and Lara. Miles is hit by a basketball, gets concussed, and then vomits on Lara. Afterward, Miles tries to talk to Alaska, but is confused when Alaska becomes moody and short with him for no apparent reason.
The Weekday Warriors target Alaska with a prank, reminding Chip and Alaska they need to work on their own revenge prank. Takumi reveals to Miles that it was actually Alaska who ratted out the couple who were expelled the previous year. Takumi warns Miles that he cannot rat anyone else out if he gets caught carrying out the revenge prank. Miles is still infatuated with Alaska and asks his parents to let him stay at school over Thanksgiving break so he can be with her. Although he knows she has a boyfriend, Miles wants to be with Alaska. They ultimately spend Thanksgiving Day with Chip and his mom.
Lara joins Alaska, Chip, Takumi, and Miles as they execute their revenge prank on the Weekday Warriors. They set off fireworks and put dye in the Weekday Warriors’ hair products. They also get on the computer of the Dean (whom they call “the Eagle”) to send bad grade reports to the parents of the Weekday Warriors. The five of them spend the remainder of the night and weekend camping and hiding in a barn on campus as their alibi is that they were all off campus. They play a drinking game and Alaska reveals that, as a child, she saw her mom die of an aneurysm and did not call an ambulance because she thought her mom was just sleeping. When they quit playing the drinking game, Miles kisses Lara. He asks if she wants to be his girlfriend and she says yes. 
Miles spends time with Lara despite not having much to talk about, but they are physically intimate. He leaves Lara to spend time with Alaska and Chip in his room, watching them as they get drunk. Alaska dares Miles to make out with her. He does and she tells him it is to be continued in the future. They all go to sleep. Chip and Miles are startled awake later by Alaska frantically telling them she needs to leave because she had forgotten something. They provide a distraction for the Eagle so she can get in her car and drive away unnoticed.
The Eagle calls an assembly to announce to the student body that Alaska has died. Miles asks what happened and is informed that she drove straight into a police cruiser with its lights and sirens on, likely due to driving while intoxicated. Both Chip and Miles feel responsible for her death because they helped her drive away when they knew she was drunk. They mourn in different ways and attend Alaska’s funeral.
Miles and Chip go through Alaska’s room to see if there is anything they want to keep. They find a note she wrote in one of her books that said “straight and fast” was the way out of the labyrinth of suffering. This revelation makes Chip and Miles think she may have killed herself. Chip is eager to investigate her death and Miles reluctantly agrees to help. 
Religion class becomes more important to Miles after Alaska’s death because its subject matter becomes more real. Chip and Miles vent their anger to each other that so many people who did not know Alaska like they did are mourning her death. Chip leads their investigation into Alaska’s death. 
Chip and Miles interview the police officer who saw Alaska crash. Their interview supports their belief that she killed herself, so they research suicide warning signs. They do not remember Alaska exhibiting many of the warning signs and continue their investigation. Meanwhile, Miles avoids Lara. Takumi questions Miles about whether he is still dating Lara, and Takumi demands that Chip and Miles tell him about what they have been doing. They agree to tell him about their investigation in the future. 
Chip plans to see if Alaska might have been unable to swerve because of how drunk she was. He and Miles steal a breathalyzer from the Eagle and Chip drinks enough alcohol to match Alaska’s blood alcohol level at her time of death. He believes she would have been able to swerve, so he plans to call Jake, Alaska’s boyfriend, as a final effort. Miles is against calling Jake, but Chip does it anyway. They learn that Alaska told Jake that she would call him later, which further confuses the question of whether she killed herself or not.
Chip and Miles do not know what to investigate next, so they turn their attention to planning a prank in memory of Alaska. Chip pulls out plans Alaska had made for a prank, and Chip and Miles recruit other juniors at the school to execute it. They hire a male stripper, posing as a psychologist, to give a presentation at a Speaker’s Day event at their school. He delivers a speech about subverting the patriarchal paradigm and performs in front of the whole student body. 
Later in the year, Takumi points out to Chip and Miles that the date of Alaska’s death coincides with the date of the story Alaska shared with them about her mother’s death when they played a drinking game in the barn. The boys realize she must have forgotten the anniversary of her mother’s death and was driving to her grave to deliver flowers. Although they still feel guilty for helping her drive away drunk, and they do not know for sure whether it was an accident or suicide, they feel like they now have the closure they needed. 
“Straight and fast” was Alaska’s way out of the labyrinth of suffering, but Miles decides to choose the labyrinth over an escape. Miles feels more confident about seeking the Great Perhaps, despite the grief he experienced by loving and losing Alaska."
Cast,"The body of Chase Andrews is found by two boys next to an abandoned fire tower in the swamp on October 30, 1969.
In 1952, six-year-old Kya watches her mother leave their shack in the marsh. Before long, her siblings, including her beloved 12-year-old brother Jodie, depart too, leaving Kya alone with Pa, a drunken, disabled World War II vet prone to violent rages. Pa gives Kya a dollar a week for food. In town, older boys, including Chase Andrews, pass her on their bikes. Kya spends most of her time in the marsh with the gulls.
Mrs. Culpepper, a truant officer, takes Kya to school, where she is humiliated and never returns. Over the years, townspeople call her “dirty,” “the Marsh Girl,” “Missing Link,” and “marsh trash.”
Kya takes Pa’s fishing boat exploring. When she gets lost, one of Jodie’s friends, Tate Walker, guides her back to her channel. Tate lives alone in town with his dad, Scupper, a fisherman. 
For a while, Kya and Pa fish together and enjoy each other’s company. Pa introduces Kya to Jumpin’, an older Black man who sells gas and supplies. Kya’s mother sends a letter, but Pa burns it and returns to drinking. Pa finally disappears when Kya is ten years old. Kya supports herself selling mussels to Jumpin’, whose wife Mabel collects clothes for Kya from Colored Town. Kya continues watching Tate as well as Chase and his friends.
When she is 14 years old, Kya finds a series of special feathers left in a tree stump in the marsh. One day, she leaves a special feather in return. After that, Tate appears at the stump and offers to teach her to read. Tate and Kya begin to meet at a secret cabin in the marsh where he teaches her to read. As Kya matures, Tate brings her a biology textbook and Mabel gives her a bra. One day Tate finds Kya sick on Point Beach. He explains to her that she is having her period. Kya and Tate continue their lessons and she invites him inside her shack and shows him her collection of natural objects. One day, Tate kisses Kya and they begin a romantic relationship. Their desire grows but they avoid having sex. Tate leaves early for college and tells Kya he will visit on the 4th of July. However, he doesn’t return. Kya, devastated, returns to studying nature.
When Kya is 19 years old, Chase catches her eye on Point Beach. He is a popular, good looking, confident, former high school quarterback. Chase approaches Kya on Jumpin’s wharf and invites her on a picnic. 
At the picnic, Chase gives Kya a rare scallop shell. He is sexually aggressive and she runs away. When Kya and Chase meet ten days later, he apologizes and takes her to see the abandoned fire tower. Kya gives Chase a necklace made from the scallop shell. Chase says he won’t approach her sexually unless she wants him to.
Kya gets closer to Chase. Tate, who is home from college, wants to apologize to Kya, but sees her kissing Chase and turns away. Chase starts talking about marriage and invites Kya on an overnight trip. She joins him and they have unsatisfying sex in a cheap motel room. Still, their relationship continues. However, Chase won’t introduce Kya to his parents or friends and disappears for a week over Christmas. 
Tate comes to the lagoon to warn Kya that Chase is seeing other women, but she throws rocks at him. Still, she invites him into the shack and he offers to find a publisher for a book of her nature paintings. 
Kya sees the engagement announcement in the newspaper for Chase and Pearl, a girl she recognizes from Point Beach. She recites poems by Amanda Hamilton, who publishes in the local newspaper, to soothe herself. She determines to live her life alone.
A year later, Kya receives a copy of her first book. She uses the advance money to improve and modernize the shack. She gives Tate a copy of her book. 
Kya’s brother Jodie visits the shack. He tells her that Ma has died and promises to keep in touch. He encourages her to reconcile with Tate.
In August of 1969, Chase sneaks up on Kya on a remote beach, attacks and tries to rape her. She fights him off and sees two fishermen watching from their boat as she leaves. Tate and Jumpin’ see her bruises, but she begs them not to tell anyone. Chase continues to come to her shack, but she hides from him. Kya gets a letter from her publisher, Robert Foster, to meet him in Greenville. She finds out from Tate how to buy a bus ticket and goes to meet him on October 28, returning on October 30, the day Chase’s body is found.
Sheriff Ed Jackson and his deputy Joe Perdue investigate Chase’s death. No footprints or fingerprints are found at the scene. They think Chase was pushed through an open gate and the murderer covered up the scene. Almost immediately, everyone in town suspects “the Marsh Girl.” 
Over time, Joe and Ed’s main clue consists of red wool fibers on Chase’s jacket. Also, Chase’s mother Patti Love tells them Chase was wearing the shell necklace when he left her house that night, but it was not found at the scene. A shrimper, Hal Miller, tells them he saw Kya’s boat headed toward the fire tower the night Chase died. However, Tate and Jumpin’ and townspeople who saw her get on and off the bus to Greenville give Kya an alibi. A fisherman, Rodney Horn, who heard Kya yelling and saw her leaving after Chase attacked her, heard her say she would kill Chase if he bothered her again. Joe and Ed find a red wool hat in Kya’s shack that Tate gave her and that matches the fibers on Chase’s coat. With this information, they arrest Kya for murder.
Kya spends two months in jail awaiting trial. A lawyer, Tom Milton, volunteers to defend her. 
A kind guard at the prison, Jacob, lets the cat, Sunday Justice, into her cell for company. Tate, Jumpin’, and Mabel sit behind Kya in court for support. They are later joined by Jodie, Robert Foster, and Scupper. 
Prosecutor Eric Chastain calls his witnesses and Tom Milton counters their testimony. The jury learns that it would have been possible for Kya to take buses back and forth from Greenville on the night of the murder, but the timing is very tight. Tom calls defense witnesses, including Kya’s publisher Robert Foster. After closing statements, everyone awaits the verdict. Kya is found not guilty. Jodie takes her home, where she is delighted to see the marsh again. 
Kya sees Tate in his boat and is going to approach him, but the sheriff and two deputies arrive and take Tate with them. She learns that Scupper has had a stroke and died.
The day after Scupper’s funeral, Tate finds a feather in his boat from Kya. At the shack, they express their love for each other and Tate moves in with her. Over the years, Jumpin’ dies, and Jodie and his wife and children visit the shack. Tate works at the nearby lab and Kya writes seven more books. 
One day Tate finds Kya in her boat, dead of a heart attack at age 64. On her tombstone, he inscribes “The Marsh Girl.” Many townspeople come to Kya’s funeral on her land. That night, Tate finds two items beneath the floorboards. One is a box of poems by Amanda Hamilton, a pseudonym Kya used, including a poem describing Chase Andrews’ death. Tate also finds the shell necklace Kya gave Chase. Tate burns the poems and rawhide cord and crushes the shell on the beach for the tide to take away."
Respectable,"The Good Soldier opens with John Dowell, the narrator, informing the reader that ""this is the saddest story [he] ever heard."" His story, he explains will be about the nine-year acquaintance that he and his wife Florence had with another couple, Edward and Leonora Ashburnham. Because this novel is comprised of Dowell's thoughts as he writes them, the plot is not chronological; it shifts back and forth between past events and Dowell's current reflections on those events. Overall, the novel is divided into four parts.
In Part 1 of The Good Soldier, Dowell explains the background of the four protagonists. He and Florence are Americans, from Philadelphia and Stamford, Connecticut, respectively. Edward and Leonora are British, the former a Catholic from Ireland, and the latter an Anglican from a respected family in Fordingbridge. Dowell sees similarities between the two couples. Both Dowell's wife, Florence, and Edward Ashburnham are ""heart patients."" The couples meet in Nauheim, a health spa, in August 1904 where both ""invalids"" come to improve their health.
The four strike up a friendship. Dowell describes Edward as perfectly honest and upright, someone with whom you could trust your wife. Dowell goes on to narrate in detail an excursion that the two couples took to a town which houses Martin Luther's protest. In the bedroom, while Florence is discussing the Protest, Leonora realizes Florence and Edward will have an affair. Dowell is blind to this implication. In this part of the novel, Dowell compares their friendship to a minuet, and to ""an extraordinarily safe castle,"" but then he bemoans the end of permanence and stability now that their friendship, nine years later, is over.
Edward has been having numerous affairs: with a woman in the back of a railway car, with the mistress of a Grand Duke in Monte Carlo, with a woman married to an army officer in India, and with a young, submissive woman the Ashburnhams have brought with them from India to Nauheim. After the affair with La Dolciquita, Edward brought the Ashburnhams into deep debt, and Leonora took complete control of all his money and land. The Ashburnhams have been in India eight years to save money, and now that they are in Nauheim, Leonora feels she has regained control of their lives. On the day that they meet the Dowells, Leonora sees Maisie Maidan coming out of her husband's bedroom and she assumes they are having an affair. She boxes Mrs. Maidan's ears, and Florence sees this act of violence. Leonora, who cares deeply about propriety, attempts to befriend Florence to cover up what has been witnessed; that is how the two couples become friends.
Part 1 ends with Mrs. Maidan's death. Now that Florence has started an affair with Edward, Mrs. Maidan overhears them talking about her, and finds out that Leonora has brought her along so that she may be a ""safe"" mistress for Edward. Mrs. Maidan is appalled and dies. Unlike Florence and Edward, she suffers from a real heart condition. Leonora lives with the guilt over this death.
In Part 2, Dowell explains Florence's real desire to be the lady of Fordingbridge, in the town in England where her ancestors were forced to live centuries ago. Edward Ashburnham's estate, Branshaw Manor, is in Fordingbridge. The chapter flashes back to Dowell and Florence's first meeting in Connecticut. They were married against the wishes of Florence's aunts, the Misses Hurlbird, and immediately left for Europe. On the boat trip to Europe, Florence feigned a heart condition, and her pretend heart condition keeps them forever trapped on the European continent. While Dowell and Florence lived in Paris, Florence has an affair with a low-class artist named Jimmy, but Dowell knows nothing about it. Dowell's own marriage to Florence has remained unconsummated for thirteen years.
After Florence's nine-year affair with Edward, she plans to divorce Dowell and marry Edward. But one night, August 4, 1913, Florence sees Edward in the park alone at night with his young ward, Nancy. She grows insanely jealous and runs back to the hotel, only to find an old acquaintance, Mr. Bagshawe, telling Dowell about Florence's indecent relationship with Jimmy many years ago. Part II ends with the discovery of Florence's dead body; she has poisoned herself.
Part 3 opens with Dowell considering marriage to Nancy, the Ashburnhams"" young ward. But Edward, too, is in love with her. Nancy, who has recently left convent school, admires her uncle immensely for his heroic deeds and she assumes he and Leonora have a healthy marriage; she is not in love with him in the same way. After Florence's death, Leonora, Edward, and Nancy all return to Branshaw Manor in England. There, Leonora has a nervous breakdown, since she surmises that Edward is in love with Nancy. In this section, Dowell narrates the entire history of Edward and Leonora's marriage. Through all his affairs, Leonora always hoped that Edward would return to her and love her again. But when Edward began his affair with Florence, Leonora's love died.
In Part 4, Leonora realizes that Nancy is safe from Edward. She sees that the small amount of sexual morality that her husband possesses will keep him from starting an affair with Nancy. She has a breakdown and tells Nancy what a terrible husband Edward is. Nancy's ideals are crushed, and her eyes are opened to the realities of the world. Dowell says that together, Leonora and Nancy begin to slowly torture of Edward. He suffers greatly and plans for Nancy to travel to India to live with her father. She sends a telegram from India saying she is having a good time. Edward is crushed. All he desires is to have her worship him from afar. Edward commits suicide by stabbing himself with a penknife. Leonora remarries a ""perfectly normal"" man named Rodney Bayham and they have a child. Nancy goes mad. The only word she can say is ""shuttlecock."" Dowell buys Branshaw Manor and becomes Nancy's permanent caretaker."
Fellow,"The Fellowship of the Ring is the first of three volumes in The Lord of the Rings, an epic set in the fictional world of Middle-earth. The Lord of the Rings is an entity named Sauron, the Dark Lord, who long ago lost the One Ring that contains much of his power. His overriding desire is to reclaim the Ring and use it to enslave all of Middle-earth. 
The story of The Lord of the Rings begins with several events that take place in The Hobbit. While wandering lost in a deep cave, Bilbo Baggins, a Hobbit—one of a small, kindly race about half the size of Men—stumbles upon a ring and takes it back with him to the Shire, the part of Middle-earth that is the Hobbits’ home. All Bilbo knows of his ring is that wearing it causes him to become invisible. He is unaware that it is the One Ring, and is therefore oblivious to its significance and to the fact that Sauron has been searching for it.

The Fellowship of the Ring opens with a party for Bilbo’s 111th birthday. Bilbo gives his ring to his heir, his cousin Frodo Baggins. When the time comes to part with the ring, however, Bilbo becomes strangely reluctant to do so. He gives up the ring only at the determined urging of his friend, Gandalf the Grey, a great Wizard. Gandalf suspects that the ring is indeed the One Ring of legend. After confirming his suspicions, he tells Frodo that the Ring must be taken away from the Shire, as Sauron’s power is growing once again.
Frodo sets out from the Shire with three of his Hobbit friends—Sam, Merry, and Pippin. Along the way, they are pursued by the nine Ringwraiths, servants of Sauron who take the form of terrifying Black Riders. The hobbits spend a night in the company of wandering Elves, who promise to send word ahead to friends who will protect the hobbits. Barely out of the Shire, the hobbits get lost in the Old Forest, where they have to be rescued from a malevolent willow tree, which swallows up Merry and Pippin, and then from an evil tomb ghost. The hobbits’ rescuer is Tom Bombadil, a strange, jovial entity with great powers who is the oldest creature in Middle-earth.
The hobbits make it to the town of Bree, where they meet Aragorn, a Ranger who roams the wilderness and who is the heir of the Kings of the ancient Men of Westernesse. Those who do not know Aragorn’s true name call him Strider. Frodo tries to keep a low profile at the inn in Bree, but he ends up causing a scene when while taking part in a rollicking rendition of a song he falls, accidentally slips the Ring onto his finger, and vanishes.
That night, Aragorn advises the hobbits not to sleep in their rooms at the inn. In doing so, he saves their lives—for the first of many times. A letter Gandalf left at the inn months before advises the group to head for Rivendell, a realm of the Elves. Aragorn sets out with the hobbits the next day, and with his help they avoid the Black Riders for some time. However, at the top of the hill Weathertop, the Company is forced to defend itself against the attacking Riders. Frodo is wounded during the skirmish.
Frodo’s wound, made by a weapon of a servant of Sauron, plagues the hobbit as the Company makes its way eastward. Aragorn is greatly concerned about the power the wound might exert over Frodo. Near Rivendell they meet the Elf-lord Glorfindel, who has been out looking for them. At the last ford before Rivendell, Frodo, riding Glorfindel’s horse, outruns the ambushing Black Riders, who are swept away in a flood created by Elrond, the master of Rivendell.
Elrond heals Frodo and then holds a meeting to discuss what to do about the Ring. During this Council, Frodo learns the full history of the Ring. Frodo accepts the burden of taking the Ring to the only place it can be destroyed—the place where it was forged. It promises to be a long, nearly impossible journey, as the Ring was forged in the Cracks of Doom, part of the fiery mountain Orodruin in the very heart of Sauron’s realm of Mordor.
At the end of the meeting, the Council creates a group to help Frodo in his quest. In addition to Frodo, the Fellowship of the Ring includes Sam, Merry, Pippin, Aragorn, Gandalf, an Elf named Legolas, a Dwarf named Gimli, and a Man from the south named Boromir.
The Fellowship heads south and attempts to pass over the Misty Mountains via the pass of Caradhras. Their way is blocked by snow and rock slides, and they are forced to divert their path through the Mines of Moria—the ancient, underground realm of the Dwarves. During the journey through Moria, Gandalf falls into the chasm of Khazad-dûm while protecting the Company from a Balrog, a terrible demon.
The rest of the party continues on to Lórien, the forest of the Galadrim Elves, where the Lady Galadriel tests their hearts and gives them gifts to help them on the quest. Frodo, spellbound by Galadriel’s power and wisdom, offers her the Ring. She refuses, however, saying that, despite her intentions, the Ring would corrupt her; ultimately, she would only replace Sauron.
Leaving Lórien, the Fellowship travels by boat down the Great River, Anduin. At night, they spot Gollum—a deformed creature that had once owned the Ring but then lost it to Bilbo Baggins in The Hobbit—following them. When they reach the Falls of Rauros, the Fellowship must decide whether to head toward Mordor on the east or toward the safety of the city of Minas Tirith to the west.
Boromir, overcome by the Ring’s power and desiring the Ring for himself, confronts Frodo. Frodo fends off Boromir and decides that he must go on to Mordor rather than to the safety of Minas Tirith. However, Frodo cannot bear the thought of imperiling his friends on the dangerous journey or allowing the Ring to corrupt them, so he attempts to leave secretly and continue the quest alone. Frodo does not, however, manage to elude Sam, so the two of them set out together for Mordor."
Ornament,"Janie Crawford, an attractive, confident, middle-aged Black woman, returns to Eatonville, Florida, after a long absence. The Black townspeople gossip about her and speculate about where she has been and what has happened to her young husband, Tea Cake. They take her confidence as aloofness, but Janie’s friend Pheoby Watson sticks up for her. Pheoby visits her to find out what has happened. Their conversation frames the story that Janie relates.
Janie explains that her grandmother raised her after her mother ran off. Nanny loves her granddaughter and is dedicated to her, but her life as a slave and experience with her own daughter, Janie’s mother, has warped her worldview. Her primary desire is to marry Janie as soon as possible to a husband who can provide security and social status for her. She finds a much older farmer named Logan Killicks and insists that Janie marry him.
After moving in with Logan, Janie is miserable. Logan is pragmatic and unromantic and, in general, treats her like a pack mule. One day, Joe Starks, a smooth-tongued and ambitious man, ambles down the road in front of the farm. He and Janie flirt in secret for a couple weeks before she runs off and marries him.
Janie and Jody, as she calls him, travel to all-Black Eatonville, where Jody hopes to have a “big voice.” A consummate politician, Jody soon succeeds in becoming the mayor, postmaster, storekeeper, and the biggest landlord in town. But Janie seeks something more than a man with a big voice. She soon becomes disenchanted with the monotonous, stifling life that she shares with Jody. She wishes that she could be a part of the rich social life in town, but Jody doesn’t allow her to interact with “common” people. Jody sees Janie as the fitting ornament to his wealth and power, and he tries to shape her into his vision of what a mayor’s wife should be. On the surface, Janie silently submits to Jody; inside, however, she remains passionate and full of dreams.
After almost two decades of marriage, Janie finally asserts herself. When Jody insults her appearance, Janie rips him to shreds in front of the townspeople, telling them all how ugly and impotent he is. In retaliation, he savagely beats her. Their marriage breaks down, and Jody becomes quite ill. After months without interacting, Janie visits him on his deathbed. Refusing to be silenced, she once again chastises him for the way that he treated her. As she berates him, he dies.
After Jody’s funeral, Janie feels free for the first time in years. She rebuffs various suitors who come to court her because she loves her newfound independence. But when Tea Cake, a man twelve years her junior, enters her life, Janie immediately senses a spark of mutual attraction. She begins dating Tea Cake despite critical gossip within the town. To everyone’s shock, Janie then marries Tea Cake nine months after Jody’s death, sells Jody’s store, and leaves town to go with Tea Cake to Jacksonville.
During the first week of their marriage, Tea Cake and Janie encounter difficulties. He steals her money and leaves her alone one night, making her think that he married her only for her money. But he returns, explaining that he never meant to leave her and that his theft occurred in a moment of weakness. Afterward, they promise to share all their experiences and opinions with each other. They move to the Everglades, where they work during the harvest season and socialize during the summer off-season. Tea Cake’s quick wit and friendliness make their shack the center of entertainment and social life.
A terrible hurricane bursts into the Everglades two years after Janie and Tea Cake’s marriage. As they desperately flee the rising waters, a rabid dog bites Tea Cake. At the time, Tea Cake doesn’t realize the dog’s condition; three weeks later, however, he falls ill. During a rabies--induced bout of madness, Tea Cake becomes convinced that Janie is cheating on him. He starts firing a pistol at her and Janie is forced to kill him to save her life. She is immediately put on trial for murder, but the all-white, all-male jury finds her not guilty. She returns to Eatonville where her former neighbors are ready to spin malicious gossip about her circumstances, assuming that Tea Cake has left her and taken her money. Janie wraps up her recounting to Pheoby, who is greatly impressed by Janie’s experiences. Back in her room that night, Janie feels at one with Tea Cake and at peace with herself."
Impoverished,"The full title of Swift's pamphlet is ""A Modest Proposal for Preventing the Children of Poor People from Being a Burthen to their Parents, or the Country, and for Making them Beneficial to the Publick."" The tract is an ironically conceived attempt to ""find out a fair, cheap, and easy Method"" for converting the starving children of Ireland into ""sound and useful members of the Commonwealth."" Across the country poor children, predominantly Catholics, are living in squalor because their families are too poor to keep them fed and clothed.
The author argues, by hard-edged economic reasoning as well as from a self-righteous moral stance, for a way to turn this problem into its own solution. His proposal, in effect, is to fatten up these undernourished children and feed them to Ireland's rich land-owners. Children of the poor could be sold into a meat market at the age of one, he argues, thus combating overpopulation and unemployment, sparing families the expense of child-bearing while providing them with a little extra income, improving the culinary experience of the wealthy, and contributing to the overall economic well-being of the nation.
The author offers statistical support for his assertions and gives specific data about the number of children to be sold, their weight and price, and the projected consumption patterns. He suggests some recipes for preparing this delicious new meat, and he feels sure that innovative cooks will be quick to generate more. He also anticipates that the practice of selling and eating children will have positive effects on family morality: husbands will treat their wives with more respect, and parents will value their children in ways hitherto unknown. His conclusion is that the implementation of this project will do more to solve Ireland's complex social, political, and economic problems than any other measure that has been proposed."
Revamp,"Alex Claremont-Diaz is the 21-year-old son of Ellen Claremont, the first female president of the United States. Alex is highly ambitious, with his sights set on a career in politics like his mother and his father, who is a US senator. Alex is finishing his last year of college and living in the White House with his family, including his older sister June. As the novel opens, June and Alex discuss the British royal wedding, which they are about to attend, and Alex talks about how much he hates the groom’s younger brother, Prince Henry. When Alex was 12, he used to look repeatedly at a photo of Henry from one of June’s teen magazines. But when he met Henry in person, Henry was rude to him, and he’s disliked Henry ever since. At the wedding, Alex is focused on Prince Henry and is irritated by everything he does, especially when he asks June to dance for a photo opportunity. Drunk, Alex confronts Henry for acting superior, and the two end up in a physical altercation that topples the $75,000 royal wedding cake. The international incident is a scandal, and Alex is forced to pretend to be Henry’s close friend to squash rumors of a shaky relationship between the United States and Britain. 
Alex has no choice but to go along with the plan. As Alex and Henry spend more time together, however, Alex is continually surprised by Henry and finds that Henry is not at all what he expected. He’s especially moved when he sees Henry speaking warmly and openly to a young girl with cancer. Before Alex can talk to Henry about it, there’s a loud noise like gunshots, and the two are rushed into a supply closet by security. In the closet, Henry ends up apologizing for mistreating Alex in the past and says he was cold to Alex because his father had just died. Alex and Henry exchange phone numbers and start texting and talking on the phone. The Claremont-Diaz clan has a family dinner, and Ellen offers both Alex and June positions in her reelection campaign. Alex is thrilled, but June, who wants to be a journalist, declines the offer. 
Alex, June, and their best friend Nora, who is the granddaughter of the Vice President, throw their annual New Year’s Eve party. Henry attends with his best friend Pez, who is enamored of June. Everyone is having fun together, but when Henry sees Alex and Nora kiss at midnight, he gets jealous and leaves the party. Alex finds him in the garden, and Henry kisses him for the first time. This spurs a crisis of sexual identity in Alex, who can’t stop thinking about the kiss. Though Alex has had a sexual relationship with his high school friend Liam and been attracted to men, he’s never considered himself bisexual. He talks to Nora about his confusion, and she says that Henry is gay, and that Alex seems to have feelings for Henry. When Henry flies in for a dinner, Alex kisses him while a security guard keeps watch. That night, they have sex for the first time, and Alex says they are friends with benefits. Henry and Alex continue to meet up to have sex when they can get away. They also begin to write flirtatious emails to each other and have heart-to-hearts on the phone. After a night on the town with June, Nora, Henry, Pez, and Henry’s sister Bea, Alex begins to develop feelings for Henry. 
Since Alex's mother is running for reelection and because Henry is a royal, it’s crucial that Henry and Alex’s relationship remain a secret. Alex often turns to his mentor and family friend, Senator Rafael Luna, for advice to help his mother with her campaign. It’s a blow to the whole family when Luna comes out as the running mate for Ellen’s opponent, Jeffrey Richards. Alex is devastated, and Henry comes to visit Alex at the Democratic National Convention to comfort him. The next morning, Zahra, Ellen’s chief of staff and family friend, catches Henry and Alex together and agrees to keep it a secret until after the convention. Alex comes out to his mother, who creates a PowerPoint presentation as a means of talking about the dangers of his relationship with Henry. She tells him she’ll support him, but he needs to be sure the relationship is forever. He goes to his family’s lake house with Henry, June, Nora, and his father Oscar. Alex comes out to his father, too, and he realizes that he is in love with Henry. Just as he’s about to tell Henry how he feels, Henry suddenly becomes formal and fake and leaves the conversation. The next morning Henry leaves the lake house without saying goodbye, leaving only a note. 
When Henry stops responding to Alex’s texts, Alex is distraught. He flies to London to confront Henry. Henry says he can’t be in a relationship with Alex because of the royal family. They have sex, and neither of them is sure whether it is a goodbye or the beginning of their relationship. Henry gives Alex his signet ring and says he wants to be with Alex. They are happy to be together, and they send each other passionate emails when they are apart.
Suspicions about their relationship start coming out in the press, so Alex and Henry pretend to go on dates with Nora and June. It’s painful for Henry to pretend to be someone he isn’t. Then, Akex and Henry's relationship is leaked to the press, with photos of them together and their entire email history. They are both forced to go on a communication blackout, and Ellen’s team attempts to triage the situation. Alex is miserable and worried about Henry. Eventually, he flies to London. Alex and Bea help Henry confront his family, including his grandmother, the Queen. As the Queen argues that the world will never accept them, a group of people gathers outside the palace to express support for Alex and Henry’s love.  
Nora, who has been missing since the news of Alex and Henry’s relationship broke, emerges and reveals that it was the Richards campaign that leaked their photographs and emails. Alex figures out that it was Luna who tipped them off. Alex talks to Luna, and Luna reveals that Richards sexually assaulted him when he was his intern. Luna joined the campaign to expose Richards as a sexual predator. Election night is tense, and in the end, whoever wins Texas, Ellen’s home state, will win the election. Ellen wins, and Henry joins Alex onstage for her victory lap. The two leave the party and go to Alex’s house. Alex shows Henry where he grew up, letting them in with the key he always wears around his neck."
Protection,"Two migrant workers, George and Lennie, have been let off a bus miles away from the California farm where they are due to start work. George is a small, dark man with “sharp, strong features.” Lennie, his companion, is his opposite, a giant of a man with a “shapeless” face. Overcome with thirst, the two stop in a clearing by a pool and decide to camp for the night. As the two converse, it becomes clear that Lennie has an intellectual disability, and is deeply devoted to George and dependent upon him for protection and guidance. George finds that Lennie, who loves petting soft things but often accidentally kills them, has been carrying and stroking a dead mouse. George angrily throws it away, fearing that Lennie might catch a disease from the dead animal. George complains loudly that his life would be easier without having to care for Lennie, but the reader senses that their friendship and devotion is mutual. He and Lennie share a dream of buying their own piece of land, farming it, and, much to Lennie’s delight, keeping rabbits. George ends the night by treating Lennie to the story he often tells him about what life will be like in such an idyllic place.
The next day, the men report to the nearby ranch. George, fearing how the boss will react to Lennie, insists that he’ll do all the talking. He lies, explaining that they travel together because they are cousins and that a horse kicked Lennie in the head when he was a child. They are hired. They meet Candy, an old “swamper,” or handyman, with a missing hand and an ancient dog, and Curley, the boss’s mean-spirited son. Curley is newly married, possessive of his flirtatious wife, and full of jealous suspicion. Once George and Lennie are alone in the bunkhouse, Curley’s wife appears and flirts with them. Lennie thinks she is “purty,” but George, sensing the trouble that could come from tangling with this woman and her husband, warns Lennie to stay away from her. Soon, the ranch-hands return from the fields for lunch, and George and Lennie meet Slim, the skilled mule driver who wields great authority on the ranch. Slim comments on the rarity of friendship like that between George and Lennie. Carlson, another ranch-hand, suggests that since Slim’s dog has just given birth, they should offer a puppy to Candy and shoot Candy’s old, good-for-nothing dog.
The next day, George confides in Slim that he and Lennie are not cousins, but have been friends since childhood. He tells how Lennie has often gotten them into trouble. For instance, they were forced to flee their last job because Lennie tried to touch a woman’s dress and was accused of rape. Slim agrees to give Lennie one of his puppies, and Carlson continues to badger Candy to kill his old dog. When Slim agrees with Carlson, saying that death would be a welcome relief to the suffering animal, Candy gives in. Carlson, before leading the dog outside, promises to do the job painlessly.
Slim goes to the barn to do some work, and Curley, who is maniacally searching for his wife, heads to the barn to accost Slim. Candy overhears George and Lennie discussing their plans to buy land, and offers his life’s savings if they will let him live there too. The three make a pact to let no one else know of their plan. Slim returns to the bunkhouse, berating Curley for his suspicions. Curley, searching for an easy target for his anger, finds Lennie and picks a fight with him. Lennie crushes Curley’s hand in the altercation. Slim warns Curley that if he tries to get George and Lennie fired, he will be the laughingstock of the farm.
The next night, most of the men go to the local brothel. Lennie is left with Crooks, the lonely, Black stable-hand, and Candy. Curley’s wife flirts with them, refusing to leave until the other men come home. She notices the cuts on Lennie’s face and suspects that he, and not a piece of machinery as Curley claimed, is responsible for hurting her husband. This thought amuses her. The next day, Lennie accidentally kills his puppy in the barn. Curley’s wife enters and consoles him. She admits that life with Curley is a disappointment, and wishes that she had followed her dream of becoming a movie star. Lennie tells her that he loves petting soft things, and she offers to let him feel her hair. When he grabs too tightly, she cries out. In his attempt to silence her, he accidentally breaks her neck.
Lennie flees back to a pool of the Salinas River that George had designated as a meeting place should either of them get into trouble. As the men back at the ranch discover what has happened and gather together a lynch party, George joins Lennie. Much to Lennie’s surprise, George is not mad at him for doing “a bad thing.” George begins to tell Lennie the story of the farm they will have together. As he describes the rabbits that Lennie will tend, the sound of the approaching lynch party grows louder. George shoots his friend in the back of the head.
When the other men arrive, George lets them believe that Lennie had the gun, and George wrestled it away from him and shot him. Only Slim understands what has really happened, that George has killed his friend out of mercy. Slim consolingly leads him away, and the other men, completely puzzled, watch them leave."
Prejudice,"The news that a wealthy young gentleman named Charles Bingley has rented the manor of Netherfield Park causes a great stir in the nearby village of Longbourn, especially in the Bennet household. The Bennets have five unmarried daughters—from oldest to youngest, Jane, Elizabeth, Mary, Kitty, and Lydia—and Mrs. Bennet is desperate to see them all married. After Mr. Bennet pays a social visit to Mr. Bingley, the Bennets attend a ball at which Mr. Bingley is present. He is taken with Jane and spends much of the evening dancing with her. His close friend, Mr. Darcy, is less pleased with the evening and haughtily refuses to dance with Elizabeth, which makes everyone view him as arrogant and obnoxious.
At social functions over subsequent weeks, however, Mr. Darcy finds himself increasingly attracted to Elizabeth’s charm and intelligence. Jane’s friendship with Mr. Bingley also continues to burgeon, and Jane pays a visit to the Bingley mansion. On her journey to the house she is caught in a downpour and catches ill, forcing her to stay at Netherfield for several days. In order to tend to Jane, Elizabeth hikes through muddy fields and arrives with a spattered dress, much to the disdain of the snobbish Miss Bingley, Charles Bingley’s sister. Miss Bingley’s spite only increases when she notices that Darcy, whom she is pursuing, pays quite a bit of attention to Elizabeth.
When Elizabeth and Jane return home, they find Mr. Collins visiting their household. Mr. Collins is a young clergyman who stands to inherit Mr. Bennet’s property, which has been “entailed,” meaning that it can only be passed down to male heirs. Mr. Collins is a pompous fool, though he is quite enthralled by the Bennet girls. Shortly after his arrival, he makes a proposal of marriage to Elizabeth. She turns him down, wounding his pride. Meanwhile, the Bennet girls have become friendly with militia officers stationed in a nearby town. Among them is Wickham, a handsome young soldier who is friendly toward Elizabeth and tells her how Darcy cruelly cheated him out of an inheritance.
At the beginning of winter, the Bingleys and Darcy leave Netherfield and return to London, much to Jane’s dismay. A further shock arrives with the news that Mr. Collins has become engaged to Charlotte Lucas, Elizabeth’s best friend and the poor daughter of a local knight. Charlotte explains to Elizabeth that she is getting older and needs the match for financial reasons. Charlotte and Mr. Collins get married and Elizabeth promises to visit them at their new home. As winter progresses, Jane visits the city to see friends (hoping also that she might see Mr. Bingley). However, Miss Bingley visits her and behaves rudely, while Mr. Bingley fails to visit her at all. The marriage prospects for the Bennet girls appear bleak.
That spring, Elizabeth visits Charlotte, who now lives near the home of Mr. Collins’s patron, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, who is also Darcy’s aunt. Darcy calls on Lady Catherine and encounters Elizabeth, whose presence leads him to make a number of visits to the Collins’s home, where she is staying. One day, he makes a shocking proposal of marriage, which Elizabeth quickly refuses. She tells Darcy that she considers him arrogant and unpleasant, then scolds him for steering Bingley away from Jane and disinheriting Wickham. Darcy leaves her but shortly thereafter delivers a letter to her. In this letter, he admits that he urged Bingley to distance himself from Jane, but claims he did so only because he thought their romance was not serious. As for Wickham, he informs Elizabeth that the young officer is a liar and that the real cause of their disagreement was Wickham’s attempt to elope with his young sister, Georgiana Darcy.
This letter causes Elizabeth to reevaluate her feelings about Darcy. She returns home and acts coldly toward Wickham. The militia is leaving town, which makes the younger, rather man-crazy Bennet girls distraught. Lydia manages to obtain permission from her father to spend the summer with an old colonel in Brighton, where Wickham’s regiment will be stationed. With the arrival of June, Elizabeth goes on another journey, this time with the Gardiners, who are relatives of the Bennets. The trip takes her to the North and eventually to the neighborhood of Pemberley, Darcy’s estate. She visits Pemberley, after making sure that Darcy is away, and delights in the building and grounds, while hearing from Darcy’s servants that he is a wonderful, generous master. Suddenly, Darcy arrives and behaves cordially toward her. Making no mention of his proposal, he entertains the Gardiners and invites Elizabeth to meet his sister.
Shortly thereafter, however, a letter arrives from home, telling Elizabeth that Lydia has eloped with Wickham and that the couple is nowhere to be found, which suggests that they may be living together out of wedlock. Fearful of the disgrace such a situation would bring on her entire family, Elizabeth hastens home. Mr. Gardiner and Mr. Bennet go off to search for Lydia, but Mr. Bennet eventually returns home empty-handed. Just when all hope seems lost, a letter comes from Mr. Gardiner saying that the couple has been found and that Wickham has agreed to marry Lydia in exchange for an annual income. The Bennets are convinced that Mr. Gardiner has paid off Wickham, but Elizabeth learns that the source of the money, and of her family’s salvation, was none other than Darcy.
Now married, Wickham and Lydia return to Longbourn briefly, where Mr. Bennet treats them coldly. They then depart for Wickham’s new assignment in the North of England. Shortly thereafter, Bingley returns to Netherfield and resumes his courtship of Jane. Darcy goes to stay with him and pays visits to the Bennets but makes no mention of his desire to marry Elizabeth. Bingley, on the other hand, presses his suit and proposes to Jane, to the delight of everyone but Bingley’s haughty sister. While the family celebrates, Lady Catherine de Bourgh pays a visit to Longbourn. She corners Elizabeth and says that she has heard that Darcy, her nephew, is planning to marry her. Since she considers a Bennet an unsuitable match for a Darcy, Lady Catherine demands that Elizabeth promise to refuse him. Elizabeth spiritedly refuses, saying she is not engaged to Darcy, but she will not promise anything against her own happiness. A little later, Elizabeth and Darcy go out walking together and he tells her that his feelings have not altered since the spring. She tenderly accepts his proposal, and both Jane and Elizabeth are married."
Recognizing,"At the age of four, Catalina de Erauso, born in the Basque area of Spain in 1585, is placed in a Dominican convent, where she trains until the age of fifteen to become a nun. On March 18, 1600, Catalina runs away from the convent and fashions herself a suit of male clothes out of her convent garments. Thus she begins her life as a man.
She obtains a number of jobs, including one as a page for the king’s secretary. While in his employ, she encounters her father, who is petitioning for help in finding his missing daughter. Her father does not recognize her. She again tempts fate and returns to her old convent for mass, where her mother is in attendance. Catalina’s mother also does not recognize her.
Catalina’s journeys through the New World begin when she meets her uncle, a sea captain who, not recognizing her, signs her on as a ship’s boy. Eventually Catalina flees the ship, stealing money from her uncle as she leaves for Panama, and embarks on a series of jobs and adventures. A number of violent episodes ensue, which often lead Catalina to flee into a local church for safety. At that time, police were barred from invading the sanctity of a church, thus granting criminals inside sanctuary. Catalina’s tendency to get into violent and criminal scrapes leads her to take frequent advantage of this legal loophole.
Catalina also has a number of problematic encounters with young ladies. Some want to marry her, forcing her to ward off their advances. But in one situation, Catalina is dismissed from her position for inappropriate behavior with the sister-in-law of her master. She signs up for the army and soon travels to Chile, where she becomes a soldier for her brother, who does not recognize her. Although they generally get along well, after three years they fight over a woman, and Catalina is banished to another town. She manages to distinguish herself in battle, both for her bravery and for her propensity for violence. She kills many people, both on and off the battlefield, and is constantly running from the law.
When a friend asks her to be his second in a duel, she agrees. During the course of the duel, she kills the other man’s second, who turns out to be her own brother. She retreats to the church to avoid arrest, and from there, wracked with sorrow, she watches her brother’s funeral. After months of hiding out in the church, Catalina leaves town and joins up with two other army deserters, who eventually die of starvation during their journey. Catalina is rescued by a half-Indian woman who wants Catalina to marry her daughter. At the same time, a local vicar tries to persuade her to marry his niece. Although she accepts their gifts, she eventually abandons them both.
Catalina assists in suppressing the Alonso Ibáñezi uprising and is part of a bloody battle where thousands of Indians are butchered. She is accused of committing a crime that she is innocent of, and although she is tortured, she refuses to admit to it. Soon after, she is accused of a murder that she actually has committed, but she refuses to admit to this crime either. She is nearly put to death until a fellow Basque halts the execution.
In Bolivia, the daughter of a nun begs Catalina to help her escape her husband, who is about to kill her for infidelity. The husband then tries to kill them both, but Catalina gets the woman to the safety of her mother’s convent. Catalina then goes to Peru to investigate crimes in the area. Soon after, she kills a man for insulting her and is sentenced to death. Due to a technicality in the church doctrine, she gains her freedom by taking communion and spitting it into her hand, holding onto the host until she is taken into a church, where she is granted sanctuary.
In Lima, she joins Spanish troops who are being attacked by the Dutch and then returns to the city of Cuzco, where she gets into a bloody fight over a game of cards. She kills her opponent, “the Cid,” who inflicts serious wounds on her as well. Thinking she is going to die, she makes a full confession to a priest.
Although she survives, she is wanted by the law. Her brushes with the constables grow more and more dangerous, and she is eventually surrounded by officers who have been given orders to kill her. A bishop intervenes and takes Catalina into the safety of his house. Catalina finally admits to the bishop that she is a woman, and when he expresses doubts, she gamely offers to submit to a medical examination. During the examination, she is proven to be not only a woman but a virgin, and the bishop vows to help her.
She is sent to a nunnery while the church investigates her past to find out if she ever took vows to become a nun. Her story spreads far and wide, and by 1620 she is well known throughout Spain. When, two years later, it is confirmed that she never took her vows, she is allowed to leave the convent and begin her life as a Spanish celebrity. She goes to Madrid and presents herself to the king, who, in 1625, grants her a pension for her service to Spain.
Catalina travels to Rome, where she meets Pope Urban the Eighth and tells him about her life and travels. She tells him that she is a woman and a virgin, and he gives her permission to continue to dress in men’s clothing.
Catalina ends her memoir with a short tale about being confronted by two prostitutes, whom she insults because they address her as a woman."
Gratifying,"Beloved begins in 1873 in Cincinnati, Ohio, where Sethe, a former slave, has been living with her eighteen-year-old daughter Denver. Sethe’s mother-in-law, Baby Suggs, lived with them until her death eight years earlier. Just before Baby Suggs’s death, Sethe’s two sons, Howard and Buglar, ran away. Sethe believes they fled because of the malevolent presence of an abusive ghost that has haunted their house at 124 Bluestone Road for years. Denver, however, likes the ghost, which everyone believes to be the spirit of her dead sister.
On the day the novel begins, Paul D, whom Sethe has not seen since they worked together on Mr. Garner’s Sweet Home plantation in Kentucky approximately twenty years earlier, stops by Sethe’s house. His presence resurrects memories that have lain buried in Sethe’s mind for almost two decades. From this point on, the story will unfold on two temporal planes. The present in Cincinnati constitutes one plane, while a series of events that took place around twenty years earlier, mostly in Kentucky, constitutes the other. This latter plane is accessed and described through the fragmented flashbacks of the major characters. Accordingly, we frequently read these flashbacks several times, sometimes from varying perspectives, with each successive narration of an event adding a little more information to the previous ones.
From these fragmented memories, the following story begins to emerge: Sethe, the protagonist, was born in the South to an African mother she never knew. When she is thirteen, she is sold to the Garners, who own Sweet Home and practice a comparatively benevolent kind of slavery. There, the other slaves, who are all men, lust after her but never touch her. Their names are Sixo, Paul D, Paul A, Paul F, and Halle. Sethe chooses to marry Halle, apparently in part because he has proven generous enough to buy his mother’s freedom by hiring himself out on the weekends. Together, Sethe and Halle have two sons, Howard and Buglar, as well as a baby daughter whose name we never learn. When she leaves Sweet Home, Sethe is also pregnant with a fourth child. After the eventual death of the proprietor, Mr. Garner, the widowed Mrs. Garner asks her sadistic, vehemently racist brother-in-law to help her run the farm. He is known to the slaves as schoolteacher, and his oppressive presence makes life on the plantation even more unbearable than it had been before. The slaves decide to run.
Schoolteacher and his nephews anticipate the slaves’ escape, however, and capture Paul D and Sixo. Schoolteacher kills Sixo and brings Paul D back to Sweet Home, where Paul D sees Sethe for what he believes will be the last time. She is still intent on running, having already sent her children ahead to her mother-in-law Baby Suggs’s house in Cincinnati. Invigorated by the recent capture, schoolteacher’s nephews seize Sethe in the barn and violate her, stealing the milk her body is storing for her infant daughter. Unbeknownst to Sethe, Halle is watching the event from a loft above her, where he lies frozen with horror. Afterward, Halle goes mad: Paul D sees him sitting by a churn with butter slathered all over his face. Paul D, meanwhile, is forced to suffer the indignity of wearing an iron bit in his mouth.
When schoolteacher finds out that Sethe has reported his and his nephews’ misdeeds to Mrs. Garner, he has her whipped severely, despite the fact that she is pregnant. Swollen and scarred, Sethe nevertheless runs away, but along the way she collapses from exhaustion in a forest. A white girl, Amy Denver, finds her and nurses her back to health. When Amy later helps Sethe deliver her baby in a boat, Sethe names this second daughter Denver after the girl who helped her. Sethe receives further help from Stamp Paid, who rows her across the Ohio River to Baby Suggs’s house. Baby Suggs cleans Sethe up before allowing her to see her three older children.
Sethe spends twenty-eight wonderful days in Cincinnati, where Baby Suggs serves as an unofficial preacher to the black community. On the last day, however, schoolteacher comes for Sethe to take her and her children back to Sweet Home. Rather than surrender her children to a life of dehumanizing slavery, she flees with them to the woodshed and tries to kill them. Only the third child, her older daughter, dies, her throat having been cut with a handsaw by Sethe. Sethe later arranges for the baby’s headstone to be carved with the word “Beloved.” The sheriff takes Sethe and Denver to jail, but a group of white abolitionists, led by the Bodwins, fights for her release. Sethe returns to the house at 124, where Baby Suggs has sunk into a deep depression. The community shuns the house, and the family continues to live in isolation.
Meanwhile, Paul D has endured torturous experiences in a chain gang in Georgia, where he was sent after trying to kill Brandywine, a slave owner to whom he was sold by schoolteacher. His traumatic experiences have caused him to lock away his memories, emotions, and ability to love in the “tin tobacco box” of his heart. One day, a fortuitous rainstorm allows Paul D and the other chain gang members to escape. He travels northward by following the blossoming spring flowers. Years later, he ends up on Sethe’s porch in Cincinnati.
Paul D’s arrival at 124 commences the series of events taking place in the present time frame. Prior to moving in, Paul D chases the house’s resident ghost away, which makes the already lonely Denver resent him from the start. Sethe and Paul D look forward to a promising future together, until one day, on their way home from a carnival, they encounter a strange young woman sleeping near the steps of 124. Most of the characters believe that the woman—who calls herself Beloved—is the embodied spirit of Sethe’s dead daughter, and the novel provides a wealth of evidence supporting this interpretation. Denver develops an obsessive attachment to Beloved, and Beloved’s attachment to Sethe is equally if not more intense. Paul D and Beloved hate each other, and Beloved controls Paul D by moving him around the house like a rag doll and by seducing him against his will.
When Paul D learns the story of Sethe’s “rough choice”—her infanticide—he leaves 124 and begins sleeping in the basement of the local church. In his absence, Sethe and Beloved’s relationship becomes more intense and exclusive. Beloved grows increasingly abusive, manipulative, and parasitic, and Sethe is obsessed with satisfying Beloved’s demands and making her understand why she murdered her. Worried by the way her mother is wasting away, Denver leaves the premises of 124 for the first time in twelve years in order to seek help from Lady Jones, her former teacher. The community provides the family with food and eventually organizes under the leadership of Ella, a woman who had worked on the Underground Railroad and helped with Sethe’s escape, in order to exorcise Beloved from 124. When they arrive at Sethe’s house, they see Sethe on the porch with Beloved, who stands smiling at them, naked and pregnant. Mr. Bodwin, who has come to 124 to take Denver to her new job, arrives at the house. Mistaking him for schoolteacher, Sethe runs at Mr. Bodwin with an ice pick. She is restrained, but in the confusion Beloved disappears, never to return.
Afterward, Paul D comes back to Sethe, who has retreated to Baby Suggs’s bed to die. Mourning Beloved, Sethe laments, “She was my best thing.” But Paul D replies, “You your best thing, Sethe.” The novel then ends with a warning that “[t]his is not a story to pass on.” The town, and even the residents of 124, have forgotten Beloved “[l]ike an unpleasant dream during a troubling sleep.”"
Allegations,"In the Puritan New England town of Salem, Massachusetts, a group of girls goes dancing in the forest with a black slave named Tituba. While dancing, they are caught by the local minister, Reverend Parris. One of the girls, Parris’s daughter Betty, falls into a coma-like state. A crowd gathers in the Parris home while rumors of witchcraft fill the town. Having sent for Reverend Hale, an expert on witchcraft, Parris questions Abigail Williams, the girls’ ringleader, about the events that took place in the forest. Abigail, who is Parris’s niece and ward, admits to doing nothing beyond “dancing.”
While Parris tries to calm the crowd that has gathered in his home, Abigail talks to some of the other girls, telling them not to admit to anything. John Proctor, a local farmer, then enters and talks to Abigail alone. Unbeknownst to anyone else in the town, while working in Proctor’s home the previous year she engaged in an affair with him, which led to her being fired by his wife, Elizabeth. Abigail still desires Proctor, but he fends her off and tells her to end her foolishness with the girls.
Betty wakes up and begins screaming. Much of the crowd rushes upstairs and gathers in her bedroom, arguing over whether she is bewitched. A separate argument between Proctor, Parris, the argumentative Giles Corey, and the wealthy Thomas Putnam soon ensues. This dispute centers on money and land deeds, and it suggests that deep fault lines run through the Salem community. As the men argue, Reverend Hale arrives and examines Betty, while Proctor departs. Hale quizzes Abigail about the girls’ activities in the forest, grows suspicious of her behavior, and demands to speak to Tituba. After Parris and Hale interrogate her for a brief time, Tituba confesses to communing with the devil, and she hysterically accuses various townsfolk of consorting with the devil. Suddenly, Abigail joins her, confessing to having seen the devil conspiring and cavorting with other townspeople. Betty joins them in naming witches, and the crowd is thrown into an uproar.
A week later, alone in their farmhouse outside of town, John and Elizabeth Proctor discuss the ongoing trials and the escalating number of townsfolk who have been accused of being witches. Elizabeth urges her husband to denounce Abigail as a fraud; he refuses, and she becomes jealous, accusing him of still harboring feelings for her. Mary Warren, their servant and one of Abigail’s circle, returns from Salem with news that Elizabeth has been accused of witchcraft but the court did not pursue the accusation. Mary is sent up to bed, and John and Elizabeth continue their argument, only to be interrupted by a visit from Reverend Hale. While they discuss matters, Giles Corey and Francis Nurse come to the Proctor home with news that their wives have been arrested. Officers of the court suddenly arrive and arrest Elizabeth. After they have taken her, Proctor browbeats Mary, insisting that she must go to Salem and expose Abigail and the other girls as frauds.
The next day, Proctor brings Mary to court and tells Judge Danforth that she will testify that the girls are lying. Danforth is suspicious of Proctor’s motives and tells Proctor, truthfully, that Elizabeth is pregnant and will be spared for a time. Proctor persists in his charge, convincing Danforth to allow Mary to testify. Mary tells the court that the girls are lying. When the girls are brought in, they turn the tables by accusing Mary of bewitching them. Furious, Proctor confesses his affair with Abigail and accuses her of being motivated by jealousy of his wife. To test Proctor’s claim, Danforth summons Elizabeth and asks her if Proctor has been unfaithful to her. Despite her natural honesty, she lies to protect Proctor’s honor, and Danforth denounces Proctor as a liar. Meanwhile, Abigail and the girls again pretend that Mary is bewitching them, and Mary breaks down and accuses Proctor of being a witch. Proctor rages against her and against the court. He is arrested, and Hale quits the proceedings.
The summer passes and autumn arrives. The witch trials have caused unrest in neighboring towns, and Danforth grows nervous. Abigail has run away, taking all of Parris’s money with her. Hale, who has lost faith in the court, begs the accused witches to confess falsely in order to save their lives, but they refuse. Danforth, however, has an idea: he asks Elizabeth to talk John into confessing, and she agrees. Conflicted, but desiring to live, John agrees to confess, and the officers of the court rejoice. But he refuses to incriminate anyone else, and when the court insists that the confession must be made public, Proctor grows angry, tears it up, and retracts his admission of guilt. Despite Hale’s desperate pleas, Proctor goes to the gallows with the others, and the witch trials reach their awful conclusion."
Exciting,"The Giver is written from the point of view of Jonas, an eleven-year-old boy living in a futuristic society that has eliminated all pain, fear, war, and hatred. There is no prejudice, since everyone looks and acts basically the same, and there is very little competition. Everyone is unfailingly polite. The society has also eliminated choice: at age twelve every member of the community is assigned a job based on his or her abilities and interests. Citizens can apply for and be assigned compatible spouses, and each couple is assigned exactly two children each. The children are born to Birthmothers, who never see them, and spend their first year in a Nurturing Center with other babies, or “newchildren,” born that year. When their children are grown, family units dissolve and adults live together with Childless Adults until they are too old to function in the society. Then they spend their last years being cared for in the House of the Old until they are finally “released” from the society. In the community, release is death, but it is never described that way; most people think that after release, flawed newchildren and joyful elderly people are welcomed into the vast expanse of Elsewhere that surrounds the communities. Citizens who break rules or fail to adapt properly to the society’s codes of behavior are also released, though in their cases it is an occasion of great shame. Everything is planned and organized so that life is as convenient and pleasant as possible.
Jonas lives with his father, a Nurturer of new children, his mother, who works at the Department of Justice, and his seven-year-old sister Lily. At the beginning of the novel, he is apprehensive about the upcoming Ceremony of Twelve, when he will be given his official Assignment as a new adult member of the community. He does not have a distinct career preference, although he enjoys volunteering at a variety of different jobs. Though he is a well-behaved citizen and a good student, Jonas is different: he has pale eyes, while most people in his community have dark eyes, and he has unusual powers of perception. Sometimes objects “change” when he looks at them. He does not know it yet, but he alone in his community can perceive flashes of color; for everyone else, the world is as devoid of color as it is of pain, hunger, and inconvenience.
At the Ceremony of Twelve, Jonas is given the highly honored Assignment of Receiver of Memory. The Receiver is the sole keeper of the community’s collective memory. When the community went over to Sameness—its painless, warless, and mostly emotionless state of tranquility and harmony—it abandoned all memories of pain, war, and emotion, but the memories cannot disappear totally. Someone must keep them so that the community can avoid making the mistakes of the past, even though no one but the Receiver can bear the pain. Jonas receives the memories of the past, good and bad, from the current Receiver, a wise old man who tells Jonas to call him the Giver.
The Giver transmits memories by placing his hands on Jonas’s bare back. The first memory he receives is of an exhilarating sled ride. As Jonas receives memories from the Giver—memories of pleasure and pain, of bright colors and extreme cold and warm sun, of excitement and terror and hunger and love—he realizes how bland and empty life in his community really is. The memories make Jonas’s life richer and more meaningful, and he wishes that he could give that richness and meaning to the people he loves. But in exchange for their peaceful existence, the people of Jonas’s community have lost the capacity to love him back or to feel deep passion about anything. Since they have never experienced real suffering, they also cannot appreciate the real joy of life, and the life of individual people seems less precious to them. In addition, no one in Jonas’s community has ever made a choice of his or her own. Jonas grows more and more frustrated with the members of his community, and the Giver, who has felt the same way for many years, encourages him. The two grow very close, like a grandfather and a grandchild might have in the days before Sameness, when family members stayed in contact long after their children were grown.
Meanwhile, Jonas is helping his family take care of a problem newchild, Gabriel, who has trouble sleeping through the night at the Nurturing Center. Jonas helps the child to sleep by transmitting soothing memories to him every night, and he begins to develop a relationship with Gabriel that mirrors the family relationships he has experienced through the memories. When Gabriel is in danger of being released, the Giver reveals to Jonas that release is the same as death. Jonas’s rage and horror at this revelation inspire the Giver to help Jonas devise a plan to change things in the community forever. The Giver tells Jonas about the girl who had been designated the new Receiver ten years before. She had been the Giver’s own daughter, but the sadness of some of the memories had been too much for her and she had asked to be released. When she died, all of the memories she had accumulated were released into the community, and the community members could not handle the sudden influx of emotion and sensation. The Giver and Jonas plan for Jonas to escape the community and to actually enter Elsewhere. Once he has done that, his larger supply of memories will disperse, and the Giver will help the community to come to terms with the new feelings and thoughts, changing the society forever.
However, Jonas is forced to leave earlier than planned when his father tells him that Gabriel will be released the next day. Desperate to save Gabriel, Jonas steals his father’s bicycle and a supply of food and sets off for Elsewhere. Gradually, he enters a landscape full of color, animals, and changing weather, but also hunger, danger, and exhaustion. Avoiding search planes, Jonas and Gabriel travel for a long time until heavy snow makes bike travel impossible. Half-frozen, but comforting Gabriel with memories of sunshine and friendship, Jonas mounts a high hill. There he finds a sled—the sled from his first transmitted memory—waiting for him at the top. Jonas and Gabriel experience a glorious downhill ride on the sled. Ahead of them, they see—or think they see—the twinkling lights of a friendly village at Christmas, and they hear music. Jonas is sure that someone is waiting for them there."
Arduous,"Marjane “Marji” Satrapi is an intelligent, spirited, and very modern girl living with her parents in Iran’s capital of Tehran during the eventful period of Iranian history from the late 1970s into the early 1980s. In Persepolis: The Story of a Childhood, Marji’s remembers her life during those years, mostly from when she was about ten to age fourteen. This account includes how Marji and her family lived through and were affected by turbulent events that included the overthrow of the autocratic Shah of Iran by the Islamic revolution, the oppressive fundamentalist regime that replaced the Shah, and the devasting Iran-Iraq war.
The nation’s wealth has long made it a target of outside invaders, but Islamic revolution of 1979 has pushed out the Western-backed government of the Shah.  The revolution has ushered in a new Islamic regime that is bringing massive societal changes impacting how people are supposed to behave--including Marji and her family. Marji struggles to adjust to the changes at her liberal French bilingual school, which has become increasingly stricter. Girls are required to wear veils and female and male students are now separated. Marji’s wealthy and modern parents—her father, Ebi, and her mother, Taji—take part in the massive protests against the new regime’s strict rules on behavior (just as they had previously protested against the Shah’s regime). Marji’s parents worry when a photo of Marji’s mother a protest appears in newspapers magazines. Later, after a demonstration they are at turns violent, the Satrapis decide that openly protesting is too dangerous to continue to do.
Marji feels conflict between her own deeply spiritual feelings and the stark modernism of her parents. She talks to God at night and has believed she will become a prophet one day since she was six years old, Marji. But the revolution leads to Marji setting aside these ambitions while she studies and imitates protestors and revolutionaries. She mimics protestors in the garden of her house and studies books about famous revolutionaries and philosophers given to her by her parents. She fantasizes about becoming a hero and wants her parents to become heroes too. Marji’s relationship with God becomes strained, as she finds that she and God have less to talk about—although God does still come by to see her from time to time.
Marji thrills when she learns that rebels fill her family history. She learns that her grandfather was a prince and later a communist whom the Shah removed from power and that her uncle Anoosh, also a communist, spent nine years in prison during the Shah’s regime. Marji spends a short time with Anoosh, learning about his life. After the Shah fell from power in 1979, Anoosh was released from prison, but when Islamic fundamentalists consolidate their grip on power, they hunt Anoosh down, imprison him, and later execute him. Her new idol killed, Marji feels crushed. She completely abandons her faith in God and increasingly questions the pro-regime propaganda she hears—especially at school.
Marji deeply loves and identifies with of her parents, even if she does sometimes feel that their actions and behavior (as wealthy and privileged individuals) do not always live up to their pro-democratic and liberal rhetoric. Marji also has a special connection with her grandmother, who remains stoic and inspiring to Marji in spite of the turmoil and numerous tragedies stemming from political actions that impact her and the family. Marji’s uncle Anoosh is not Marji’s only direct experience with the cruel consequences of the government’s actions. Throughout the book, death and devastation occurs among Marji’s extended family and friends as direct results of the brutality and fanaticism of the Iranian regimes and the war with Iraq.
People had rejoiced when the Shah was forced out, but as Islamic fundamentalists retain power, Marji and her family watch as their neighbors’ behavior shifts back and forth to coincide with the current political winds. The neighbors go from wearing short skirts and drinking alcohol to covering themselves and denouncing the use of alcohol. Marji’s parents ask her to tell everyone that she prays every day, a lie they hope will keep Marji safe, but acknowledge that the rules seem foolish. Marji grows more rebellious, as she increasingly views the rules at school and elsewhere as hypocritical and difficult to follow. Armed with more knowledge and personal experience, Marji begins to act out in ways that put her safety at risk. In fact, she even (accidentally) hits her principal during an argument, which results in her expulsion from school. Fearing her rebellious behavior will get her killed, Marji’s mother tries to reason with Marji by telling her that it is not her responsibility to serve justice and that the bad guys eventually pay for their sins in the end.
The war with Iraq had originally inspired Marji to vocal patriotism in protection her country against another invasion, but Marji begins to realize there are greater forces behind the war. She sees how the Islamic regime needs the war to continue survive and keep power. The war promotes a sense of nationalism and pride in the public, and those who die in the war are hailed as “martyrs.” Marji sees thousands of poor boys lured into war without proper training. She becomes increasingly uncomfortable and aware of class differences within society. Poor young boys are lured into the army with gold-painted keys to the “kingdom of heaven” to help them enter paradise after dying on the battlefield, while children in her wealthy neighborhood are left alone.
More and more people try to escape Iran as the borders tighten and Iraqi forces bomb Tehran and other Iranian cities. Realizing that Marji’s chances of escaping Iran are narrowing, her parents make the difficult decision to send her abroad alone to finish school in Vienna, explaining that only a good education will free her of Iran. Marji feels heartbroken. She spends one last night with her grandmother, who gives her warm advice and inspires her to be compassionate and understanding while in Vienna. Marji gives away all of her prized contraband to her friends, including a Kim Wilde poster. At the airport, as Marji turns to say goodbye to her parents one last time to see that her mother, devasted by her only child’s departure, has fainted."
Covers,"In a series of vignettes, The House on Mango Street covers a year in the life of Esperanza, a Chicana (Mexican-American girl), who is about twelve years old when the novel begins. During the year, she moves with her family into a house on Mango Street. The house is a huge improvement from the family’s previous apartment, and it is the first home her parents actually own. However, the house is not what Esperanza has dreamed of, because it is run-down and small. The house is in the center of a crowded Latino neighborhood in Chicago, a city where many of the poor areas are racially segregated. Esperanza does not have any privacy, and she resolves that she will someday leave Mango Street and have a house all her own.
Esperanza matures significantly during the year, both sexually and emotionally. The novel charts her life as she makes friends, grows hips, develops her first crush, endures sexual assault, and begins to write as a way of expressing herself and as a way to escape the neighborhood. The novel also includes the stories of many of Esperanza’s neighbors, giving a full picture of the neighborhood and showing the many possible paths Esperanza may follow in the future.
After moving to the house, Esperanza quickly befriends Lucy and Rachel, two Chicana girls who live across the street. Lucy, Rachel, Esperanza, and Esperanza’s little sister, Nenny, have many adventures in the small space of their neighborhood. They buy a bike, learn exciting stories about boys from a young woman named Marin, explore a junk shop, and have intimate conversations while playing Double Dutch (jumping rope). The girls are on the brink of puberty and sometimes find themselves sexually vulnerable, such as when they walk around their neighborhood in high-heeled shoes or when Esperanza is kissed by an older man at her first job. During the first half of the year, the girls are content to live and play in their child’s world. At school, Esperanza feels ashamed about her family’s poverty and her difficult-to-pronounce name. She secretly writes poems that she shares only with older women she trusts.
Over the summer, Esperanza slips into puberty. She suddenly likes it when boys watch her dance, and she enjoys dreaming about them. Esperanza’s newfound sexual maturity, combined with the death of two of her family members, her grandfather and her Aunt Lupe, bring her closer to the world of adults. She begins to closely watch the women in her neighborhood. This second half of The House on Mango Street presents a string of stories about older women in the neighborhood, all of whom are even more stuck in their situations and, quite literally, in their houses, than Esperanza is. Meanwhile, during the beginning of the following school year, Esperanza befriends Sally, a girl her age who is more sexually mature than Lucy or Rachel. Sally, meanwhile, has her own agenda. She uses boys and men as an escape route from her abusive father. Esperanza is not completely comfortable with Sally’s sexual experience, and their friendship results in a crisis when Sally leaves Esperanza alone, and a group of boys sexually assaults Esperanza in her absence.
Esperanza’s traumatic experiences as Sally’s friend, in conjunction with her detailed observations of the older women in her neighborhood, cement her desire to escape Mango Street and to have her own house. When Esperanza finds herself emotionally ready to leave her neighborhood, however, she discovers that she will never fully be able to leave Mango Street behind, and that after she leaves she’ll have to return to help the women she has left. At the end of the year, Esperanza remains on Mango Street, but she has matured extensively. She has a stronger desire to leave and understands that writing will help her put distance between herself and her situation. Though for now writing helps her escape only emotionally, in the future it may help her to escape physically as well."
Signifying,"The Lightning Thief follows the story of young Percy Jackson, a troubled 12-year-old boy with a secret unknown even to himself. Diagnosed with dyslexia and ADHD, while being raised primarily by his mother, his life so far has not always been easy. Percy is repeatedly kicked out of school due to unexplainable events that aren’t really his fault. While on a sixth-grade field trip to a museum, Percy faces his strangest event yet. After an argument with a school bully, his math teacher, Mrs. Dodds, draws Percy aside to punish him. Mrs. Dodds suddenly transforms into a monster and attacks him. His favorite teacher, Mr. Brunner, rescues Percy by throwing him a ballpoint pen that changes into a sword. 
Although Percy defeats Mrs. Dodds, when he reunites with his other classmates, no one remembers her. In response, Percy acts out and is expelled from school. Percy overhears a conversation between Mr. Brunner and his friend Grover regarding Percy’s impending future, so he seeks answers from Grover on the bus ride home. After the bus breaks down, Percy and Grover notice three old women across the street knitting. One of the women cuts a string, which Percy and Grover discuss as signifying death. 
At home, Percy escapes his dreadful stepfather, whom he calls Smelly Gabe, by joining his mother, Sally, on a trip to their favorite beach where she originally met his birth father. Forceful winds and an unexpected visit from Grover lead Percy to reveal to his mother the incident that happened with Mrs. Dodds. After Percy finishes his story, Sally instructs Grover and Percy to get into the car where Percy notices Grover has hooves for feet and learns his friend is a satyr. Sally insists that Percy must go to a special camp for his safety. A monster chases after their car as they head in that direction, attacking Percy’s mother, which causes her to disappear into a golden light. Enraged, and fearing his mother’s death, Percy defeats the monster and obtains one of its horns as a souvenir. 
Percy arrives at Camp Half-Blood and meets Mr. D, the god of wine, and Chiron, a centaur, formerly known as Mr. Brunner, Percy’s Latin teacher. Chiron and Grover explain to Percy that he is a half-blood, or a demi-god, meaning that he is half mortal and half god. Since his godly parent is unknown, Percy is assigned the cabin dedicated to Hermes. At camp, Percy meets Annabeth, the daughter of Athena; his cabin counselor Luke, the son of Hermes; and Clarisse, the daughter of Ares. An altercation with Clarisse allows Percy to discover his father is Poseidon, one of the “Big Three” gods. This revelation is cut short when a hellhound attacks Percy from the Fields of Punishment. Chiron protects everyone at the camp by sending Percy off on a special quest to save the world.  
Percy’s Oracle reveals that Zeus has accused Poseidon of stealing his lightning bolt and requires Poseidon’s son to return it before the summer solstice. Chiron believes Hades actually stole the bolt to start a war between the gods. Percy chooses Grover and Annabeth to accompany him on his quest and together they head west to the entrance of the Underworld to confront Hades on the missing bolt. Along the way, the three will face several monsters before making it to Hades’ house. 
On one part of their journey, Percy and his friends fight the Furies, which causes the bus they are on to explode. After escaping into nearby woods, they come across a shop filled with many life-size statues. They meet Aunty Em, who Annabeth later identifies as Medusa. Percy defeats Medusa and sends her head to Olympus to show that he’s not a pawn in the gods’ game. Annabeth, Percy, and Grover take a train to Denver but stop at an Arch during a layover where Percy encounters the monsters Echidna and Chimera. He jumps off the Arch into the river to avoid dying and is met by a spirit who tells him to go to Santa Monica before going to the Underworld. 
In Denver, Percy, Annabeth, and Grover meet Ares, the god of war, who requests their help in retrieving his shield in exchange for information on Percy’s mother. Despite facing a trap placed by Hephaestus, Aphrodite’s husband, the three successfully grab the shield and return it to Ares who tells Percy that his mother is still alive. Ares gives the trio a backpack of supplies and safe transportation to Nevada.  
Percy and his friends continue west but lose track of time in a magical casino in Las Vegas, which leaves them only one more day to find and return the master bolt. Percy, Annabeth, and Grover arrive in Santa Monica where Percy receives three pearls from the same spirit who visited him in the river. The three search for directions to the Underworld and encounter a monster named Crusty. Percy defeats this monster and finds the address to an entrance to the Underworld. 
In the Underworld, Percy barters with Charon, a security officer, to let them in and tries to distract Cerberus, a three-headed security Rottweiler, but Annabeth is able to successfully command him. While on their way to Hades’ house, Grover’s flying shoes, on loan from Luke, pull him toward a pit Percy has dreamed uneasily about. Luckily, the shoes fall off before Grover reaches the pit. Finally, at the house, Hades accuses Percy of stealing his Helm of Darkness as well as the master bolt that surprisingly appears in the backpack Percy received from Ares. Hades reveals Percy’s mother to him in a golden light and says she will be returned once his helm is retrieved. Percy denies the allegations but after Hades threatens to kill his mother and unleash the dead back into the world, he agrees to find and return the helm. 
Percy, Grover, and Annabeth escape the Underworld and arrive in Santa Monica with the help of the magical pearls. They realize they have been manipulated by Ares and Percy confronts him about stealing the bolt and the helm. The two engage in battle. Percy defeats Ares after stabbing him in the heel. Rather than continue fighting, Ares accepts defeat but points out that Percy has made a new enemy. The Furies appear and return the Helm of Darkness to Hades while Percy, Annabeth, and Grover head to Olympus to return the bolt to Zeus.
 
Percy returns the bolt to Zeus on Mount Olympus and meets his father, Poseidon. Percy informs them of his quest and shares his concerns about the mysterious pit, but Zeus dismisses the conversation. He rewards Percy by sparing his life. Before returning home, Percy has a brief conversation with Poseidon about his mother who is safely back home. Percy learns that he has a decision to make regarding a package Poseidon has sent back to him. At home, Percy shares the details of his quest with his mother and discovers that the package with Medusa’s head has been returned to him. Before leaving for camp, he encourages his mother to use it on Smelly Gabe. 
Percy returns to Camp Half-Blood for the rest of the summer. While there, he learns his mother used Medusa to turn Smelly Gabe into a statue as she no longer needs to put up with him to keep Percy safe. She sells the statue and uses some of the money to enroll Percy in a new private school for the fall. Before the end of the summer, Percy learns that Luke was really the one responsible for stealing the master bolt and the Helm of Darkness in order to serve Kronos, a Titan and the father of Zeus. After Chiron tells Percy justice will be restored when the time is right, Percy makes plans to confront Luke the following summer."
Instructive,"Siddhartha, the handsome and respected son of a Brahmin, lives with his father in ancient India. Everyone in the village expects Siddhartha to be a successful Brahmin like his father. Siddhartha enjoys a near-idyllic existence with his best friend, Govinda, but he is secretly dissatisfied. He performs all the rituals of religion, and he does what religion says should bring him happiness and peace. Nonetheless, he feels something is missing. His father and the other elders have still not achieved enlightenment, and he feels that staying with them will not settle the questions he has about the nature of his existence. Siddhartha believes his father has already passed on all the wisdom their community has to offer, but he longs for something more. 
One day, a group of wandering ascetics called Samanas passes through town. They are starved and almost naked and have come to beg for food. They believe enlightenment can be reached through asceticism, a rejection of the body and physical desire. The path the Samanas preach is quite different from the one Siddhartha has been taught, and he believes it may provide some of the answers he is looking for. He decides to follow this new path. Siddhartha’s father does not want him to join the Samanas, but he cannot dissuade Siddhartha. Govinda also wants to find a path to enlightenment, and he joins Siddhartha in this new life.
	Siddhartha adjusts quickly to the ways of the Samanas because of the patience and discipline he learned in the Brahmin tradition. He learns how to free himself from the traditional trappings of life, and so loses his desire for property, clothing, sexuality, and all sustenance except that required to live. His goal is to find enlightenment by eliminating his Self, and he successfully renounces the pleasures of the world. 
Sunburned and half-starved, Siddhartha soon ceases to resemble the boy he used to be. Govinda is quick to praise the Samanas and notes the considerable moral and spiritual improvements they both have achieved since joining. Siddhartha, however, is still dissatisfied. The path of self-denial does not provide a permanent solution for him. He points out that the oldest Samanas have lived the life for many years but have yet to attain true spiritual enlightenment. The Samanas have been as unsuccessful as the Brahmins Siddhartha and Govinda left behind. At this time, Siddhartha and the other Samanas begin to hear about a new holy man named Gotama the Buddha who has attained the total spiritual enlightenment called Nirvana. Govinda convinces Siddhartha they both should leave the Samanas and seek out Gotama. Siddhartha and Govinda inform the leader of the Samanas of their decision to leave. The leader is clearly displeased, but Siddhartha silences him with an almost magical, hypnotizing gaze. 
Siddhartha and Govinda find Gotama’s camp of followers and are taken in. Siddhartha is initially pleased with Gotama, and he and Govinda are instructed in the Eightfold Path, the four main points, and other aspects of Buddhism. However, while Govinda is convinced to join Gotama and his followers, Siddhartha still has doubts. He has noticed a contradiction in Gotama’s teachings: Siddhartha questions how one can embrace the unity of all things, as the Buddha asks, if they are also being told to overcome the physical world. Siddhartha realizes Buddhism will not give him the answers he needs. Sadly, he leaves Govinda behind and begins a search for the meaning of life, the achievement of which he feels will not be dependent on religious instruction. 
	Siddhartha decides to embark on a life free from meditation and the spiritual quests he has been pursuing, and to instead learn from the pleasures of the body and the material world. In his new wanderings, Siddhartha meets a friendly ferryman, fully content with his simple life. Siddhartha crosses the ferryman’s river and comes to a city. Here, a beautiful courtesan named Kamala entrances him. He knows she would be the best one to teach him about the world of love, but Kamala will not have him unless he proves he can fit into the material world. She convinces him to take up the path of the merchant. With her help, Siddhartha soon finds employment with a merchant named Kamaswami and begins to learn the trade. While Siddhartha learns the wisdom of the business world and begins to master the skills Kamaswami teaches him, Kamala becomes his lover and teaches him what she knows about love.
	Years pass, and Siddhartha’s business acumen increases. Soon, he is a rich man and enjoys the benefits of an affluent life. He gambles, drinks, and dances, and anything that can be bought in the material world is his for the taking. Siddhartha is detached from this life, however, and he can never see it as more than a game. He doesn’t care if he wins or loses this game because it doesn’t touch his spirit in any lasting way. The more he obtains in the material world, the less it satisfies him, and he is soon caught in a cycle of unhappiness that he tries to escape by engaging in even more gambling, drinking, and sex. When he is at his most disillusioned, he dreams that Kamala’s rare songbird is dead in its cage. He understands that the material world is slowly killing him without providing him with the enlightenment for which he has been searching. One night, he resolves to leave it all behind and departs without notifying either Kamala or Kamaswami. 
Sick at heart, Siddhartha wanders until he finds a river. He considers drowning himself, but he instead falls asleep on the riverbank. While he is sleeping, Govinda, who is now a Buddhist monk, passes by. Not recognizing Siddhartha, he watches over the sleeping man to protect him from snakes. Siddhartha immediately recognizes Govinda when he wakes up, but Govinda notes that Siddhartha has changed significantly from his days with the Samanas and now appears to be a rich man. Siddhartha responds that he is currently neither a Samana nor a rich man. Siddhartha wishes to become someone new. Govinda soon leaves to continue on his journey, and Siddhartha sits by the river and considers where his life has taken him. 
	Siddhartha seeks out the same content ferryman he met years before. The ferryman, who introduces himself as Vasudeva, radiates an inner peace that Siddhartha wishes to attain. Vasudeva says he himself has attained this sense of peace through many years of studying the river. Siddhartha expresses a desire to likewise learn from the river, and Vasudeva agrees to let Siddhartha live and work beside him. Siddhartha studies the river and begins to take from it a spiritual enlightenment unlike any he has ever known. While sitting by the river, he contemplates the unity of all life, and in the river’s voice he hears the word Om. 

	One day Kamala the courtesan approaches the ferry along with her son on a pilgrimage to visit Gotama, who is said to be dying. Before they can cross, a snake bites Kamala. Siddhartha and Vasudeva tend to Kamala, but the bite kills her. Before she dies, she tells Siddhartha that he is the father of her eleven-year-old son. Siddhartha does his best to console and provide for his son, but the boy is spoiled and cynical. Siddhartha’s son dislikes life with the two ferrymen and wishes to return to his familiar city and wealth. Vasudeva believes Siddhartha’s son should be allowed to leave if he wants to, but Siddhartha is not ready to let him go. One morning, Siddhartha awakens to find his son has run away and stolen all of his and Vasudeva’s money. Siddhartha chases after the boy, but as he reaches the city he realizes the chase is futile. Vasudeva follows Siddhartha and brings him back to their home by the river, instructing him to soothe the pain of losing his son by listening to the river.
	Siddhartha studies the river for many years, and Vasudeva teaches Siddhartha how to learn the many secrets the river has to tell. In contemplating the river, Siddhartha has a revelation: Just as the water of the river flows into the ocean and is returned by rain, all forms of life are interconnected in a cycle without beginning or end. Birth and death are all part of a timeless unity. Life and death, joy and sorrow, good and evil are all parts of the whole and are necessary to understand the meaning of life. By the time Siddhartha has learned all the river’s lessons, Vasudeva announces that he is through with his life at the river. He retires into the forest, leaving Siddhartha to be the ferryman.
	The novel ends with Govinda returning to the river to seek enlightenment by meeting with a wise man who lives there. When Govinda arrives, he does not recognize that the wise man is Siddhartha himself. Govinda is still a follower of Gotama but has yet to attain the kind of enlightenment that Siddhartha now radiates, and he asks Siddhartha to teach him what he knows. Siddhartha explains that neither he nor anyone can teach the wisdom to Govinda, because verbal explanations are limited and can never communicate the entirety of enlightenment. Instead, he asks Govinda to kiss him on the forehead, and when Govinda does, the vision of unity that Siddhartha has experienced is communicated instantly to Govinda. Govinda and Siddhartha have both finally achieved the enlightenment they set out to find in the days of their youth."
Shows,"Maus: A Survivor’s Tale is the illustrated true story of Vladek Spiegelman’s experiences during World War II, as told by his son, Artie. It consists of Book One: My Father Bleeds History, and Book Two: And Here My Troubles Began / From Mauschwitz to the Catskills and Beyond.
While the story is primarily focused on Vladek’s life, there is also a frame narrative (or, a story within the story) that shows Artie and his father interacting in the present, with Artie asking questions as Vladek relays his experiences. As Vladek describes the horrors that he faced as a Jewish person in World War II, there are interspersed scenes that reveal some of the challenges that Artie faces as the son of a concentration camp survivor. For example, Vladek is obsessive about money and constantly fusses over Artie’s clothes, decisions, and refusal to eat everything on his plate (even though Artie is an adult).
Except for a brief scene that depicts Artie as a human wearing a mouse mask, all of the people in the story appear as anthropomorphic animals. Jews are depicted as mice, Germans as cats, Poles as pigs, French as frogs, and Americans as dogs.
The story begins around 1978, with Artie visiting his father Vladek in New York City. Vladek looks frail and unhealthy; he’s had two heart attacks, and the suicide of his wife Anja (Artie’s mother) a decade earlier has taken a serious toll on him. Vladek is remarried to a woman named Mala with whom he constantly argues. Artie asks Vladek to tell him stories about life during World War II so that he can create a comic book based on Vladek’s experiences. 
Vladek starts his story in 1935, when he was living in Poland. After marrying Anja Zylberberg, Vladek moves to Sosnowiec, Poland, where her wealthy family helps them get established. Vladek and Anja have a son named Richieu, and Anja’s father, a millionaire, gives Vladek money to buy a factory in Bielsko. Vladek runs the factory during the week and returns home to Sosnowiec on the weekends to visit Anja and Richieu. Anja has a breakdown due to severe postpartum depression, and Vladek stays with her in a sanitarium in Czechoslovakia until she recovers. In 1939, Vladek is drafted into the Polish army and sent to the frontlines to fight the Nazis, where he is captured and becomes a prisoner of war. Vladek is eventually released back to Poland, and he returns to Anja and Richieu in Sosnoweic.
As the war continues, the Nazis begin rounding up Jewish people in Sosnowiec and sending them away on trains. Food and resources become scarce, and Vladek begins trading goods on the black market in order to provide for his family. Several of his friends are caught trading goods and executed. The Nazis later order that everyone report to the local stadium to have their papers verified; once there, many Jews are taken away for deportation. Luckily, Vladek’s cousin is working one of the tables at the stadium, and he is able to secure Vladek’s release, as well as Anja’s and her parents’. Vladek’s sister Fela, Fela’s four children, and Vladek’s father are not as fortunate—they are never seen again.
During one of Artie’s visits to help his father and record his stories about World War II, he finds out that his father read a comic he drew years before. The comic, Prisoner on the Hell Planet: A Case History, is included in Maus. It depicts Artie as a prisoner and shows the mental and emotional pain he endured because of his mother’s suicide in 1968.
Continuing on with his story, Vladek says that after leaving the stadium, he and his family were relocated to a ghetto in Srodula. In order to keep Richieu safe, Vladek and Anja send him to live with Anja’s sister Tosha in Zawiercie. They later find out that when Tosha discovered that she and the rest of the Jews in Zawiercie were going to be shipped to Auschwitz, she poisoned Richieu, herself, and her two children in order to spare them a worse fate at the camp.
When Vladek and Anja realize that the Germans are going to send everyone in the ghetto to concentration camps, they go into hiding to avoid capture. Once the ghetto is empty, Vladek and Anja begin to walk back to Sosnowiec. Along the way, they secure passage to Hungary with some smugglers, but the smugglers betray them and hand them over to the Germans. Vladek is sent to Auschwitz, and Anja is taken to Birkenau.
Vladek tells Artie that Anja kept diaries after the war, but Vladek destroyed them in a fit of grief. Artie becomes upset and yells at his father, saying that they would have had valuable information in them. At the beginning of Book Two, while Artie is staying with friends in Vermont, he receives a call from Vladek: Mala has left him and taken some of their shared valuables. Fearing that he will be responsible for taking care of his father, Artie goes to visit him in New York.
Vladek continues his story and describes the terrible conditions in Auschwitz. While working there, he uses his knowledge of trade skills to remain valuable and avoid execution. He learns that Anja is in the secondary camp, Auschwitz Birkenau, and arranges to do some repairs there so that he can see her. After hoarding the few resources available, Vladek bribes some of the Nazi guards to have Anja relocated to his camp to work in the munitions shop.
Vladek continues his story, describing the various ways that he used his skills and resourcefulness to help himself and Anja survive at Auschwitz. As the Russian army closes in on Auschwitz, Vladek is tasked with dismantling the gas chambers. All of the prisoners are eventually evacuated and relocated to Dachau, a camp in Germany. Vladek contracts typhus from the lice at Dachau and becomes very sick. He is sent toward Switzerland by train to be traded as a prisoner of war and is eventually rescued by American soldiers. After traveling back through Germany to Poland, he is reunited with Anja.
When Artie visits his father to hear the last of the story, Vladek is very sick. Mala has returned to help, but is still frustrated by Vladek. When Artie starts to leave, Vladek, confused and tired, calls him Richieu."
Sweeping,"Gregor Samsa, a traveling salesman, wakes up in his bed to find himself transformed into a large insect. He looks around his room, which appears normal, and decides to go back to sleep to forget about what has happened. He attempts to roll over, only to discover that he cannot due to his new body—he is stuck on his hard, convex back. He tries to scratch an itch on his stomach, but when he touches himself with one of his many new legs, he is disgusted. He reflects on how dreary life as a traveling salesman is and how he would quit if his parents and sister did not depend so much on his income. He turns to the clock and sees that he has overslept and missed his train to work.
Gregor’s mother knocks on the door, and when he answers her, Gregor finds that his voice has changed. His family suspects that he may be ill, so they ask him to open the door, which he keeps locked out of habit. He tries to get out of bed, but he cannot maneuver his transformed body. While struggling to move, he hears his office manager come into the family’s apartment to find out why Gregor has not shown up to work. He eventually rocks himself to the floor and calls out that he will open the door momentarily.
Through the door, the office manager warns Gregor of the consequences of missing work and hints that Gregor’s recent work has not been satisfactory. Gregor protests and tells the office manager that he will be there shortly. Neither his family nor the office manager can understand what Gregor says, and they suspect that something may be seriously wrong with him. Gregor manages to unlock and open the door with his mouth, since he has no hands. He begs the office manager’s forgiveness for his late start. Horrified by Gregor’s appearance, the office manager bolts from the apartment. Gregor tries to catch up with the fleeing office manager, but his father drives him back into the bedroom with a cane and a rolled newspaper. Gregor injures himself squeezing back through the doorway, and his father slams the door shut. Gregor, exhausted, falls asleep.
Gregor wakes and sees that someone has put milk and bread in his room. Initially excited, he quickly discovers that he has no taste for milk, once one of his favorite foods. He settles himself under a couch and listens to the quiet apartment. The next morning, his sister Grete comes in, sees that he has not touched the milk, and replaces it with rotting food scraps, which Gregor happily eats. This begins a routine in which his sister feeds him and cleans up while he hides under the couch, afraid that his appearance will frighten her. Gregor spends his time listening through the wall to his family members talking. They often discuss the difficult financial situation they find themselves in now that Gregor can’t provide for them. Gregor also learns that his mother wants to visit him, but his sister and father will not let her.
Gregor grows more comfortable with his changed body. He begins climbing the walls and ceiling for amusement. Discovering Gregor’s new pastime, Grete decides to remove some of the furniture to give Gregor more space. She and her mother begin taking furniture away, but Gregor finds their actions deeply distressing. He tries to save a picture on the wall of a woman wearing a fur hat, fur scarf, and a fur muff. Gregor’s mother sees him hanging on the wall and passes out. Grete calls out to Gregor—the first time anyone has spoken directly to him since his transformation. Gregor runs out of the room and into the kitchen. His father returns from his new job, and misunderstanding the situation, believes Gregor has tried to attack the mother. The father throws apples at Gregor, and one sinks into his back and remains lodged there. Gregor manages to get back into his bedroom but is severely injured.
Gregor’s family begins leaving the bedroom door open for a few hours each evening so he can watch them. He sees his family wearing down as a result of his transformation and their new poverty. Even Grete seems to resent Gregor now, feeding him and cleaning up with a minimum of effort. The family replaces their maid with a cheap cleaning lady who tolerates Gregor’s appearance and speaks to him occasionally. They also take on three boarders, requiring them to move excess furniture into Gregor’s room, which distresses Gregor. Gregor has also lost his taste for the food Grete brings and he almost entirely ceases eating.
One evening, the cleaning lady leaves Gregor’s door open while the boarders lounge about the living room. Grete has been asked to play the violin for them, and Gregor creeps out of his bedroom to listen. The boarders, who initially seemed interested in Grete, grow bored with her performance, but Gregor is transfixed by it. One of the boarders spots Gregor and they become alarmed. Gregor’s father tries to shove the boarders back into their rooms, but the three men protest and announce that they will move out immediately without paying rent because of the disgusting conditions in the apartment.
Grete tells her parents that they must get rid of Gregor or they will all be ruined. Her father agrees, wishing Gregor could understand them and would leave of his own accord. Gregor does in fact understand and slowly moves back to the bedroom. There, determined to rid his family of his presence, Gregor dies.
Upon discovering that Gregor is dead, the family feels a great sense of relief. The father kicks out the boarders and decides to fire the cleaning lady, who has disposed of Gregor’s body. The family takes a trolley ride out to the countryside, during which they consider their finances. Months of spare living as a result of Gregor’s condition have left them with substantial savings. They decide to move to a better apartment. Grete appears to have her strength and beauty back, which leads her parents to think about finding her a husband."
Studied,"Educated is primarily retrospective, consisting of Tara Westover's memories about her past. She tells the story of the events of her life from a vantage point in her late twenties, occasionally interjecting to comment on the process of trying to arrive at an accurate version of the past. Tara was born the youngest of seven children to parents whom she refers to as Faye and Gene (pseudonyms). The Westover family lived on a farm in rural Idaho, where Gene made a living salvaging scrap metal while Faye worked as an unlicensed midwife and herbal healer. Gene suffered from paranoid fears about interference from the federal government, and as a result he refused to allow his children to attend school, receive birth certificates, or receive medical attention. Gene was also a devout Mormon who believed in radical self-sufficiency and an impending Day of Judgement.
		
Shifts in the Westover family dynamic began to emerge when Tara was about nine. Her mother's work as a midwife increased her sense of independence, but after sustaining a serious and untreated brain injury in a car accident, Faye began to lose confidence in her skills, and focused instead on using herbal remedies and a form of intuitive healing. Around this time, Tyler (the third son) announced that he was going to attend college, which estranged him from his family. Tyler's absence forced Tara to become more involved in helping her father with his scrapping work, which left her constantly exposed to the possibility of dangerous injury. It also made her more curious about possibly pursuing an education herself. When Tara was ten, she told her disapproving father that she wanted to begin going to school, but nothing came of the idea.
As Tara grew into her teens, she acquired more independence from her family due to taking on various jobs and pursuing singing and musical theatre in the local community. However, her life was dominated by the strict rules and religious doctrine her father imposed, and Tara often worried about becoming sinful. When Tara was thirteen, her older brother Shawn moved back home. At first Shawn and Tara were close and spent a lot of time together. When Tara was about fifteen, however, Shawn began to be physically abusive toward her. His behavior only got worse after Shawn experienced a head injury. Tyler eventually realized that Shawn was hurting Tara, and he urged Tara to seriously consider applying to college and getting away from the family. Although she was uncertain at first, Tara began to study and was eventually accepted at Brigham Young University, having passed herself off as homeschooled.
In January 2004, when Tara was seventeen years old, she moved to Utah to begin her college education. She found the adjustment very difficult at first, but eventually began to excel in her studies. Tara's finances were precarious, and she had to hold multiple jobs and maintain very high grades to retain her scholarship. Her emerging independence also caused a threatening dynamic between her, Gene, and Shawn. Whenever Tara returned to Buck's Peak, her father manipulated her into working for him, while Shawn continued to physically and emotionally abuse her. Tara eventually confided to a bishop about her life, and he helped her to secure funding to finance her education. Tara's studies, and the people she met, also gradually opened her eyes to different realities and force her to realize how damaging and isolating her childhood has been. Tara eventually changed her major to studying history, and is encouraged to apply for a study abroad program at Cambridge University in England.
Tara's experience at Cambridge broadened her horizons even further, and she was encouraged to consider graduate studies. Tara still felt isolated from her peers, and ashamed of her origins. She hid most of her past even from her friends and the men she occasionally dated. She was eventually awarded a prestigious Cambridge Gates Fellowship and moved to England to pursue a Master's degree. She remained in close contact with her family and returned to Idaho regularly to visit, but her relationship with them deteriorated. Shawn was growing increasingly erratic and violent, and Tara feared for the safety of his wife and young child. By chance, she revealed to her sister Audrey that Shawn had been abusive with her, and Audrey later confided that Shawn abused her as well. Audrey blamed herself for not protecting her younger sister, and suggested that she and Tara confront their parents and Shawn about what happened to them.
By then Tara had built a happy life for herself in England, and was working on a PhD in history at Cambridge. However, the attempt to speak the truth quickly became a source of conflict in the family. Tara became more and more ostracized within her family, eventually culminating in Shawn learning that she had been telling their parents about the abuse she suffered. Realizing her family would never trust her claims, Tara became estranged from most of them, with the exception of Tyler.  The estrangement from her family prompted grief and depression for Tara, but she was finally able to heal, and successfully completed her PhD. By the end of her memoir, Tara has accepted that she may never have a relationship with her family again, but she takes pride in the independence she has established, and the life she has built for herself."
Pool,"Two migrant workers, George and Lennie, have been let off a bus miles away from the California farm where they are due to start work. George is a small, dark man with “sharp, strong features.” Lennie, his companion, is his opposite, a giant of a man with a “shapeless” face. Overcome with thirst, the two stop in a clearing by a pool and decide to camp for the night. As the two converse, it becomes clear that Lennie has an intellectual disability, and is deeply devoted to George and dependent upon him for protection and guidance. George finds that Lennie, who loves petting soft things but often accidentally kills them, has been carrying and stroking a dead mouse. George angrily throws it away, fearing that Lennie might catch a disease from the dead animal. George complains loudly that his life would be easier without having to care for Lennie, but the reader senses that their friendship and devotion is mutual. He and Lennie share a dream of buying their own piece of land, farming it, and, much to Lennie’s delight, keeping rabbits. George ends the night by treating Lennie to the story he often tells him about what life will be like in such an idyllic place.
The next day, the men report to the nearby ranch. George, fearing how the boss will react to Lennie, insists that he’ll do all the talking. He lies, explaining that they travel together because they are cousins and that a horse kicked Lennie in the head when he was a child. They are hired. They meet Candy, an old “swamper,” or handyman, with a missing hand and an ancient dog, and Curley, the boss’s mean-spirited son. Curley is newly married, possessive of his flirtatious wife, and full of jealous suspicion. Once George and Lennie are alone in the bunkhouse, Curley’s wife appears and flirts with them. Lennie thinks she is “purty,” but George, sensing the trouble that could come from tangling with this woman and her husband, warns Lennie to stay away from her. Soon, the ranch-hands return from the fields for lunch, and George and Lennie meet Slim, the skilled mule driver who wields great authority on the ranch. Slim comments on the rarity of friendship like that between George and Lennie. Carlson, another ranch-hand, suggests that since Slim’s dog has just given birth, they should offer a puppy to Candy and shoot Candy’s old, good-for-nothing dog.
The next day, George confides in Slim that he and Lennie are not cousins, but have been friends since childhood. He tells how Lennie has often gotten them into trouble. For instance, they were forced to flee their last job because Lennie tried to touch a woman’s dress and was accused of rape. Slim agrees to give Lennie one of his puppies, and Carlson continues to badger Candy to kill his old dog. When Slim agrees with Carlson, saying that death would be a welcome relief to the suffering animal, Candy gives in. Carlson, before leading the dog outside, promises to do the job painlessly.
Slim goes to the barn to do some work, and Curley, who is maniacally searching for his wife, heads to the barn to accost Slim. Candy overhears George and Lennie discussing their plans to buy land, and offers his life’s savings if they will let him live there too. The three make a pact to let no one else know of their plan. Slim returns to the bunkhouse, berating Curley for his suspicions. Curley, searching for an easy target for his anger, finds Lennie and picks a fight with him. Lennie crushes Curley’s hand in the altercation. Slim warns Curley that if he tries to get George and Lennie fired, he will be the laughingstock of the farm.
The next night, most of the men go to the local brothel. Lennie is left with Crooks, the lonely, Black stable-hand, and Candy. Curley’s wife flirts with them, refusing to leave until the other men come home. She notices the cuts on Lennie’s face and suspects that he, and not a piece of machinery as Curley claimed, is responsible for hurting her husband. This thought amuses her. The next day, Lennie accidentally kills his puppy in the barn. Curley’s wife enters and consoles him. She admits that life with Curley is a disappointment, and wishes that she had followed her dream of becoming a movie star. Lennie tells her that he loves petting soft things, and she offers to let him feel her hair. When he grabs too tightly, she cries out. In his attempt to silence her, he accidentally breaks her neck.
Lennie flees back to a pool of the Salinas River that George had designated as a meeting place should either of them get into trouble. As the men back at the ranch discover what has happened and gather together a lynch party, George joins Lennie. Much to Lennie’s surprise, George is not mad at him for doing “a bad thing.” George begins to tell Lennie the story of the farm they will have together. As he describes the rabbits that Lennie will tend, the sound of the approaching lynch party grows louder. George shoots his friend in the back of the head.
When the other men arrive, George lets them believe that Lennie had the gun, and George wrestled it away from him and shot him. Only Slim understands what has really happened, that George has killed his friend out of mercy. Slim consolingly leads him away, and the other men, completely puzzled, watch them leave."
Whence,"In a pair of sumptuous drawingrooms, one in a Parisian mansion, the other in a chateau on a luxurious estate in the countryside surrounding Paris, two aristocrats are very bored. The Marquise de Merteuil decides, therefore, to construct a little intrigue for her own amusement and the amusement of her former lover, the Vicomte de Valmont. The Marquise is aware that a young girl of good family, Cécile Volanges, has only just left the convent so that she can be married to the Comte de Gercourt. Now, the Marquise has a bone to pick with this particular Comte, and so she suggests to the Vicomte that he seduce and debauch Cécile to create a scandal and humiliate Gercourt. Valmont accepts the Marquise's proposal somewhat coolly, since he already has his eyes on another prey, the highly religious Présidente de Tourvel, the chaste wife of a member of Parliament. But, never one to refuse a challenge, Valmont suggests that he and the Marquise enter into a slightly different bet: if he can obtain written proof that he has slept with the Présidente, the Marquise must yield herself to him.
Meanwhile, Cécile has been presented to society, and in society she meets the charming and gentle Chevalier Danceny. Danceny becomes Cécile's music teacher and slowly, with a little coaxing from the Marquise de Merteuil, the two young people fall in love. During this time, Valmont is out in the country on his aunt's estate, trying to turn the Présidente de Tourvel's head. He has very little luck in this department despite his use of every known trick in the book. Then, as coincidence would have, Cécile's mother, Madame Volanges, who corresponds regularly with the Présidente de Tourvel, happens to say some rather unflattering things about Valmont in a letter which Valmont just happens to steal and read. And thus it is that Valmont resolves to seduce the little Volanges as revenge for her mother's only too accurate trash-talk.
Cécile's ""seduction"" would be more accurately termed ""rape,"" but the girl is persuaded to enter into a bizarre student-teacher relationship with Valmont, so that for a while she is being courted by Danceny and ""loved"" nightly by Valmont. During his time as Cécile's teacher, Valmont is also able to win the heart of the Présidente de Tourvel.
However, the Marquise de Merteuil is not so easily pleased. Rather than encourage the Vicomte de Valmont to meet the conditions of their original agreement, she mocks him for having fallen in love with the Présidente de Tourvel. Valmont's pride does not withstand these attacks very well, and to avoid compromising his reputation as a good-for-nothing gigolo, he leaves the Présidente cold, with no explanation. Cécile fares no better, after a particularly rough night in Valmont's room, she miscarries his child.
Now things are really looking bad for everyone involved. The Présidente de Tourvel removes herself to a convent where she proceeds to die of grief and shame. Merteuil and Valmont are never able to reconcile their little snit and can only agree to go to war with one another. Danceny learns that Valmont seduced Cécile and challenges him to a duel; and Danceny wins the duel. Valmont hands over his correspondence with the Marquise to Danceny on his deathbed; all of society learns of her schemes and machinations. The Marquise is forced to flee town and, like a wicked old witch, is never heard from again. Full of regret for her activities with Valmont, Cécile returns to the convent from whence she came, with the intention of becoming a nun."
Billion,"In Part I of The Elegant Universe, “The Edge of Knowledge,” Greene introduces the central problem of modern physics: the incompatibility of Einstein’s theory of general relativity with quantum mechanics. He then lists the physical curiosities—properties of the motion of light, gravity, and the behavior of particles at the subatomic level—that have prevented physicists from establishing a single coherent theory for how the universe works. For most of the twentieth century, physicists contented themselves with describing either the most small-scale or the most large-scale workings of the cosmos, but never both simultaneously. At the end of this section, Greene describes both the objectives and the promise of superstring theory, which attempts to merge the laws of general relativity with those of quantum mechanics.
Without dismissing the importance of electrons and quarks, which are the basis of quantum mechanics, superstring theory depicts the smallest particles in the universe not as dots but as tiny strings of energy. These strings are one hundred billion billion (a quintillion) times smaller than a single atomic nucleus. They vibrate in different patterns, which in turn produce different particle properties. But because these strings are too tiny to locate with current scientific tools, superstring theory is not yet predictable or testable. Therefore, physicists like Greene must work with approximations of equations until more information has been verified. Still, the promise of string theory is tremendous. Only string theory’s conceptual framework offers any possibility of unifying general relativity and quantum mechanics into one complete understanding of how the universe works.
In Part II, “The Dilemma of Space, Time, and the Quanta,” Greene reviews the basic precepts of the two competing theories—first, Einstein’s special and general relativity, and then the “microscopic weirdness” of quantum mechanics. General relativity presupposes a smooth surface of space, but at an ultramicroscopic level (which quantum mechanics has helped unveil), the spatial fabric is subject to violent undulations known as “quantum foam.” Greene also discusses the basic principle of quantum mechanics: the uncertainty principle. The uncertainty principle predicts the impossibility of knowing both the exact location and the velocity of a particle at any given time. Greene goes over the four fundamental forces—the strong force, the weak force, electromagnetism, and gravity—and he describes the complexity of incorporating gravity into the standard model of the first three. In the last chapter of this section, Greene stresses the necessity of finding a new theory that revises both general relativity and quantum mechanics. Like many of his colleagues, Greene simply cannot accept that the universe is, at its core, divided into two contradictory theoretical frameworks.
In Part III, “The Cosmic Symphony,” Greene discusses in detail how superstring theory works. He employs many musical metaphors to suggest how strings “harmonize” or bring together the most puzzling aspects of the cosmos. After praising the elegance and economy of the theory, Greene gives a brief history of its first incarnation in the 1970s, when it was referred to as the bosonic string theory. He also explains the subsequent revisions the theory underwent during the first superstring revolution in 1984. Greene then describes how supersymmetry— a concept that predicts the existence of superpartners that correspond with all known particles—transformed string theory into superstring theory.
With these basics covered, Greene proceeds to one of the oddest claims of string theory: the theory that the universe contains far more dimensions than we can perceive. In its current form, superstring theory postulates the existence of eleven total dimensions: ten of space and one of time. According to the theory, equations of quantum theory can mesh beautifully with relativity if we assume the existence of eleven dimensions. Greene concludes “The Cosmic Symphony” by analyzing the central difficulty of string theory—namely, the lack of experimental evidence for superstring theory. He describes the efforts he and his colleagues have made to develop string theory and refine its underlying mathematical principles. He shows what a Calabi-Yau space (the six-dimensional shape that physicists believe the additional, curled-up dimensions of space will form) may look like.
Part IV, “String Theory and the Fabric of Spacetime,” is the most complicated and involved section of the book. Greene begins with an overview of quantum geometry and the new kind of math that must emerge to explain the universe on an ultramicroscopic scale. He argues that contrary to what physicists previously believed, the fabric of space can be ripped and torn with no catastrophic consequences. He also covers the second superstring revolution, which shows that all five string theories are really part of a single, unified framework called M-theory. It is fitting that no one knows what the “M” signifies, because M-theory is one of the most radical, incompletely understood theories ever to evolve. M-theory proposes the unification of gravity with the three nongravitational forces. It is an extension of string theory that suggests the elementary particles of the universe might include, in addition to strings, two-dimensional membranes and three-dimensional blobs of varying size. Greene ends his discussion of the latest advances in superstring theory by discussing its cosmological implications, what it might reveal about the origins of the universe.
Part V, “Unification in the Twenty-First Century,” concludes the book. It covers the prospects of string theory in the twenty-first century. It describes the advances Greene and other string theorists hope to make in unveiling a single theory to explain the entire universe. For all his optimistic predictions, however, Greene never hesitates to admit that because of its complexity, superstring theory might not be fully understood for many years."
Courts,"As a huntress and her family’s primary source of survival, nineteen-year-old Feyre stalks the bleak woods, a little farther from home than usual. Her family was once very wealthy, but they now live in poverty. Feyre’s luck turns when she spots a deer. At the same time, an enormous wolf appears out of nowhere. Feyre wonders if the wolf is a faerie in disguise. She hates faeries for all the harm they have done to humans. Feyre decides to use a precious ash arrow, a surefire method to kill a faerie, just in case. She fires the arrow as the wolf attacks the deer, killing the beast. The next evening, a golden beast bursts through the door of her family’s rundown cottage. The beast reveals that the wolf was indeed a faerie named Andras. The beast demands payment for his death under the terms of the Treaty between the human and faerie realms. The beast gives Feyre a choice: he can kill her now, or she can follow him to the faerie realm of Prythian to live out the rest of her days. Feyre chooses to live. 
In Prythian, Feyre learns the golden beast is a High Fae called Tamlin. He is the High Lord of the Spring Court. Tamlin and all the faeries in his court wear permanent masks on their faces due to an affliction called the blight. At first, Feyre is determined to escape Prythian, but she soon becomes accustomed to her new home. She learns about its history and magic and that much of what she was raised to believe about faeries, including their inability to lie and their aversion to iron, are myths. Feyre develops an affection for Alis, her lady-in-waiting, and Lucien, Tamlin’s best friend. Tamlin encourages her to explore her love for painting and to improve her reading skills. He reveals that he has ensured her family is well cared for in the human realm. Romantic and sexual tension grows between them. Although Feyre finds Prythian beautiful, it is full of dangerous creatures and intrigue. The blight makes life in Prythian increasingly perilous. After a threatening visit from a High Fae named Rhysand, Tamlin believes Feyre is no longer safe in Prythian and decides to send her back to the human realm. The night before she leaves, they make love. Tamlin tells Feyre that he loves her. Though she loves him too, she cannot bring herself to speak the words aloud.  
Feyre returns to the human realm to find that Tamlin was true to his word. Her family is extremely wealthy and well cared for. Her father and sisters have been glamoured, or tricked with faerie magic, and know nothing about faeries or how their wealth was restored. They believe Feyre has been away caring for a sick aunt. Soon, her sister Nesta reveals the glamour did not work on her. After Feyre was taken to Prythian, Nesta searched for her but was unable to cross the wall between the human and faerie realms. Nesta also reveals she is still angry at their father for not trying harder to save their mother’s life. Nesta’s words inspire Feyre to fight harder for Tamlin and she sets off for Prythian to fight the blight alongside him.  
When Feyre arrives at the Spring Court, Tamlin’s manor house is in shambles. Alis is the only one left. Alis reveals that the blight is a euphemism that refers to Amarantha, the High Queen of Prythian. Amarantha is an interloper who took Prythian over by force. She stole the powers of the High Fae and placed a curse on Tamlin that could only be broken by a woman who hated the fae declaring her love for him. Since Feyre never told Tamlin she loved him, the curse remained. The curse prevented the faeries from telling Feyre the truth, so they used the blight to explain their masks and other conflicts. Alis can tell Feyre this because Amarantha has relaxed part of the curse, believing she’s already won, but there is still one aspect of the curse Alis cannot reveal. When Alis explains that Tamlin and Lucien are Amarantha’s captives, Feyre decides to go after them. 
Feyre journeys to Amarantha’s faerie court Under the Mountain, where she becomes a captive as well. Amarantha gives her the chance to save Tamlin by completing three tasks or by solving a riddle. For the first task, Feyre uses her hunting skills to escape a giant worm in a labyrinth. As the faeries place bets and watch in amusement, the only one to bet on Feyre is Rhysand. After, he heals her broken arm. In exchange, Feyre agrees to spend a week every month with him in the Night Court. For the second task, Feyre must successfully solve a puzzle and choose the right lever or she and Lucien will be impaled and crushed. She makes the correct choice with the aid of Rhysand’s voice in her head. In the meantime, Rhysand parades Feyre around as his escort at parties. 
For the third task, Feyre must stab three faeries in the heart with ash wood daggers. Despite her guilt, she knows it’s the only way to break the curse. She stabs the first two faeries, but when the hood is removed from the third one, it is Tamlin. At first, Feyre believes she must kill the man she loves until she remembers two conversations about Tamlin’s heart of stone. She believes this means Tamlin’s heart is literally made of stone so he cannot be harmed by the dagger. Knowing Amarantha wants Tamlin for herself and doesn’t want to see him killed, Feyre plunges the dagger into Tamlin’s chest. She is correct, but Amarantha refuses to break the curse based on a technicality. In a rage, Amarantha beats Feyre almost to death. Feyre finally realizes the answer to Amarantha’s riddle is the word love. She speaks the solution aloud and the curse breaks just as Feyre dies. With the curse broken, Tamlin and Rhysand join forces to destroy Amarantha. One by one, the six High Lords gift Feyre with healing light and immortality. Tamlin sets a bit of this golden light on her heart, resurrecting Feyre and transforming her into one of the High Fae. Feyre and Tamlin are finally free, but Feyre must reckon with her new life and the lives she took to bring them to this point."
Stopping,"Three damned souls, Garcin, Inez, and Estelle are brought to the same room in hell by a mysterious Valet. They had all expected medieval torture devices to punish them for eternity, but instead find a plain room furnished in Second Empire style. None of them will admit the reason for their damnation: Garcin says that he was executed for being a pacifist, while Estelle insists that a mistake has been made.
Inez however, demands that they all stop lying to themselves and confess to their crimes. She refuses to believe that they all ended up in the room by accident and soon realizes that they have been placed together to make each other miserable. Garcin suggests that they try to leave each other alone, but Inez starts to sing about an execution and Estelle wants to find a mirror. Inez tries to seduce Estelle by offering to be her ""mirror"" and tell her everything she sees, but ends up frightening her instead.
After arguing they decide to confess to their crimes so they know what to expect from each other. Garcin cheated and mistreated his wife; Inez seduced her cousin's wife while living with them; and Estelle cheated on her husband and drowned her illegitimate baby. Despite their revelations they continue to get on each other's nerves. Garcin finally gives in to Estelle's attempts to seduce him, driving Inez crazy. He begs Estelle to tell him he is not a coward for attempting to flee his country during wartime. When Inez tells him that Estelle is just agreeing with him so she can be with a man, Garcin tries to escape. The door suddenly opens, but he is unable to leave. He says that he will not be saved until Inez has faith in him. She refuses, promising to make him miserable forever. Forgetting that they are all dead, Estelle unsuccessfully tries to kill Inez, stabbing her repeatedly. Shocked at the absurdity of his fate, Garcin concludes, ""hell is other people."""
Prostrate,"Our Town is introduced and narrated by the Stage Manager, who welcomes the audience to the fictional town of Grover’s Corners, New Hampshire, early on a May morning in 1901. In the opening scene, the stage is largely empty, except for some tables and chairs that represent the homes of the Gibbs and Webb families, the setting of most of the action in Act I. The set remains sparse throughout the rest of the play.
	After the Stage Manager’s introduction, the activities of a typical day begin. Howie Newsome, the milkman, and Joe Crowell, Jr., the paperboy, make their delivery rounds. Dr. Gibbs returns from delivering a set of twins at one of the homes in town. Mrs. Gibbs and Mrs. Webb make breakfast, send their children off to school, and meet in their gardens to gossip. The two women also discuss their modest ambitions, and Mrs. Gibbs reveals that she longs to visit Paris.
Throughout the play, the characters pantomime their activities and chores. When Howie makes his milk deliveries, for example, no horse appears onstage despite the fact that he frequently addresses his horse as “Bessie.” Howie does not actually hold anything in his hands, but he pantomimes carrying bottles of milk, and the sound of clinking milk bottles comes from offstage. This deliberate abandonment of props goes hand in hand with the minimal set.
	The Stage Manager interrupts the action. He calls Professor Willard and then Mr. Webb out onto the stage to tell the audience some basic facts about Grover’s Corners. Mr. Webb not only reports to the audience, but also takes questions from some “audience members” who are actually characters in the play seated in the audience.
Afternoon arrives, school lets out, and George Gibbs meets his neighbor Emily Webb outside the gate of her house. We see the first inkling of George and Emily’s romantic affection for one another during this scene and during Emily’s subsequent conversation with her mother. The Stage Manager thanks and dismisses Emily and Mrs. Webb, then launches into a discussion of a time capsule that will be placed in the foundation of a new bank building in town. He tells us that he wishes to put a copy of Our Town into this time capsule.
	Now evening, a choir in the orchestra pit begins to sing “Blessed Be the Tie That Binds.” The choir, directed by the bitter yet comical choirmaster Simon Stimson, continues to sing as George and Emily talk to each other through their open windows. Mrs. Webb, Mrs. Gibbs, and their gossipy friend Mrs. Soames return home from choir practice and chat about the choirmaster’s alcoholism. The women return to their respective homes. George and his sister Rebecca sit at a window and look outside. Rebecca ponders the position of Grover’s Corners within the vastness of the universe, which she believes is contained within “the Mind of God.” Night has fallen on Grover’s Corners, and the first act comes to an end.
	Act II takes place three years later, on George and Emily’s wedding day. George tries to visit his fiancée, but he is shooed away by Mr. and Mrs. Webb, who insist that it is bad luck for the groom to see the bride-to-be on the wedding day anytime before the ceremony. Mrs. Webb goes upstairs to make sure Emily does not come downstairs. George is left alone with Mr. Webb. The young man and his future father-in-law awkwardly discuss marriage and how to be a virtuous husband.
	The Stage Manager interjects and introduces a flashback to the previous year. George and Emily are on their way home from school. George has just been elected class president and Emily has just been elected secretary and treasurer. George has also become something of a local baseball star. Emily tells George that his popularity has made him “conceited and stuck-up.” George, though hurt, thanks Emily for her honesty, but Emily becomes mortified by her own words and asks George to forget them. The two stop at Mr. Morgan’s drugstore for ice-cream sodas and, over the course of their drink, admit their mutual affection. George decides to scrap his plan of attending agriculture school in favor of staying in Grover’s Corners with Emily.
	We return to the day of the wedding in 1904. Both the bride and groom feel jittery, but their parents calm them down and the ceremony goes ahead as planned. The Stage Manager acts as the clergyman. The newlyweds run out through the audience, and the second act ends with the Stage Manager’s announcement that it is time for another intermission.
	Act III takes place nine years later, in a cemetery on a hilltop overlooking the town. Emily has died in childbirth and is about to be buried. The funeral party occupies the back of the stage. The most prominent characters in this act, the dead souls who already inhabit the cemetery, sit in chairs at the front of the stage. Among the dead are Mrs. Gibbs, Mrs. Soames, Wally Webb, and Simon Stimson. As the funeral takes place, the dead speak, serving as detached witnesses. Death has rendered them largely indifferent to earthly events. Emily joins the dead, but she misses her previous life and decides to go back and relive part of it. The other souls disapprove and advise Emily to stay in the cemetery.
	With the aid of the Stage Manager, Emily steps into the past, revisiting the morning of her twelfth birthday. Howie Newsome and Joe Crowell, Jr. make their deliveries as usual. Mrs. Webb gives her daughter some presents and calls to Mr. Webb. As Emily participates, she also watches the scene as an observer, noting her parents’ youth and beauty. Emily now has a nostalgic appreciation for everyday life that her parents and the other living characters do not share. She becomes agonized by the beauty and transience of everyday life and demands to be taken back to the cemetery. As Emily settles in among the dead souls, George lays prostrate by her tomb. “They don’t understand,” she says of the living. The stars come out over Grover’s Corners, and the play ends."
Devolve,"The novel begins in prison, with the novel’s protagonist and narrator Oliver Marks handcuffed to a table and talking to Joseph Colborne, the detective who was formerly assigned to his case. Colborne congratulates Oliver on being granted parole after serving a ten-year sentence for the murder of his classmate, Richard Stirling, and asks him to share what actually happened ten years earlier. Oliver agrees and the narrative shifts in time to a period ten years earlier. At the start of each chapter, called “acts” as in a play, the novel returns to the present, where Filippa drives Oliver to Dellecher Classical Conservatory, the prestigious arts school they attended together. Detective Colborne and Oliver walk around the lake, reliving and narrating the events that led to Oliver’s incarceration.
The novel’s main action revolves around  seven fourth-year acting students. Their final year will focus on Shakespeare’s tragedies, and their fall performance is slated to be Julius Caesar. Close friends, they can easily anticipate their roles based on previous castings, even before their auditions: Richard will be Caesar; James will play Brutus; Alexander, Cassius; Oliver will be Octavius; Meredith’s role will be Calpurnia; Wren will play Portia; and Filippa will be in drag, playing multiple male characters. The students are also assigned roles for a Halloween performance of Macbeth. 
In response to pressures of their fourth year, previously close relations between the students quickly devolve. Richard begins abusing his classmates, physically and verbally, during rehearsals for Julius Caesar. His girlfriend, Meredith, and his main competitor, James, are both covered in bruises. Tensions run high as the play is slow to come together and, after the Macbeth performance, a friendly game in the lake turns ugly when Richard holds James under water, nearly drowning him. Meredith breaks up with Richard, and the group decides to teach him a lesson, using a rehearsal to attack their classmate. But despite obstacles, the play finally comes together, and opening night is a success. At the raucous afterparty, Meredith flirts with a cellist and Richard, enraged, attacks him, sending him to the infirmary. Angry, Meredith invites Oliver up to her room, and the two have sex, while an enraged Richard pounds on the door.  
A few hours later, Filippa summons Meredith and Oliver to the lake. There Oliver and Meredith discover a battered, broken and seemingly deceased Richard floating in the water. Richard emits a gurgling sound indicating he’s still alive. Frightened and exhausted of Richard’s abuse, the six collectively decide to let him die in the water, assuming that he injured himself while intoxicated. They craft a narrative of likely events for school administration and the police and feel relief when everyone seems to accept their version of events. But guilt erodes their relations with each other and impacts their behavior. Meredith and Oliver continue dating but struggle to be comfortable together under the watchful eye of Richard’s specter. Alexander indulges even more freely in drugs and alcohol. Wren withdraws into herself while James’s behavior becomes erratic. The only character who seems able to hold things together is Filippa. The Thanksgiving holiday offers little respite from their stress. When Oliver’s holiday plans to visit Meredith in New York are derailed by an unexpected visit from James, Meredith is upset that Oliver chooses James over her, a frequent point of contention. 
The Christmas holidays prove equally tense. Oliver learns that his family cannot afford for him to return to Dellecher and, after fighting with them, flees to New York, spending the break in Meredith’s family apartment. Oliver arranges for financial aid to complete his final year, agreeing to be the custodian for the Dellecher Castle, where the acting students live. The play for the spring is King Lear and, unlike the fall, the casting comes as a surprise. James is assigned the role of Edmund, the play’s main antagonist, while Oliver, usually cast as James’s sidekick, is given the part of Edgar. The two friends are now opponents. Not only do the teachers, Frederick and Camilo, take roles to fill out the mature cast, but James and Meredith also have romantic scenes, a challenge given their mutual dislike. The students will also perform Romeo and Juliet as a masque. 
When the police return and Alexander overdoses, Oliver realizes the group is beginning to crack under the strain of allowing Richard to die. While cleaning the fireplace, Oliver finds a bloody piece of cloth, clearly from Richard’s shirt, and realizes that his death was not the accident they believed it to be. Oliver hides the fabric but feels mounting anxiety. At the same time, rehearsals for King Lear add drama to the students’ lives. Prompted by Gwendolyn, who deplores their lack of connection, James and Meredith kiss passionately. Watching, Oliver realizes he is jealous and comes to understand that he has feelings for James. During another rehearsal, this time for a fight scene, James attacks Oliver, breaking his nose. They limp through the Romeo and Juliet performance, their relationships fragile and tense, although King Lear proves their final undoing. 
The day of the performance, while cleaning, Oliver finds a bloody boat hook hidden in James’s mattress and realizes that he must have used it to hit Richard. Oliver confronts James, who admits that he did hit Richard with it after Richard bullied him and accused him of being in love with Oliver. James also explains that Filippa has known the truth all along and helped him hide the crime. Despite these revelations, Oliver and James manage somehow to finish the play. The detectives and school administration wait in the wings. After the play, Oliver confesses to the crime James committed. Though Detective Colborne is suspicious of his confession, Oliver doesn’t recant it, and after a brief trial, Oliver is charged with second-degree murder. Oliver’s story finished, the novel ends in the present. Colborne wishes him well, and Filippa, who has visited Oliver every two weeks during his time in prison, informs him that James committed suicide years ago. Oliver goes to New York to see Meredith, now a famous actress, and the two resume a relationship. Filippa sends Oliver a note James had left for him, which is a passage from Pericles, Prince of Tyre. The passage is obscure but leaves open the possibility that James, whose body was never found, may still be alive."
Cures,"The interrelated short stories in Love Medicine span half a century, with various narrators taking turns telling the stories. In 1934, Marie Lazarre, age fourteen, leaves home to live at Sacred Heart Convent, a school on a hill in town. A perverted nun, Sister Leopolda, considers Marie evil and tortures her, culminating in scalding her with boiling water and stabbing her hand with a fork. As Marie flees, she runs into a boy named Nector Kashpaw who thinks Marie has stolen from the convent. Nector, good with money, thinks he might get a reward if he catches Marie. They argue, tussle, and have sex. Marie and Nector go on to have a long marriage, many children, and many challenges. These events happen in “Saint Marie” and “Wild Geese.”
In “The Beads,” it is 1948 and nine-year-old June Morrissey comes to live with Marie and Nector Kashpaw after her mother dies in the woods. Filthy and malnourished, June thrives under Marie’s care. A child of the woods, June grows close to her Uncle Eli, a recluse, and goes to live with him.
Three stories—“Lulu’s Boys,” “The Plunge of the Brave,” and “Flesh and Blood”—are narrated in 1957, but each offers events and details from both the past and present. Lulu Lamartine’s husband, Henry, dies when a train hits his car, and Lulu has sex with Henry’s brother, Bev, resulting in the birth of their son, Henry Junior. Several years later, Bev visits Lulu to claim Henry Junior as his own, but he falls in love with Lulu despite his marriage to Elsa. 
In “The Plunge of the Brave,” Nector Kashpaw narrates his story, beginning in the 1930s. As a young man, he played in Hollywood Western films and modeled for a famous painting called The Plunge of the Brave. After marrying Marie, seventeen years go by, filled with babies, drinking, gambling, work, and tribal leadership. In 1952, Nector realizes that he still pines for Lulu, whom he loved as a teenager. He reconnects with her and they make love, leading to weekly trysts for five years. When Nector decides to leave Marie, he pens two letters. The letter to Lulu accidentally leads to burning Lulu’s house down when Nector lets a lit cigarette ignite it. On the same day, in “Flesh and Blood,” Marie discovers the letter saying that Nector is leaving her for Lulu. Marie finds the letter in her kitchen after she visits the dying Sister Leopolda. However, when Nector later returns home, Marie realizes that he is staying and hides the letter again without mentioning that she found it in the first place.
Lyman Lamartine narrates “The Red Convertible” in 1973, but the story begins in 1970 when Lyman and Henry Junior buy a red convertible and go on a road trip to Alaska. When they return, Henry Junior is drafted and ends up in a Vietnamese prison, returning with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Before he goes home, Henry Junior meets young Albertine Johnson in Fargo. They have sex, but Henry Junior gets drunk and loses his senses. He explodes, screams, and weeps as “The Bridge” ends. Back at home, Henry Junior is jumpy and mean. Lyman deliberately damages the convertible to give Henry Junior a reason to live as he hoped Henry Junior would be interested in repairing the car. However, when the brothers drive to the Red River, they drink too much, Henry Junior turns morose, and they fight. After Henry Junior jumps into the river and drowns, Lyman pushes the car into the water and watches it sink.
The next cluster of stories are narrated from 1980 to 1984. Albertine Johnson and Dot Nanapush work at a truck weighing station together in “Scales.” Gerry, Dot’s husband, escapes from prison but is arrested again. Dot gives birth to their daughter, and Gerry is sent to a maximum-security prison for shooting a state trooper. June Morrissey dies on Easter Sunday while walking in the snow after a sexual encounter. Her niece, Albertine, goes home a week after her funeral and witnesses a violent night of drinking and fighting that involves King, Lynette, Marie, Nector, Lipsha, Gordie, and baby King Junior. Gordie, who has been separated from June for some time, starts drinking heavily, feeling guilty and responsible for her death. He hallucinates visits from June, lost in a fog of alcohol-induced psychosis. When Gordie hits a deer in “Crown of Thorns,” he thinks he has hit June. He goes to the convent to confess “killing his wife” and meets Sister Mary Martin who sees the deer in the backseat of the car, not a woman. 
The final cluster of events focuses on Lipsha Morrissey who was adopted by Marie and Nector as a young child. Lipsha carries magic in him and has a healing touch. He serves as an attendant in the Senior Citizens home, now the residence of Marie, Nector, and Lulu. Lipsha walks in on Lulu and Nector having sex in the laundry room, indicating that Nector still lusts for her. Lipsha agrees to help Marie reclaim Nector’s heart with “love medicine.” When he misses shooting wild geese to use their hearts for the medicine, he buys frozen turkeys as a shortcut. However, Nector chokes and dies when he eats the turkey heart. Family and friends attend Grandpa Nector’s funeral, and Nector’s spirit visits Marie. Lipsha explains to Marie that Nector loved her and releases the man’s spirit. Despite Lulu’s affair with Nector, Marie and Lulu become friends when Marie agrees to help Lulu recover from eye surgery. 
In the final story, Lulu tells Lipsha who his biological parents are: his mother was June Morrissey and his father was Gerry Nanapush. Lipsha journeys to a border town where he joins the army and envisions that Gerry will escape prison yet again. He leaves the army and drives to see King, whom he now knows is his half-brother, and finds him with Lynette and King Junior. As the men play poker, the TV announces Gerry’s escape. Gerry soon appears because King snitched on him while they were in prison and he’s angry about it. When the police show up to arrest Gerry, he escapes. After Lipsha demands King’s car, which Lipsha won in a game of poker, he discovers his father, Gerry, in the trunk. Lipsha helps Gerry cross the border and escape the police. After, Lipsha accepts who he is and emotionally releases his parents while standing on a bridge over a river, ready to return to the reservation."
Reputation,"Guy Montag is a fireman who burns books in a futuristic American city. In Montag’s world, firemen start fires rather than putting them out. The people in this society do not read books, enjoy nature, spend time by themselves, think independently, or have meaningful conversations. Instead, they drive very fast, watch excessive amounts of television on wall-size sets, and listen to the radio on “Seashell Radio” sets attached to their ears.
Montag encounters a gentle seventeen-year-old girl named Clarisse McClellan, who opens his eyes to the emptiness of his life with her innocently penetrating questions and her unusual love of people and nature. Over the next few days, Montag experiences a series of disturbing events. First, his wife, Mildred, attempts suicide by swallowing a bottle of sleeping pills. Then, when he responds to an alarm that an old woman has a stash of hidden literature, the woman shocks him by choosing to be burned alive along with her books. A few days later, he hears that Clarisse has been killed by a speeding car. Montag’s dissatisfaction with his life increases, and he begins to search for a solution in a stash of books that he has stolen from his own fires and hidden inside an air-conditioning vent.
When Montag fails to show up for work, his fire chief, Beatty, pays a visit to his house. Beatty explains that it’s normal for a fireman to go through a phase of wondering what books have to offer, and he delivers a dizzying monologue explaining how books came to be banned in the first place. According to Beatty, special-interest groups and other “minorities” objected to books that offended them. Soon, books all began to look the same, as writers tried to avoid offending anybody. This was not enough, however, and society as a whole decided to simply burn books rather than permit conflicting opinions. Beatty tells Montag to take twenty-four hours or so to see if his stolen books contain anything worthwhile and then turn them in for incineration. Montag begins a long and frenzied night of reading.
Overwhelmed by the task of reading, Montag looks to his wife for help and support, but she prefers television to her husband’s company and cannot understand why he would want to take the terrible risk of reading books. He remembers that he once met a retired English professor named Faber sitting in a park, and he decides that this man might be able to help him understand what he reads. He visits Faber, who tells him that the value of books lies in the detailed awareness of life that they contain. Faber says that Montag needs not only books but also the leisure to read them and the freedom to act upon their ideas.
Faber agrees to help Montag with his reading, and they concoct a risky scheme to overthrow the status quo. Faber will contact a printer and begin reproducing books, and Montag will plant books in the homes of firemen to discredit the profession and to destroy the machinery of censorship. Faber gives him a two-way radio earpiece (the “green bullet”) so that he can hear what Montag hears and talk to him secretly.
Montag goes home, and soon two of his wife’s friends arrive to watch television. The women discuss their families and the war that is about to be declared in an extremely frivolous manner. Their superficiality angers him, and he takes out a book of poetry and reads “Dover Beach” by Matthew Arnold. Faber buzzes in his ear for him to be quiet, and Mildred tries to explain that the poetry reading is a standard way for firemen to demonstrate the uselessness of literature. The women are extremely disturbed by the poem and leave to file a complaint against Montag.
Montag goes to the fire station and hands over one of his books to Beatty. Beatty confuses Montag by barraging him with contradictory quotations from great books. Beatty exploits these contradictions to show that literature is morbid and dangerously complex, and that it deserves incineration. Suddenly, the alarm sounds, and they rush off to answer the call, only to find that the alarm is at Montag’s own house. Mildred gets into a cab with her suitcase, and Montag realizes that his own wife has betrayed him.
Beatty forces Montag to burn the house himself; when he is done, Beatty places him under arrest. When Beatty continues to berate Montag, Montag turns the flamethrower on his superior and proceeds to burn him to ashes. Montag knocks the other firemen unconscious and runs. The Mechanical Hound, a monstrous machine that Beatty has set to attack Montag, pounces and injects Montag’s leg with a large dose of anesthetic. Montag manages to destroy it with his flamethrower; then he walks off the numbness in his leg and escapes with some books that were hidden in his backyard. He hides these in another fireman’s house and calls in an alarm from a pay phone.
Montag goes to Faber’s house, where he learns that a new Hound has been put on his trail, along with several helicopters and a television crew. Faber tells Montag that he is leaving for St. Louis to see a retired printer who may be able to help them. Montag gives Faber some money and tells him how to remove Montag’s scent from his house so the Hound will not enter it. Montag then takes some of Faber’s old clothes and runs off toward the river. The whole city watches as the chase unfolds on TV, but Montag manages to escape in the river and change into Faber’s clothes to disguise his scent. He drifts downstream into the country and follows a set of abandoned railroad tracks until he finds a group of renegade intellectuals (“the Book People”), led by a man named Granger, who welcome him. They are a part of a nationwide network of book lovers who have memorized many great works of literature and philosophy. They hope that they may be of some help to mankind in the aftermath of the war that has just been declared. Montag’s role is to memorize the Book of Ecclesiastes. Enemy jets appear in the sky and completely obliterate the city with bombs. Montag and his new friends move on to search for survivors and rebuild civilization."
Tested,"The story starts with Alina Starkov and Malyev “Mal” Oretsev, two young orphans living in a Duke’s house in Karemzin. They are being tested by Grisha Examiners who aim to find out if they’re capable of using the Small Science, a system of magic-like abilities. The two orphans hold onto each other tightly, hoping not to be split up by the judgment of the Examiners.  
Years later, Alina and Mal are adults in the same regiment of the First Army of Ravka. The regiment has been tasked with crossing the Shadow Fold, an expanse of blackness that divides the country of Ravka in half. The Fold plays host to the volcra, monsters who feed on people and fear the light. During the crossing their sandskiff is attacked by volcra, resulting in numerous casualties. But when they attack Mal, magic is awakened inside Alina and light emanates from her. She scares the monsters away.  
When the skiff returns to the drydock, Alina is brought before the Darkling, a powerful Grisha who leads the Second Army. The Darkling tests her for power and finds that she is capable of manipulating light. Knowing that he has finally found the Sun Summoner, the only Grisha with the capability to affect the Fold, the Darkling sends Alina to the capital with a retinue of guards for protection. The Darkling tells her she may be able to destroy the Fold for good. Her carriage is attacked by Fjerdan assassins, and Alina only survives because the Darkling arrives just in time to save her.  
Upon her arrival at the Little Palace in Os Alta, the capital, Alina meets the King and Queen of Ravka and her presence brings hope to the war-torn country for the first time in many years. She befriends Genya, a Grisha woman who teaches Alina the ins-and-outs of Grisha life. Alina begins her training by researching Grisha history and theory, learning martial arts from a former mercenary named Botkin, and attempting to use her power with the help of an ancient Grisha woman named Baghra. At first, Alina is only able to use her power with the help of either the Darkling or Baghra, who act as amplifiers for other Grisha.   
Alina sends letters to Mal but receives no response for months. The lack of correspondence makes her feel alienated from Mal and she begins to believe that their relationship has crumbled. As a result, she realizes it was her love for Mal that made her hide her power since childhood. It’s only then that Alina can use her power without assistance. The Darkling and Baghra agree that she’s not powerful enough on her own to be able to manipulate the Fold, so the Darkling makes plans to find her an amplifier. He plans on making an amplifier from the horns of a legendary Morozovan stag which Baghra insists does not exist. One winter night, the Darkling surprises Alina by kissing her. 
The Darkling insists that Alina focus on honing her magic while he has his men search for the stag. On the night of the King’s winter fete, Alina participates in a demonstration of her power with the Darkling. Afterward, the Darkling and Alina escape to a secluded room and kiss passionately. Alina feels overwhelmed by the Darkling’s power, but she senses something strange about his actions. Soon, the Darkling leaves to follow up on a report about the stag. On her way back to her dormitory, Alina sees Mal walking through the hallway. Mal has been tracking the stag for the Darkling and has not received any of Alina’s letters. The two have a heated argument and part on bad terms.  
Alina is surprised later that night when Baghra arrives at her room and insists that she leave the capital. Baghra reveals that the Darkling is intending to use the stag’s antlers to control her power and expand the Fold instead of shrinking it. She also divulges that she is the Darkling’s mother and that the Darkling is the Black Heretic, the figure that created the Fold centuries ago. Convinced of the Darkling’s evil, Alina leaves Os Alta, hiding among performers departing the palace. She heads west and keeps herself as inconspicuous as possible. But Alina is forced to use her powers to defend herself which reveals who she is to nearby soldiers. Alina flees from the Darkling’s men into the forest, but they pursue her. Alina avoids them for some time before Mal rescues her and leads her to safety.  
When Alina reveals the Darkling’s plan to him, the pair formulates a plan to get to the stag before the Darkling, relying on Mal’s skills as a tracker. They search for the stag, travelling far north. Their journey is a hard one, punctuated by freezing temperatures, difficult terrain, and dangerous interactions with people on the road. One night Mal confesses his longtime feelings for Alina and they kiss. Then, Morozova’s herd wanders close to their camp. But rather than killing the stag, Alina chooses to spare its life. She is determined to find another way to defeat the Darkling. Just then, the Darkling’s men emerge from the woods in ambush. The Darkling takes the pair prisoner and kills the stag. He has the antlers permanently fastened around Alina’s neck and seizes control of her power.  
The Darkling takes Alina and Mal to the Shadow Fold, along with emissaries from the surrounding countries. Then he uses Alina’s powers to illuminate a wide path through the Fold, sending the volcra reeling away. The Darkling suddenly extends the Fold, which swallows up the village of Novokribirsk, as a demonstration of his power. He threatens to use the Fold as a weapon against any country that opposes him.  
As a final act of cruelty, the Darkling orders Mal to be thrown to the volcra. Horrified and furious, Alina tries to resist the Darkling’s power and keep Mal safe, but she’s unable to gain control. But as the darkness closes in on Mal, Alina has an epiphany. By showing the stag mercy and sparing its life, she has just as much power over the amplifier as the man who killed the stag. Alina suddenly regains control over her power and saves Mal. Though she tries to turn the other Grisha against the Darkling, none of them comply. She uses the powerful Grisha ability known as the Cut to first destroy the skiff’s masts and then to tear the entire skiff in half. Alina and Mal leave the Fold behind. They are unsure whether the Darkling has survived. They flee into the west and cross the True Sea to escape."
Months,"In a style that is epic in scope yet intensely personal in focus, Laura Esquivel's Like Water For Chocolate tells the story of Tita De La Garza, the youngest daughter in a family living in Mexico at the turn of the twentieth century. Through twelve chapters, each marked as a ""monthly installment"" and thus labeled with the months of the year, we learn of Tita's struggle to pursue true love and claim her independence. Each installment features a recipe to begin each chapter. The structure of Like Water For Chocolate is wholly dependent on these recipes, as the main episodes of each chapter generally involve the preparation or consumption of the dishes that these recipes yield. The details of additional secondary recipes are woven throughout the narrative.

Like Water For Chocolate tells the story of Tita De La Garza, the youngest daughter in a family living in Mexico at the turn of the twentieth century. Tita's love, Pedro Muzquiz, comes to the family's ranch to ask for Tita's hand in marriage. Because Tita is the youngest daughter she is forbidden by a family tradition upheld by her tyrannical mother, Mama Elena, to marry. Pedro marries Tita's oldest sister, Rosaura, instead, but declares to his father that he has only married Rosaura to remain close to Tita. Rosaura and Pedro live on the family ranch, offering Pedro contact with Tita. When Tita cooks a special meal with the petals of a rose given to her by Pedro, the still-fiery force of their love (transmitted through the food) has an intense effect on Mama Elena's second daughter, Gertrudis, who is whipped into a lustful state and flees the ranch in the arms of a revolutionary soldier. Meanwhile, Rosaura gives birth to a son, who is delivered by Tita. Tita treats her nephew, Roberto, as if he were her own child, to the point that she is able to produce breast milk to feed him while her sister is dry.
Sensing that Roberto is drawing Pedro and Tita closer together, Mama Elena arranges for Rosaura's family to move to San Antonio. This separation devastates Tita. A short time later, news arrives that Roberto has died, most likely due to his removal from Tita's care. The death of her nephew causes Tita to have a breakdown, and Mama Elena sends her to an asylum. Dr. John Brown, a local American doctor, takes pity on Tita and brings her to live in his house. He patiently nurses Tita back to health, caring for her physical ailments and trying to revive her broken spirit. After some time, Tita is nearly well, and she decides never to return to the ranch. No sooner has she made this choice than Mama Elena is injured in a raid by rebel soldiers, forcing Tita to return. Tita hopes to care for her mother, but Mama Elena bitterly rejects Tita's good will. She refuses Tita's cooking, claiming that it is poisoned. Not long after, Mama Elena is found dead from an overdose of a strong emetic she consumed for fear of poisoning.
The death of Mama Elena frees Tita from the curse of her birthright and she accepts an engagement proposal from John Brown, with whom she has fallen in love. In the meantime, Rosaura and Pedro have returned to the ranch and have produced a second child, Esperanza. Immediately, Pedro's presence throws into question Tita's love for John. The night that John officially asks Pedro to bless the marriage, Pedro corners Tita in a hidden room and makes love to her, taking her virginity. Soon after, Tita is certain that she is pregnant and knows that she will have to end her engagement to John. The affair between Pedro and Tita prompts the return of Mama Elena, who comes in spirit form to curse Tita and her unborn child. Tita is distraught and has no one in whom she can confide.
In the midst of Tita's despair, the long-lost Gertrudis returns to the ranch as a general in the revolutionary army, at the helm of a regiment of fifty men. Tita is overjoyed at the return of Gertrudis, who is just the companion she seeks. Gertrudis forces Tita to tell Pedro about the pregnancy. He is gladdened at the news, and he drunkenly serenades Tita from below her window. Outraged, Mama Elena's ghost returns, violently threatening Tita and declaring that she must leave the ranch. For the first time, Tita stands up to Mama Elena and, in forceful words, declares her autonomy, banishing her mother's spirit, which shrinks from an imposing presence into a tiny fiery light. As she expels the ghost, Tita is simultaneously relieved of all her symptoms of pregnancy. The light from Mama Elena's ghost bursts through Tita's window and onto the patio below where Pedro still sits, setting fire to his entire body. After rescuing Pedro, Tita is consumed with caring for him and helping him recover. John Brown returns from a trip to the United States and Tita confesses to him her relations with Pedro. John replies that he still wishes to marry her but that she must decide for herself with whom she wishes to spend her life.
Years pass, and the ranch focuses its attention on another wedding, this time between Esperanza and Alex, the son of John Brown. Rosaura has died, freeing her only daughter, Esperanza, from the stricture that had previously forbidden her, as it had Tita, from marrying. With Rosaura dead and Esperanza married, Tita and Pedro are finally free to express their love in the open. On their first night together, Tita and Pedro experience love so intense that both are led to a tunnel that will carry them to the afterlife. Tita turns back, wanting to continue in life and in love with Pedro. Once she does, she realizes that Pedro has already crossed over. Wanting desperately to be with him, Tita attempts to ignite her inner fire by eating the candles that had lit the room until they extinguished themselves at the moment of Pedro's death. When she succeeds in recreating the climate of true passion, she reenters the luminous tunnel and meets Pedro in the spirit world. The final union of their bodies and spirits sets fire to the entire ranch, and the only remnant left of their love is the recipe book in which Tita recorded her wisdom."
Incidental,"Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl opens with an introduction in which the author, Harriet Jacobs, states her reasons for writing an autobiography. Her story is painful, and she would rather have kept it private, but she feels that making it public may help the anti-slavery movement. A preface by abolitionist Lydia Maria Child makes a similar case for the book and states that the events it records are true.
Harriet Jacobs uses the pseudonym Linda Brent to narrate her first-person account. 
Born into slavery, Linda spends her early years in a happy home with her mother and father. When her mother dies, six-year-old Linda is sent to live with the ""mistress,"" who treats her well and even teaches her to read and write. After a few years, this woman dies and bequeaths Linda to a relative. 
Linda's new masters are cruel and neglectful. Dr. Flint, the father of the woman Linda has been bequeathed to, soon begins pressuring Linda to have a sexual relationship with him. Linda struggles against Flint’s overtures for several years. He pressures and threatens her, and she defies and outwits him. Knowing that Flint will eventually get his way, Linda consents to a love affair with a white neighbor, Mr. Sands, saying that, while she is ashamed of this illicit relationship, she finds it preferable to being raped by the loathsome Dr. Flint.
Linda has two children, Benny and Ellen, with Mr. Sands. She argues that a powerless slave girl cannot be held to the same standards of morality as a free woman. She also has practical reasons for agreeing to the affair: she hopes that when Flint finds out about it, he will sell her to Sands in disgust. Instead, the vengeful Flint sends Linda to his plantation to be broken in as a field hand.
When she discovers that Benny and Ellen are to receive similar treatment, Linda hatches a desperate plan. Escaping to the North with two small children would be impossible. Unwilling to submit to Dr. Flint’s abuse, but equally unwilling to abandon her family, she hides in the attic crawl space in the house of her grandmother, who is called Aunt Martha. She hopes that Dr. Flint, under the false impression that she has gone North, will sell her children rather than risk having them disappear as well.
Linda is overjoyed when Dr. Flint sells Benny and Ellen to a slave trader who is secretly representing Mr. Sands. Mr. Sands promises to free the children one day and sends them to live with Aunt Martha. But Linda’s triumph comes at a high price. The longer she stays in her tiny garret, where she can neither sit nor stand, the more physically debilitated she becomes. Her only pleasure is to watch her children through a tiny peephole, as she cannot risk letting them know where she is. Mr. Sands marries and becomes a congressman. He brings Ellen to Washington, D.C., to look after his newborn daughter, and Linda realizes that Mr. Sands may never free her children. Worried that he will eventually sell them to slave traders, she determines that she must somehow flee with them to the North. However, Dr. Flint continues to hunt for her, and escape remains too risky.
After seven years in the attic, Linda finally escapes to the North by boat. Benny remains with Aunt Martha, and Linda is reunited with Ellen, who is now nine years old and living in Brooklyn, New York. Linda is dismayed to find that her daughter is still held in virtual slavery by Mr. Sands’s cousin, Mrs. Hobbs. She fears that Mrs. Hobbs will take Ellen back to the South, putting her beyond Linda’s reach forever.
Linda finds work as a nursemaid for a New York City family, the Bruces, who treat her very kindly. Dr. Flint continues to pursue Linda, and she flees to Boston. There, she is reunited with Benny. Dr. Flint now claims that the sale of Benny and Ellen was illegitimate, and Linda is terrified that he will re-enslave all of them. After a few years, Mrs. Bruce dies, and Linda spends some time living with her children in Boston. She also spends a year in England caring for Mr. Bruce’s daughter, and for the first time in her life she enjoys freedom from racial prejudice.
When Linda returns to Boston, Ellen goes to boarding school and Benny moves to California with Linda’s brother William. Mr. Bruce remarries, and Linda takes a position caring for their new baby. Dr. Flint dies, but his daughter, Emily, writes to Linda to claim ownership of her. The Fugitive Slave Act is passed by Congress, making Linda extremely vulnerable to kidnapping and re-enslavement.
Emily Flint and her husband, Mr. Dodge, arrive in New York to capture Linda. Linda goes into hiding, and the new Mrs. Bruce offers to purchase her freedom. Linda refuses, unwilling to be bought and sold yet again, and makes plans to follow Benny to California. Mrs. Bruce buys Linda anyway. Linda is devastated at being sold and furious with Emily Flint and the whole slave system.
However, Linda says she remains grateful to Mrs. Bruce, who is still her employer when she writes the book. She notes that she still has not yet realized her dream of making a home for herself and her children to share. The book closes with two testimonials to its accuracy, one from Amy Post, a white abolitionist, and the other from George W. Lowther, a Black anti-slavery writer."
Eyes,"Janie Crawford, an attractive, confident, middle-aged Black woman, returns to Eatonville, Florida, after a long absence. The Black townspeople gossip about her and speculate about where she has been and what has happened to her young husband, Tea Cake. They take her confidence as aloofness, but Janie’s friend Pheoby Watson sticks up for her. Pheoby visits her to find out what has happened. Their conversation frames the story that Janie relates.
Janie explains that her grandmother raised her after her mother ran off. Nanny loves her granddaughter and is dedicated to her, but her life as a slave and experience with her own daughter, Janie’s mother, has warped her worldview. Her primary desire is to marry Janie as soon as possible to a husband who can provide security and social status for her. She finds a much older farmer named Logan Killicks and insists that Janie marry him.
After moving in with Logan, Janie is miserable. Logan is pragmatic and unromantic and, in general, treats her like a pack mule. One day, Joe Starks, a smooth-tongued and ambitious man, ambles down the road in front of the farm. He and Janie flirt in secret for a couple weeks before she runs off and marries him.
Janie and Jody, as she calls him, travel to all-Black Eatonville, where Jody hopes to have a “big voice.” A consummate politician, Jody soon succeeds in becoming the mayor, postmaster, storekeeper, and the biggest landlord in town. But Janie seeks something more than a man with a big voice. She soon becomes disenchanted with the monotonous, stifling life that she shares with Jody. She wishes that she could be a part of the rich social life in town, but Jody doesn’t allow her to interact with “common” people. Jody sees Janie as the fitting ornament to his wealth and power, and he tries to shape her into his vision of what a mayor’s wife should be. On the surface, Janie silently submits to Jody; inside, however, she remains passionate and full of dreams.
After almost two decades of marriage, Janie finally asserts herself. When Jody insults her appearance, Janie rips him to shreds in front of the townspeople, telling them all how ugly and impotent he is. In retaliation, he savagely beats her. Their marriage breaks down, and Jody becomes quite ill. After months without interacting, Janie visits him on his deathbed. Refusing to be silenced, she once again chastises him for the way that he treated her. As she berates him, he dies.
After Jody’s funeral, Janie feels free for the first time in years. She rebuffs various suitors who come to court her because she loves her newfound independence. But when Tea Cake, a man twelve years her junior, enters her life, Janie immediately senses a spark of mutual attraction. She begins dating Tea Cake despite critical gossip within the town. To everyone’s shock, Janie then marries Tea Cake nine months after Jody’s death, sells Jody’s store, and leaves town to go with Tea Cake to Jacksonville.
During the first week of their marriage, Tea Cake and Janie encounter difficulties. He steals her money and leaves her alone one night, making her think that he married her only for her money. But he returns, explaining that he never meant to leave her and that his theft occurred in a moment of weakness. Afterward, they promise to share all their experiences and opinions with each other. They move to the Everglades, where they work during the harvest season and socialize during the summer off-season. Tea Cake’s quick wit and friendliness make their shack the center of entertainment and social life.
A terrible hurricane bursts into the Everglades two years after Janie and Tea Cake’s marriage. As they desperately flee the rising waters, a rabid dog bites Tea Cake. At the time, Tea Cake doesn’t realize the dog’s condition; three weeks later, however, he falls ill. During a rabies--induced bout of madness, Tea Cake becomes convinced that Janie is cheating on him. He starts firing a pistol at her and Janie is forced to kill him to save her life. She is immediately put on trial for murder, but the all-white, all-male jury finds her not guilty. She returns to Eatonville where her former neighbors are ready to spin malicious gossip about her circumstances, assuming that Tea Cake has left her and taken her money. Janie wraps up her recounting to Pheoby, who is greatly impressed by Janie’s experiences. Back in her room that night, Janie feels at one with Tea Cake and at peace with herself."
Philanthropist,"Bigger Thomas, a poor, uneducated, twenty-year-old Black man in 1930s Chicago, wakes up one morning in his family’s cramped apartment on the South Side of the city. He sees a huge rat scamper across the room, which he corners and kills with a skillet. Having grown up under the climate of harsh racial prejudice in 1930s America, Bigger is burdened with a powerful conviction that he has no control over his life and that he cannot aspire to anything other than menial, low-wage labor. His mother pesters him to take a job with a rich white man named Mr. Dalton, but Bigger instead chooses to meet up with his friends to plan the robbery of a white man’s store.
Anger, fear, and frustration define Bigger’s daily existence, as he is forced to hide behind a façade of toughness or risk succumbing to despair. While Bigger and his gang have robbed many Black-owned businesses, they have never attempted to rob a white man. Bigger sees whites not as individuals, but as a natural, oppressive force—a great looming “whiteness” pressing down upon him. Bigger’s fear of confronting this force overwhelms him, but rather than admit his fear, he violently attacks a member of his gang to sabotage the robbery. Left with no other options, Bigger takes a job as a chauffeur for the Daltons.
Coincidentally, Mr. Dalton is also Bigger’s landlord, as he owns a controlling share of the company that manages the apartment building where Bigger’s family lives. Mr. Dalton and other wealthy real estate barons are effectively robbing the poor, Black tenants on Chicago’s South Side—they refuse to allow Black people to rent apartments in predominantly white neighborhoods, thus leading to overpopulation and artificially high rents in the predominantly Black South Side. Mr. Dalton sees himself as a benevolent philanthropist, however, as he donates money to Black schools and offers jobs to “poor, timid black boys” like Bigger. However, Mr. Dalton practices this token philanthropy mainly to alleviate his guilty conscience for exploiting poor Black people.
Mary, Mr. Dalton’s daughter, frightens and angers Bigger by ignoring the social taboos that govern the relations between white women and Black men. On his first day of work, Bigger drives Mary to meet her communist boyfriend, Jan. Eager to prove their progressive ideals and racial tolerance, Mary and Jan force Bigger to take them to a restaurant in the South Side. Despite Bigger’s embarrassment, they order drinks, and as the evening passes, all three of them get drunk. Bigger then drives around the city while Mary and Jan make out in the back seat. Afterward, Mary is too drunk to make it to her bedroom on her own, so Bigger helps her up the stairs. Drunk and aroused by his unprecedented proximity to a young white woman, Bigger begins to kiss Mary.
Just as Bigger places Mary on her bed, Mary’s blind mother, Mrs. Dalton, enters the bedroom. Though Mrs. Dalton cannot see him, her ghostlike presence terrifies him. Bigger worries that Mary, in her drunken condition, will reveal his presence. He covers her face with a pillow and accidentally smothers her to death. Unaware that Mary has been killed, Mrs. Dalton prays over her daughter and returns to bed. Bigger tries to conceal his crime by burning Mary’s body in the Daltons’ furnace. He decides to try to use the Daltons’ prejudice against communists to frame Jan for Mary’s disappearance. Bigger believes that the Daltons will assume Jan is dangerous and that he may have kidnapped their daughter for political purposes. Additionally, Bigger takes advantage of the Daltons’ racial prejudices to avoid suspicion, continuing to play the role of a timid, ignorant Black servant who would be unable to commit such an act.
Mary’s murder gives Bigger a sense of power and identity he has never known. Bigger’s girlfriend, Bessie, makes an offhand comment that inspires him to try to collect ransom money from the Daltons. They know only that Mary has vanished, not that she is dead. Bigger writes a ransom letter, playing upon the Daltons’ hatred of communists by signing his name “Red.” He then bullies Bessie to take part in the ransom scheme. However, Mary’s bones are found in the furnace, and Bigger flees with Bessie to an empty building. Bigger rapes Bessie and, frightened that she will give him away, bludgeons her to death with a brick after she falls asleep.
Bigger eludes the massive manhunt for as long as he can, but he is eventually captured after a dramatic shoot-out. The press and the public determine his guilt and his punishment before his trial even begins. The furious populace assumes that he raped Mary before killing her and burned her body to hide the evidence of the rape. Moreover, the white authorities and the white mob use Bigger’s crime as an excuse to terrorize the entire South Side .
Jan visits Bigger in jail. He says that he understands how he terrified, angered, and shamed Bigger through his violation of the social taboos that govern tense race relations. Jan enlists his friend, Boris A. Max, to defend Bigger free of charge. Jan and Max speak with Bigger as a human being, and Bigger begins to see whites as individuals and himself as their equal.
Max tries to save Bigger from the death penalty, arguing that while his client is responsible for his crime, it is vital to recognize that he is a product of his environment. Part of the blame for Bigger’s crimes belongs to the fearful, hopeless existence that he has experienced in a racist society since birth. Max warns that there will be more men like Bigger if America does not put an end to the vicious cycle of hatred and vengeance. Despite Max’s arguments, Bigger is sentenced to death.
Bigger is not a traditional hero by any means. However, Wright forces us to enter into Bigger’s mind and to understand the devastating effects of the social conditions in which he was raised. Bigger was not born a violent criminal. He is a “native son”: a product of American culture and the violence and racism that suffuse it."
Clocks,"A Clockwork Orange takes place in a futuristic city governed by a repressive, totalitarian super-State. In this society, ordinary citizens have fallen into a passive stupor of complacency, blind to the insidious growth of a rampant, violent youth culture. The protagonist of the story is Alex, a fifteen-year-old boy who narrates in a teenage slang called nadsat, which incorporates elements of Russian and Cockney English. Alex leads a small gang of teenage criminals—Dim, Pete, and Georgie—through the streets, robbing and beating men and raping women. Alex and his friends spend the rest of their time at the Korova Milkbar, an establishment that serves milk laced with drugs, and a bar called the Duke of New York.
Alex begins his narrative from the Korova, where the boys sit around drinking. When Alex and his gang leave the bar, they go on a crime spree that involves mugging, robbery, a gang fight, auto theft, breaking and entering, and rape. The last of these crimes is particularly brutal. The boys travel to the countryside with their stolen car, break into a cottage and beat up the man inside before raping his wife while making him watch. They then head back to the Korova, where they fight with each other. Alex, who loves classical music, becomes angry at Dim when Dim mocks an opera that Alex likes. Alex punches Dim in the face, which prompts the others to turn against their arrogant leader. The next time they go out, they break into an old woman’s house. She calls the police, and before Alex can get away, Dim hits him in the eye with a chain and runs away with the others. The police apprehend Alex and take him to the station, where he later learns that the woman he beat and raped during the earlier robbery has died. 
Alex is sentenced to fourteen years in prison. At first, prison is difficult for him. The guards are merciless and oppressive, and several of the other prisoners want to rape him. After a few years, though, prison life becomes easier. He befriends the prison chaplain, who notices Alex’s interest in the Bible. The chaplain lets Alex read in the chapel while listening to classical music, and Alex pores over the Old Testament, delighting in the sex, drinking, and fighting he finds in its pages. 
One day, after fighting with and killing a cellmate, Alex is selected as the first candidate for an experimental treatment called Ludovico’s Technique, a form of brainwashing that incorporates associative learning. After being injected with a substance that makes him dreadfully sick, the doctors force Alex to watch exceedingly violent movies. In this way, Alex comes to associate violence with the nausea and headaches he experiences from the shot. The process takes two weeks to complete, after which the mere thought of violence has the power to make Alex ill. As an unintended consequence of the treatment, Alex can no longer enjoy classical music, which he has always associated with violence. This side effect doesn’t bother the State, which considers Alex’s successful treatment a victory for law and order and plans to implement it on a large scale.
After two years in prison, Alex is released, a harmless human being incapable of vicious acts. Soon, however, Alex finds he’s not only harmless but also defenseless, as his earlier victims begin to take revenge on him. His old friend Dim and an old enemy named Billyboy are both police officers now, and they take the opportunity to settle old scores. They drive him to a field in the country, beat him, and leave him in the rain. Looking for charity, Alex wanders to a nearby cottage and knocks on the door, begging for help. The man living there lets him in and gives him food and a room for the night. Alex recognizes him from two years ago as the man whose wife he raped, but the man does not recognize Alex, who wore a mask that night. Alex learns later in the night that the man’s wife died of shock shortly after being raped. 
This man, F. Alexander, is a political dissident. When he hears Alex’s story, he thinks he can use Alex to incite public outrage against the State. He and three of his colleagues develop a plan for Alex to make several public appearances. Alex, however, is tired of being exploited for other people’s schemes. He berates the men in nadsat, which arouses the suspicion of F. Alexander, who still remembers the strange language spoken by the teenagers who raped his wife. Based on F. Alexander’s suspicion, the men change their plans. They lock Alex in an apartment and blast classical music through the wall, hoping to drive Alex to suicide so they can blame the government. 
Alex does, in fact, hurl himself out of an attic window, but the fall doesn’t kill him. While he lies in the hospital, unconscious, a political struggle ensues, but the current administration survives. State doctors undo Ludovico’s Technique and restore Alex’s old vicious self in exchange for Alex’s endorsement. Back to normal, Alex assembles a new gang and engages in the same behavior as he did before prison, but he soon begins to tire of a life of violence. After running into his old friend Pete, who is now married and living a normal life, Alex decides that such a life is what he wants for himself. His final thoughts are of his future son."
Talk,"Speak, by Laurie Halse Anderson, chronicles the struggles of thirteen-year-old Melinda Sordino after she is a raped by at a party the summer before her freshman year of high school by another student. Melinda tells her story in first person narrative. She describes events within the framework of the four marking periods of the school year.
In the opening part of Speak, “First Marking Period,” Melinda begins high school, and we learn that former friends now hate her. She experiences humiliation in the cafeteria and Mr. Neck, a social studies teacher, further embarrasses her by giving her demerits on the first day of school. Ostracized by her former friends, she befriends Heather, a new girl at the school. Heather seeks popularity, and she badgers Melinda to join various clubs. Rachel, Melinda’s ex-best friend, hasn’t tried to find out the truth about what really happened to Melinda that night at the party over the summer.
Melinda describes her classes, activities, and thoughts. Her project in Mr. Freeman’s art class is to create a work of art based on a “tree,” which is the object named on the piece of paper she randomly chooses. In biology, Melinda thinks that David Petrakis, her lab partner, might be cute without the braces. And in algebra, when Mr. Stetman has Rachel come to the board to help Melinda with a problem, Melinda is humiliated. 
Melinda often skips class using stolen late passes and doesn’t complete her homework. She finds refuge at school in a vacant janitor’s closet, which she turns into her “burrow.” At the Homecoming Rally, students bully her for being the one who called the cops that night at the party.
At home, Melinda and her parents communicate with each other by leaving notes on the refrigerator. In her bedroom, she no longer wants to look in the mirror and puts it in the back of her closet. Toward the end of the marking period, Melinda’s parents hear from the school about her missing work, and she remains silent while they berate her for failing. Through it all, Melinda sees “IT” everywhere, the nightmare from which she cannot awaken.
In “Second Marking Period,” school is a grind for Melinda. At her parents’ insistence, she stays after to finish her homework, but she goes to her burrow and naps instead. In social studies, David Petrakis stands up against Mr. Neck’s racist rant about immigration. In biology, she finds that a seed within the apple she has cut is already growing. Heather gives her an early Christmas present, and Melinda decides she’ll give Heather a friendship necklace. 
On Christmas, Melinda nearly tells her parents what happened that night last summer but can’t. Winter break is miserable. Her parents keep her busy working for them, and she is relieved when school starts again. 
In gym class, Melinda impresses the basketball coaches with skills but has no interest in being on the team. She reluctantly helps Heather in her attempts to become an initiated member of a do-good club. And in biology, when she and David dissect a frog, she faints when preparing to slice it open. 
Melinda’s parents receive another call from the guidance counselor about her grades. After their verbal assault, Melinda goes to her room and uses an open paper clip to scrape at her wrist. 
“IT”, who we learn is Andy Evans, harasses Melinda in the cafeteria, and she runs to the bathroom to vomit. She has yet to tell anyone, even the reader, about what happened that summer night.
In “Third Marking Period,” Melinda continues to skip school and avoid Andy Evans. Heather ends their friendship suddenly, and later returns the friendship necklace Melinda had given her for Christmas. No one, Melinda is sure, “would like the inside girl I think I am.” 
The school counselors hold another meeting with Melinda’s parents, who berate and threaten her. She refuses to talk or defend herself. She receives In-School Suspension, and IT is there. He sits next to her and blows in her ear when Mr. Neck isn’t looking. 
In art class, Mr. Freeman gives Melinda a book about Picasso to help her “paralyzed” imagination. Picasso’s art inspires her, and she begins to draw. Mr. Freeman recognizes that she has a lot to say.
Melinda works to meet the expectations set for her. Yet, with “no friends in the known universe,” Melinda sits alone at lunch, wondering if everyone is talking and laughing about her. 
One afternoon, after a basketball game, David Petrakis invites her to his house for pizza to celebrate the team’s one-point win. She declines, torn between getting a life, and the fact that the world is a dangerous place.
At last, Melinda reveals that she was attacked at a party last summer, though she does not use the word “rape.” At this point, we (the readers) are the only ones besides Melinda who know what happened.
In “Fourth Marking Period,” Melinda takes her ex-friend Ivy’s advice and tries drawing a tree instead of carving one from linoleum block. She also learns that Rachel is dating Andy Evans. Compelled to do something, she writes a note to Rachel warning her about Andy. In the note, she admits for the first time (but without divulging her identity), that she was raped. 
Springtime arrives, and Melinda finds solace working in the garden. She and David plan a protest in social studies class over an oral report she is supposed to present, and she stands up to Heather by refusing to help her decorate for the Senior Prom. She writes on a stall in the bathroom, “Guys to Stay Away From: Andy Evans.” Andy Evans continues to bully her. 
Melinda feels compelled to tell Rachel the truth about Andy and what happened that night. But, when Rachel learns that Andy Evans was Melinda’s attacker, she accuses Melinda of being jealous and calls her a “twisted little freak.” Later, Ivy brings Melinda into the bathroom stall. Other girls have added words like “creep” and “bastard” under Andy Evan’s name. Seeing that, Melinda feels like she can fly.
Melinda realizes she doesn’t need her burrow anymore. When she is clearing her items out of the closet, Andy Evans barges in, attacks Melinda, and tries to rape her again. She finds her voice and screams “NNNOOO!!” He does not back off, so Melinda breaks a mirror, takes a shard of glass, and holds it to his neck. “I said no,” she tells him. People who had heard her scream run for help.
With hours left in the school year, Melinda finds herself a sort of hero. She finishes her tree project, receiving an A+ from Mr. Freeman."
Qualifications,"Educated is primarily retrospective, consisting of Tara Westover's memories about her past. She tells the story of the events of her life from a vantage point in her late twenties, occasionally interjecting to comment on the process of trying to arrive at an accurate version of the past. Tara was born the youngest of seven children to parents whom she refers to as Faye and Gene (pseudonyms). The Westover family lived on a farm in rural Idaho, where Gene made a living salvaging scrap metal while Faye worked as an unlicensed midwife and herbal healer. Gene suffered from paranoid fears about interference from the federal government, and as a result he refused to allow his children to attend school, receive birth certificates, or receive medical attention. Gene was also a devout Mormon who believed in radical self-sufficiency and an impending Day of Judgement.
		
Shifts in the Westover family dynamic began to emerge when Tara was about nine. Her mother's work as a midwife increased her sense of independence, but after sustaining a serious and untreated brain injury in a car accident, Faye began to lose confidence in her skills, and focused instead on using herbal remedies and a form of intuitive healing. Around this time, Tyler (the third son) announced that he was going to attend college, which estranged him from his family. Tyler's absence forced Tara to become more involved in helping her father with his scrapping work, which left her constantly exposed to the possibility of dangerous injury. It also made her more curious about possibly pursuing an education herself. When Tara was ten, she told her disapproving father that she wanted to begin going to school, but nothing came of the idea.
As Tara grew into her teens, she acquired more independence from her family due to taking on various jobs and pursuing singing and musical theatre in the local community. However, her life was dominated by the strict rules and religious doctrine her father imposed, and Tara often worried about becoming sinful. When Tara was thirteen, her older brother Shawn moved back home. At first Shawn and Tara were close and spent a lot of time together. When Tara was about fifteen, however, Shawn began to be physically abusive toward her. His behavior only got worse after Shawn experienced a head injury. Tyler eventually realized that Shawn was hurting Tara, and he urged Tara to seriously consider applying to college and getting away from the family. Although she was uncertain at first, Tara began to study and was eventually accepted at Brigham Young University, having passed herself off as homeschooled.
In January 2004, when Tara was seventeen years old, she moved to Utah to begin her college education. She found the adjustment very difficult at first, but eventually began to excel in her studies. Tara's finances were precarious, and she had to hold multiple jobs and maintain very high grades to retain her scholarship. Her emerging independence also caused a threatening dynamic between her, Gene, and Shawn. Whenever Tara returned to Buck's Peak, her father manipulated her into working for him, while Shawn continued to physically and emotionally abuse her. Tara eventually confided to a bishop about her life, and he helped her to secure funding to finance her education. Tara's studies, and the people she met, also gradually opened her eyes to different realities and force her to realize how damaging and isolating her childhood has been. Tara eventually changed her major to studying history, and is encouraged to apply for a study abroad program at Cambridge University in England.
Tara's experience at Cambridge broadened her horizons even further, and she was encouraged to consider graduate studies. Tara still felt isolated from her peers, and ashamed of her origins. She hid most of her past even from her friends and the men she occasionally dated. She was eventually awarded a prestigious Cambridge Gates Fellowship and moved to England to pursue a Master's degree. She remained in close contact with her family and returned to Idaho regularly to visit, but her relationship with them deteriorated. Shawn was growing increasingly erratic and violent, and Tara feared for the safety of his wife and young child. By chance, she revealed to her sister Audrey that Shawn had been abusive with her, and Audrey later confided that Shawn abused her as well. Audrey blamed herself for not protecting her younger sister, and suggested that she and Tara confront their parents and Shawn about what happened to them.
By then Tara had built a happy life for herself in England, and was working on a PhD in history at Cambridge. However, the attempt to speak the truth quickly became a source of conflict in the family. Tara became more and more ostracized within her family, eventually culminating in Shawn learning that she had been telling their parents about the abuse she suffered. Realizing her family would never trust her claims, Tara became estranged from most of them, with the exception of Tyler.  The estrangement from her family prompted grief and depression for Tara, but she was finally able to heal, and successfully completed her PhD. By the end of her memoir, Tara has accepted that she may never have a relationship with her family again, but she takes pride in the independence she has established, and the life she has built for herself."
Amongst,"Two migrant workers, George and Lennie, have been let off a bus miles away from the California farm where they are due to start work. George is a small, dark man with “sharp, strong features.” Lennie, his companion, is his opposite, a giant of a man with a “shapeless” face. Overcome with thirst, the two stop in a clearing by a pool and decide to camp for the night. As the two converse, it becomes clear that Lennie has an intellectual disability, and is deeply devoted to George and dependent upon him for protection and guidance. George finds that Lennie, who loves petting soft things but often accidentally kills them, has been carrying and stroking a dead mouse. George angrily throws it away, fearing that Lennie might catch a disease from the dead animal. George complains loudly that his life would be easier without having to care for Lennie, but the reader senses that their friendship and devotion is mutual. He and Lennie share a dream of buying their own piece of land, farming it, and, much to Lennie’s delight, keeping rabbits. George ends the night by treating Lennie to the story he often tells him about what life will be like in such an idyllic place.
The next day, the men report to the nearby ranch. George, fearing how the boss will react to Lennie, insists that he’ll do all the talking. He lies, explaining that they travel together because they are cousins and that a horse kicked Lennie in the head when he was a child. They are hired. They meet Candy, an old “swamper,” or handyman, with a missing hand and an ancient dog, and Curley, the boss’s mean-spirited son. Curley is newly married, possessive of his flirtatious wife, and full of jealous suspicion. Once George and Lennie are alone in the bunkhouse, Curley’s wife appears and flirts with them. Lennie thinks she is “purty,” but George, sensing the trouble that could come from tangling with this woman and her husband, warns Lennie to stay away from her. Soon, the ranch-hands return from the fields for lunch, and George and Lennie meet Slim, the skilled mule driver who wields great authority on the ranch. Slim comments on the rarity of friendship like that between George and Lennie. Carlson, another ranch-hand, suggests that since Slim’s dog has just given birth, they should offer a puppy to Candy and shoot Candy’s old, good-for-nothing dog.
The next day, George confides in Slim that he and Lennie are not cousins, but have been friends since childhood. He tells how Lennie has often gotten them into trouble. For instance, they were forced to flee their last job because Lennie tried to touch a woman’s dress and was accused of rape. Slim agrees to give Lennie one of his puppies, and Carlson continues to badger Candy to kill his old dog. When Slim agrees with Carlson, saying that death would be a welcome relief to the suffering animal, Candy gives in. Carlson, before leading the dog outside, promises to do the job painlessly.
Slim goes to the barn to do some work, and Curley, who is maniacally searching for his wife, heads to the barn to accost Slim. Candy overhears George and Lennie discussing their plans to buy land, and offers his life’s savings if they will let him live there too. The three make a pact to let no one else know of their plan. Slim returns to the bunkhouse, berating Curley for his suspicions. Curley, searching for an easy target for his anger, finds Lennie and picks a fight with him. Lennie crushes Curley’s hand in the altercation. Slim warns Curley that if he tries to get George and Lennie fired, he will be the laughingstock of the farm.
The next night, most of the men go to the local brothel. Lennie is left with Crooks, the lonely, Black stable-hand, and Candy. Curley’s wife flirts with them, refusing to leave until the other men come home. She notices the cuts on Lennie’s face and suspects that he, and not a piece of machinery as Curley claimed, is responsible for hurting her husband. This thought amuses her. The next day, Lennie accidentally kills his puppy in the barn. Curley’s wife enters and consoles him. She admits that life with Curley is a disappointment, and wishes that she had followed her dream of becoming a movie star. Lennie tells her that he loves petting soft things, and she offers to let him feel her hair. When he grabs too tightly, she cries out. In his attempt to silence her, he accidentally breaks her neck.
Lennie flees back to a pool of the Salinas River that George had designated as a meeting place should either of them get into trouble. As the men back at the ranch discover what has happened and gather together a lynch party, George joins Lennie. Much to Lennie’s surprise, George is not mad at him for doing “a bad thing.” George begins to tell Lennie the story of the farm they will have together. As he describes the rabbits that Lennie will tend, the sound of the approaching lynch party grows louder. George shoots his friend in the back of the head.
When the other men arrive, George lets them believe that Lennie had the gun, and George wrestled it away from him and shot him. Only Slim understands what has really happened, that George has killed his friend out of mercy. Slim consolingly leads him away, and the other men, completely puzzled, watch them leave."
Competing,"A Raisin in the Sun portrays a few weeks in the life of the Youngers, a Black family living on the South Side of Chicago in the 1950s. When the play opens, the Youngers are about to receive an insurance check for $10,000. This money comes from the deceased Mr. Younger’s life insurance policy. Each of the adult members of the family has an idea as to what he or she would like to do with this money. The matriarch of the family, Mama, wants to buy a house to fulfill a dream she shared with her husband. Mama’s son, Walter Lee, would rather use the money to invest in a liquor store with his friends. He believes that the investment will solve the family’s financial problems forever. Walter’s wife, Ruth, agrees with Mama, however, and hopes that she and Walter can provide more space and opportunity for their son, Travis. Finally, Beneatha, Walter’s sister and Mama’s daughter, wants to use the money for her medical school tuition. She also wishes that her family members were not so interested in assimilating into the white world. Beneatha instead tries to find her identity by looking back to the past and to Africa.
As the play progresses, the Youngers clash over their competing dreams. Ruth discovers that she is pregnant but fears that if she has the child, she will put more financial pressure on her family members. When Walter says nothing to Ruth’s admission that she is considering abortion, Mama puts a down payment on a house for the whole family. She believes that a bigger, brighter dwelling will help them all. This house is in Clybourne Park, an entirely white neighborhood. When the Youngers’ future neighbors find out that the Youngers are moving in, they send Mr. Lindner, from the Clybourne Park Improvement Association, to offer the Youngers money in return for staying away. The Youngers refuse the deal, even after Walter loses the rest of the money ($6,500) to his friend Willy Harris, who persuades Walter to invest in the liquor store and then runs off with his cash.
In the meantime, Beneatha rejects her suitor, George Murchison, whom she believes to be shallow and blind to the problems of race. Subsequently, she receives a marriage proposal from her Nigerian boyfriend, Joseph Asagai, who wants Beneatha to get a medical degree and move to Africa with him (Beneatha does not make her choice before the end of the play). The Youngers eventually move out of the apartment, fulfilling the family’s long-held dream. Their future seems uncertain and slightly dangerous, but they are optimistic and determined to live a better life. They believe that they can succeed if they stick together as a family and resolve to defer their dreams no longer."
Dogs,"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time takes place in the year 1998 in and around the town of Swindon, England. The fifteen-year-old narrator of the story, Christopher John Francis Boone, discovers the slain body of his neighbor’s poodle, Wellington, on the neighbor’s front lawn one evening and sets out to uncover the murderer. His investigation is at times aided, and at other times hampered, by the mild form of autism he lives with. After Christopher hits a policeman in a misunderstanding at the scene of the crime, the police take Christopher into custody. They release Christopher with only a stern warning, under the condition that he promises to them and to his father not to look into the murder any further.
Christopher chronicles his investigation in a book—the book we are reading—as part of a school assignment. Ignoring repeated warnings from his father, Christopher investigates the crime scene and conducts interviews with the residents of his block. He uncovers a more tangled plot than was first apparent when he discovers that his father and the owner of the slain dog, Mrs. Shears, had a romantic affair. He subsequently learns that their affair began in reaction to another relationship, one carried on between Mr. Shears and Christopher’s mother, before she disappeared from Christopher’s life.
At school, Christopher prepares for an A-level math exam that will enable him to attend a university, a feat no other child at his school has managed. He also continues to work on his book. Upon returning home one afternoon, Christopher accidentally leaves his book in plain view on the kitchen table. His father reads it, becomes angry, and confiscates it. Later, Christopher searches for the book and uncovers a series of letters, hidden in a shirt box in his father’s closet, addressed to him from his supposedly dead mother. The letters chronicle a life that his mother has continued to lead with Mr. Shears in London and contain repeated requests for Christopher to respond. In shock, Christopher passes out in his bedroom surrounded by the evidence of his father’s deception. When Father comes home and realizes what has happened, he breaks down in tears. He apologizes for his lies, explaining that he acted out of a desire to protect Christopher from the knowledge of his mother’s abandonment of the family. Christopher’s father also admits to killing Wellington after an argument with Mrs. Shears, his lover.
Christopher, now terrified of his father and feeling he can no longer trust him, sneaks out of the house and travels to London to live with his mother. During a harrowing journey, he copes with and overcomes the social fears and limitations of his condition, dodges police, and almost gets hit by a train. His arrival at his mother’s flat comes as a total surprise to her, as she had no idea that Christopher’s father had been withholding her letters. Christopher settles in for a time at his mother and Mr. Shears’s flat, but friction caused by his presence shortly results in his mother’s decision to leave Mr. Shears to return to Swindon. Christopher moves into a new apartment with his mother and begins to receive regular visits from his father. When Christopher’s pet rat Toby dies, Christopher’s father gives Christopher a puppy. At school, Christopher sits for his A-level math exam and receives an A grade, the best possible score. The novel ends with Christopher planning to take more A-level exams in physics and further math, and then attend a university in another town. He knows that he can do all of this because he solved the mystery of Wellington’s murder, was brave enough to find his mother, and wrote the book that we have read."
Mischievous,"An imaginative and mischievous boy named Tom Sawyer lives with his Aunt Polly and his half-brother, Sid, in the Mississippi River town of St. Petersburg, Missouri. After playing hooky from school on Friday and dirtying his clothes in a fight, Tom is made to whitewash the fence as punishment on Saturday. At first, Tom is disappointed by having to forfeit his day off. However, he soon cleverly persuades his friends to trade him small treasures for the privilege of doing his work. He trades these treasures for tickets given out in Sunday school for memorizing Bible verses and uses the tickets to claim a Bible as a prize. He loses much of his glory, however, when, in response to a question to show off his knowledge, he incorrectly answers that the first two disciples were David and Goliath.
Tom falls in love with Becky Thatcher, a new girl in town, and persuades her to get “engaged” to him. Their romance collapses when she learns that Tom has been “engaged” before—to a girl named Amy Lawrence. Shortly after being shunned by Becky, Tom accompanies Huckleberry Finn, the son of the town drunk, to the graveyard at night to try out a “cure” for warts. At the graveyard, they witness the murder of young Dr. Robinson by the Native-American “half-breed” Injun Joe. Scared, Tom and Huck run away and swear a blood oath not to tell anyone what they have seen. Injun Joe blames his companion, Muff Potter, a hapless drunk, for the crime. Potter is wrongfully arrested, and Tom’s anxiety and guilt begin to grow.
Tom, Huck, and Tom’s friend Joe Harper run away to an island to become pirates. While frolicking around and enjoying their newfound freedom, the boys become aware that the community is sounding the river for their bodies. Tom sneaks back home one night to observe the commotion. After a brief moment of remorse at the suffering of his loved ones, Tom is struck by the idea of appearing at his funeral and surprising everyone. He persuades Joe and Huck to do the same. Their return is met with great rejoicing, and they become the envy and admiration of all their friends.
Back in school, Tom gets himself back in Becky’s favor after he nobly accepts the blame for a book that she has ripped. Soon Muff Potter’s trial begins, and Tom, overcome by guilt, testifies against Injun Joe. Potter is acquitted, but Injun Joe flees the courtroom through a window.
Summer arrives, and Tom and Huck go hunting for buried treasure in a haunted house. After venturing upstairs they hear a noise below. Peering through holes in the floor, they see Injun Joe enter the house disguised as a deaf and mute Spaniard. He and his companion, an unkempt man, plan to bury some stolen treasure of their own. From their hiding spot, Tom and Huck wriggle with delight at the prospect of digging it up. By an amazing coincidence, Injun Joe and his partner find a buried box of gold themselves. When they see Tom and Huck’s tools, they become suspicious that someone is sharing their hiding place and carry the gold off instead of reburying it.
Huck begins to shadow Injun Joe every night, watching for an opportunity to nab the gold. Meanwhile, Tom goes on a picnic to McDougal’s Cave with Becky and their classmates. That same night, Huck sees Injun Joe and his partner making off with a box. He follows and overhears their plans to attack the Widow Douglas, a kind resident of St. Petersburg. By running to fetch help, Huck forestalls the violence and becomes an anonymous hero.
Tom and Becky get lost in the cave, and their absence is not discovered until the following morning. The men of the town begin to search for them, but to no avail. Tom and Becky run out of food and candles and begin to weaken. The horror of the situation increases when Tom, looking for a way out of the cave, happens upon Injun Joe, who is using the cave as a hideout. Eventually, just as the searchers are giving up, Tom finds a way out. The town celebrates, and Becky’s father, Judge Thatcher, locks up the cave. Injun Joe, trapped inside, starves to death.
A week later, Tom takes Huck to the cave and they find the box of gold, the proceeds of which are invested for them. The Widow Douglas adopts Huck, and, when Huck attempts to escape civilized life, Tom promises him that if he returns to the widow, he can join Tom’s robber band. Reluctantly, Huck agrees."
Shown,"In “moon,” the first of the four parts of feed, an American teenager named Titus travels to the lunar surface with his high-school friends for spring break, hoping to escape the boredom they feel on Earth. No specific date is revealed, though it’s sometime in a dystopic future, where the moon is fully commercialized and people suffer from red sores called lesions. As Titus and his fellow upper-class friends Link, Marty, Calista, Loga, and Quendy arrive on the moon, readers also get their first glimpse of “the feed.” Although Titus doesn’t initially reveal exact details about the feed or how it works, he says it sends the friends ads and images for where to stay and shop. 
After failing to get into college-age parties, the group visits the Ricochet Lounge, where Titus becomes infatuated with a girl named Violet. She is beautiful and, he soon finds, visiting the moon by herself and is very unlike his friends: She doesn’t make pointless purchases at a mall they all soon visit and isn’t interested in malfunctioning, or falling into a drug-like stupor, via their connections to the feed. Later, when they all visit a dance club called the Rumble Spot, an old man from a dissenter group called the Coalition of Pity hacks into people’s individual feeds, causing them to broadcast the signal, “we enter a time of calamity” over the feed’s network. Police beat the man and “shut off” those hacked, including Titus and Violet, who hold hands as they collapse.
Part 2, “eden,” occurs in a lunar hospital where Violet, Titus, and his friends remain disconnected from the feed until their systems can be scanned for viruses. There, Titus provides additional details about what the feed is and how it works. Feeds are implanted inside the body and connect to a global network that provides news, entertainment, and a means to purchase every kind of product, he says while singing its praises. The feed even anticipates and creates users’ wants from individual profiles based on purchasing decisions, thoughts, and feelings. Titus and Violet grow closer during the stay. Violet, who’s home-schooled and smarter than Titus and his friends, says she hoped to enjoy herself like normal kids but now has a problem, though she remains vague about what this problem is. When doctors finally restore the friends’ feeds, they rejoice. Promotions begin to flow through their minds again, though there’s also ominous news concerning protests over America’s annexation of the moon and resulting anger from a group called the Global Alliance. Still, Titus says, the friends exalt in the return of their feeds.
In Part 3, “Utopia,” Titus and his friends return to Earth and life returns to normal for them: “upcars” travel in tubes past vertically stacked suburbs, the friends party, and U.S. President Trumbull scoffs at reports that claim toxic industries cause lesions. In defiance of rampant consumerism and a loss of individuality, Violet determines to resist the feed by creating a completely random customer profile and asks Titus to join her. Violet, who didn’t receive her feed until she was seven, voices deep concern about the decline of the world and destruction of Earth, and laments how those who’ve had the feed their entire lives are ignorant and self-centered. Titus soon has nightmares that are more likely hacks from the Coalition of Pity. In them, he sees disturbing images of eco destruction and human suffering around the world, but after Violet chats him, saying she has seen the images too, he only wants to go back to sleep.
Before long, Violet’s problem becomes clear: Her body begins to fail and she’s told by doctors that the damage to her feedware can be fatal. The prognosis makes Violet realize how much she wants to do. She starts by going to the seashore with Titus, though they need to dress in protective suits due to its toxicity. Meanwhile, feed chatter reveals that all of Earth’s forests have fallen and there is a growing rift between the U.S. and the Global Alliance. At a party where Quendy shows off her artificial lesions, Violet becomes outraged and her body falters. She chastises Titus and his friends for living in ignorance as the world dies, then collapses and is brought to the hospital. 
Violet’s condition declines further in Part 4, “slumberland,” whose chapter titles track her feed efficiency from a high of 87.3 percent to a low of 4.6 percent, 98 percent being optimal. Aware that she doesn’t have much time, Violet messages Titus a list of twenty-two things she wants to do in life, though he grows increasingly distant, and doesn’t message back. When they do reconnect, Violet sends Titus a recent memory where she falls down a staircase and receives a response from the corporation FeedTech, denying her petition to pay for her system repairs because she wasn’t deemed to be worthy due to her random customer profile. Violet later sends Titus childhood memories to preserve her history, though he deletes them. And when Violet convinces him to visit the mountains with her, one of her life goals, Titus breaks up with her, saying he was only interested in a short relationship while she wanted something eternal. 
Time passes and Titus eventually hears from Violet’s father. At Violet’s home, Titus sees her lying on a floating bed, completely pale, fully incapacitated, and covered in discs. Her father details her final, painful days and how her body failed. He then berates Titus for how badly he treated Violet and for willfully living in ignorance. Titus later visits Violet’s home a second time. Although she appears dead, her feed efficiency is at 4.6 percent and a screen shows that her heart is beating slightly. Nevertheless, Titus tells Violet a story he plans to keep telling her, he says, so she will remember herself. The story is about Violet, the end of America, and their relationship, where they learn something important about love and how to resist the feed. The book ends with a promotion on the feed for Blue-Jean Warehouse’s Final Sales Event and a recurring, fading message that “Everything must go.”"
Recommendation,"Okonkwo is a wealthy and respected warrior of the Umuofia clan, a lower Nigerian tribe that is part of a consortium of nine connected villages. He is haunted by the actions of Unoka, his cowardly and spendthrift father, who died in disrepute, leaving many village debts unsettled. In response, Okonkwo became a clansman, warrior, farmer, and family provider extraordinaire. He has a twelve-year-old son named Nwoye whom he finds lazy; Okonkwo worries that Nwoye will end up a failure like Unoka.
In a settlement with a neighboring tribe, Umuofia wins a virgin and a fifteen-year-old boy. Okonkwo takes charge of the boy, Ikemefuna, and finds an ideal son in him. Nwoye likewise forms a strong attachment to the newcomer. Despite his fondness for Ikemefuna and despite the fact that the boy begins to call him “father,” Okonkwo does not let himself show any affection for him.
During the Week of Peace, Okonkwo accuses his youngest wife, Ojiugo, of negligence. He severely beats her, breaking the peace of the sacred week. He makes some sacrifices to show his repentance, but he has shocked his community irreparably.
Ikemefuna stays with Okonkwo’s family for three years. Nwoye looks up to him as an older brother and, much to Okonkwo’s pleasure, develops a more masculine attitude. One day, the locusts come to Umuofia—they will come every year for seven years before disappearing for another generation. The village excitedly collects them because they are good to eat when cooked.
Ogbuefi Ezeudu, a respected village elder, informs Okonkwo in private that the Oracle has said that Ikemefuna must be killed. He tells Okonkwo that because Ikemefuna calls him “father,” Okonkwo should not take part in the boy’s death. Okonkwo lies to Ikemefuna, telling him that they must return him to his home village. Nwoye bursts into tears.
As he walks with the men of Umuofia, Ikemefuna thinks about seeing his mother. After several hours of walking, some of Okonkwo’s clansmen attack the boy with machetes. Ikemefuna runs to Okonkwo for help. But Okonkwo, who doesn’t wish to look weak in front of his fellow tribesmen, cuts the boy down despite the Oracle’s admonishment. When Okonkwo returns home, Nwoye deduces that his friend is dead.
Okonkwo sinks into a depression, neither able to sleep nor eat. He visits his friend Obierika and begins to feel revived a bit. Okonkwo’s daughter Ezinma falls ill, but she recovers after Okonkwo gathers leaves for her medicine.
The death of Ogbuefi Ezeudu is announced to the surrounding villages by means of the ekwe, a musical instrument. Okonkwo feels guilty because the last time Ezeudu visited him was to warn him against taking part in Ikemefuna’s death. At Ogbuefi Ezeudu’s large and elaborate funeral, the men beat drums and fire their guns. Tragedy compounds upon itself when Okonkwo’s gun explodes and kills Ogbuefi Ezeudu’s sixteen-year-old son.
Because killing a clansman is a crime against the earth goddess, Okonkwo must take his family into exile for seven years in order to atone. He gathers his most valuable belongings and takes his family to his mother’s natal village, Mbanta. The men from Ogbuefi Ezeudu’s quarter burn Okonkwo’s buildings and kill his animals to cleanse the village of his sin.
Okonkwo’s kinsmen, especially his uncle, Uchendu, receive him warmly. They help him build a new compound of huts and lend him yam seeds to start a farm. Although he is bitterly disappointed at his misfortune, Okonkwo reconciles himself to life in his motherland.
During the second year of Okonkwo’s exile, Obierika brings several bags of cowries (shells used as currency) that he has made by selling Okonkwo’s yams. Obierika plans to continue to do so until Okonkwo returns to the village. Obierika also brings the bad news that Abame, another village, has been destroyed by the white man.
Soon afterward, six missionaries travel to Mbanta. Through an interpreter named Mr. Kiaga, the missionaries’ leader, Mr. Brown, speaks to the villagers. He tells them that their gods are false and that worshipping more than one God is idolatrous. But the villagers do not understand how the Holy Trinity can be accepted as one God. Although his aim is to convert the residents of Umuofia to Christianity, Mr. Brown does not allow his followers to antagonize the clan.
Mr. Brown grows ill and is soon replaced by Reverend James Smith, an intolerant and strict man. The more zealous converts are relieved to be free of Mr. Brown’s policy of restraint. One such convert, Enoch, dares to unmask an egwugwu during the annual ceremony to honor the earth deity, an act equivalent to killing an ancestral spirit. The next day, the egwugwu burn Enoch’s compound and Reverend Smith’s church to the ground.
The District Commissioner is upset by the burning of the church and requests that the leaders of Umuofia meet with him. Once they are gathered, however, the leaders are handcuffed and thrown in jail, where they suffer insults and physical abuse.
After the prisoners are released, the clansmen hold a meeting, during which five court messengers approach and order the clansmen to desist. Expecting his fellow clan members to join him in uprising, Okonkwo kills their leader with his machete. When the crowd allows the other messengers to escape, Okonkwo realizes that his clan is not willing to go to war.
When the District Commissioner arrives at Okonkwo’s compound, he finds that Okonkwo has hanged himself. Obierika and his friends lead the commissioner to the body. Obierika explains that suicide is a grave sin; thus, according to custom, none of Okonkwo’s clansmen may touch his body. The commissioner, who is writing a book about Africa, believes that the story of Okonkwo’s rebellion and death will make for an interesting paragraph or two. He has already chosen the book’s title: The Pacification of the Primitive Tribes of the Lower Niger."
Lie,"Simon Kelleher has a particular talent for uncovering the secrets of his fellow students at Bayview High School. He uses a gossip app he created called About That to spread these secrets as well as rumors and nasty comments about his peers.
One September afternoon, Simon and four other seniors find themselves in detention. Addy Prentiss, Bronwyn Rojas, and Cooper Clay are rarely mentioned on Simon’s app, but Nate Macauley, who is often in trouble and who sleeps with a lot of girls, appears frequently. A teacher, Mr. Avery, has given all five students detention for having their cell phones in class—phones which they all claim were planted. When a car crash occurs outside, Mr. Avery leaves to go make sure no one was hurt. Moments later, Simon takes a drink of water and collapses almost instantly. After a frantic search for an EpiPen comes up empty, Simon is taken away by paramedics and soon is later pronounced dead.
Addy and her boyfriend, Jake, are friends with Cooper and his girlfriend, Keely. Bronwyn, whom Nate has known since kindergarten, has been an overachiever ever since her younger sister, Maeve, survived leukemia. Speculation about Simon’s death quickly takes over Bayview High School as the police seem to be treating it as not having been an accident. The four students who were in detention with Simon are approached by the police when someone makes an online post claiming to be Simon’s murderer. The police also discover unpublished About That content queued up by Simon implying that Addy, Bronwyn, Cooper, and Nate each has a secret to hide. The police believe that each benefited from Simon’s death because that prevented these rumors from being posted.
Jake and Addy have been together since their freshman year, but Addy fears what will happen when Jake finds out that she had sex with someone else last year. That is her secret.
Although generally a top student, Bronwyn once stole chemistry exam answers off her teacher’s computer. She fears what will happen if this becomes public knowledge. The police also confront Bronwyn with an old About That post. Simon wrote a humiliating account of her sister Maeve’s first high school party and made light of her bout with cancer, which obviously angered Bronwyn.
Cooper is a pitcher with a bright future playing baseball, has a popular girlfriend, and is widely liked. The rumor Simon had queued up, that Cooper used steroids, is untrue. However, the police discover a file Simon had encrypted, containing another rumor about Cooper, and this one actually is true. Despite protests from Cooper’s lawyer, Cooper is pressured into revealing his secret to his family: he is gay, and he has been cheating on Keely with a guy named Kris. 
As the only member of the Bayview Four with a criminal record, Nate seems to be the leading suspect in Simon’s murder. Nate has always had feelings for Bronwyn, feelings that seem to be mutual as they grow closer during the investigation into Simon’s death. However, Nate worries that Bronwyn just sees him as a project she can manage. Nate was known to have used and sold drugs in the past, and Simon’s unpublished post alleges that he is doing so again—which is, in fact, true. But since Simon’s death and the events following it, Nate has walked away from selling and taking drugs—at least partly because he knows that Bronwyn deserves someone whose life is less complicated. 
When the police seem focused only on pinning Simon’s death on one or more of the “Bayview Four,” Maeve begins an investigation of Simon on her own, and shares what she finds with her sister Bronwyn. Maeve is able to access Simon’s About That admin page and she also looks into Simon’s past. Maeve discovers some unsettling information about Simon, including some terrible comments he wrote and posted after a nearby school shooting. In spite of their lawyers and parents discouraging the Bayview Four from speaking with each other, they agree to work together as the investigation intensifies. Aided by Ashton and Maeve, they continue to dig into Simon’s past. 
After Addy reaches out to Janae, Simon’s only friend, Janae starts spending time with Addy and Bronwyn. Addy finally confesses to Jake that she had cheated on him, and she is bullied and ostracized at school by her former friends—who, it turns out, were just Jake’s friends and not hers. However, she finds new freedom once she is outside Jake’s influence. After Cooper tells his parents about Kris, he confides in Addy, as well. Nate comes to Cooper’s defense when the school learns that Cooper is gay. By now, everyone’s secret is out, and each of the four is increasingly intent on finding Simon’s real killer so they can move forward with their lives.
For Addy and Cooper, the urgency briefly lessens when Nate is arrested. Acting on an anonymous tip, the police have discovered incriminating items in Nate’s possession, including Simon’s EpiPen and water bottle. Nate’s fingerprints don’t appear on any of the items, however. Bronwyn enlists Addy and Cooper to help clear Nate, as well as a pro bono lawyer named Eli Kleinfelter. Since she is deeply involved in the investigation, Bronwyn has been warned not to contact Eli, who has officially taken on Nate’s case, so she feeds Eli information through Ashton. When the Bayview Four discover that Simon hired someone to stage the car crash, they conclude that Simon orchestrated his own death. However, the group don’t believe that Simon acted alone. Simon must have had an accomplice: whoever has been posting anonymously about the case.
Jake soon becomes their prime suspect, which saddens Addy. Addy goes to Janae’s home, and Janae confirms that Simon did indeed orchestrate his own death. He used his knowledge about Addy’s infidelity to persuade Jake to help him, including planting the fake cell phones that led the group being assigned to detention. After Simon’s death, Jake wrote the anonymous posts and forced Janae to plant evidence that would implicate his ex-girlfriend Addy—or so Jake thought. In the end, Janae couldn’t bring herself frame Addy because Addy had been so kind to her after Simon’s death, so she framed Nate instead. The framing of Nate was a deception that the police were all too willing to accept as fact.
Confronted by Jake in her home, Janae tries to stand up to him and get him to admit to his role in the framing plot while Addy hides and records their conversation on her phone. But when Addy’s phone rings at this inopportune moment, she is chased from the house by Jake. Addy falls, hitting her head on a rock, and Jake begins to throttle her. Cooper suddenly appears just in time to pull Jake off Addy and save her life. The authorities are called, and Jake is taken into custody.
Addy recovers from Jake’s attack, Nate is released from jail, and the Bayview Four, now exonerated, move forward with their lives. Nate decides that Bronwyn is better off without him, but she Bronwyn is hurt by his coldness toward her. A few months later, members of the group gather to watch Bronwyn perform in a recital. Afterward, Nate surprises Bronwyn with an apology. So many good things in Nate’s life have been ruined, but he doesn’t want to lose Bronwyn. They agree to resume their relationship."
Nature,"Nineteen-year-old Roy Hobbs, a country bumpkin with a great pitching arm, is on his way to Chicago to try out for the Chicago Cubs. He is on the train with the Cubs' scout, Sam Simpson. While on the train, Roy meets a woman named Harriet Bird, for whom he immediately develops a crush. He also meets a sports journalist, Max Mercy, who is on the train with a famous baseball hitter, the Whammer.
The train stops at a carnival, and Roy and the Whammer both show off their skills at games. Sam bets that Roy can strike out the Whammer, and Roy does. In the process, however, Roy accidentally hurts Sam, who dies later that day from the injury. When they reach Chicago, Harriet invites Roy to her room. After Roy tells her he will be ""the greatest in the game,"" she shoots him.
Fifteen years later, Pop Fisher, the manager of the New York Knights, discovers he has a new ""rookie"" for his team—a thirty-four-year-old man named Roy Hobbs, whom the team's owner, the stingy Judge Banner, has signed for a paltry $3,000. The Knights are doing very poorly; even their playing field is dried up from a long drought.
Pop is skeptical of Roy. When Roy refuses to join the hypnotist sessions to which Pop subjects the team, Pop benches Roy for three weeks. In the meantime, Roy falls for Pop's niece, Memo Paris, but she is already the girlfriend of the team's star player, Bump Baily. Roy also meets Max Mercy, the sports journalist, again, but Mercy does not recognize him.
Finally, Pop sends Roy into a game one day to pinch-hit. Roy smashes the cover off the ball on his first at-bat, and at the same time a downpour begins that lasts for three days. Soon, the field is green again and Roy is hitting regularly, wowing everyone with his amazing talent. Bump Baily takes offense at Roy's rise, and he tries so hard to outdo Roy that he accidentally cracks his skull against the wall. Bump later dies from his injuries; ultimately, Roy tries to move in on Memo. She is cold and indifferent to him, but he cannot stop thinking about her.
When the Knights begin to rise in the standings due to Roy's amazing performance, Roy asks the Judge for a raise, but the Judge refuses. Roy runs into Max Mercy, who takes him out to a club owned by Gus Sands, the ""Supreme Bookie""—a millionaire tycoon of the betting circuit. Gus and Memo are sitting together when Roy and Max arrive. Gus wins some significant money from Roy, and Roy pays him back in the form of parlor tricks.
A few weeks later, the fans hold ""Roy's Day,"" in which they shower him with cheers and gifts after hearing how poorly the Judge has been treating him. Roy even gets a car and takes Memo on a date. The date goes poorly, however, and Roy ends up crashing the car into a ditch. Neither of them are injured, but it is clear that Memo is not very interested in Roy. Nevertheless, he cannot stop obsessing over her.
Shortly thereafter, Roy enters a slump, unable to get a single hit. He tries everything he can to end the slump, from superstitious tricks to meeting a fortuneteller. Pop tells Roy to stop using his bat, Wonderboy, and to try a different one, but Roy refuses. Just before a game in Chicago, a fan begs Roy to hit a home run; the fan told his son, who is fighting for his life in the hospital, that Roy said he would. Pop lets Roy bat, and Roy immediately goes through two strikes. Then Roy notices a woman standing up in the crowd for him. The woman gives him a kind of strength, and he nails a home run on the next hit.
Roy decides to meet the woman. Her name is Iris Lemon. The two go on a date, and Iris seems to understand Roy very well. Unfortunately, Roy does not seem to understand Iris or what she is trying to tell him. They go swimming and then make love, but Roy is shocked to discover that Iris, at age thirty-three, is already a grandmother. He soon tries to forget about her, focusing once more on Memo, who has ignored him for weeks.
Suddenly, as Roy is hitting well again, Memo begins to pay attention to him, making him hunger for her even more. But he also hungers for vast amounts of food, and he begins to eat and eat. Memo holds a great banquet for all the players before an important three-game series, promising Roy sex after the banquet. But when Roy goes to her, he gets an enormous stomachache and winds up in the hospital.
Meanwhile, the Knights lose their next three games, tying the Pirates for first place. Memo visits Roy at the hospital. He asks her to marry him, but she tells him she cannot do so unless he is sufficiently rich and can ""take care of her."" Shortly thereafter, Judge Banner visits Roy and offers him $35,000 to throw the next game, which will decide who wins the pennant. Roy reluctantly agrees, and the next day at the game, he does not play his best.
However, Roy slowly begins to change his mind. At one at-bat, he is viciously booed by a dwarf named Otto P. Zipp. Roy tries to foul off several pitches toward the dwarf; one finally hits the dwarf, but caroms off the dwarf's skull and hits a woman that had stood up in the stands—Iris Lemon. Iris tells Roy that she is pregnant with his child, and that he must win the game for both the child and the two of them. Roy agrees and goes back to the plate ready to crack one. But as he does so, his bat, Wonderboy, splits in half.
In his next at-bat, Roy is once again ready to conquer, though not with Wonderboy. The opposing team's pitcher is so terrified of Roy that he faints dead away. The other team sends out a young phenom pitcher instead. Roy suddenly finds himself in the place of the Whammer, striking out against a young, fantastic pitcher. Distraught after the game, Roy visits the Judge and beats him up, along with Gus Sands. Roy throws the Judge's money at him and calls Memo a whore. Memo tells him that she has hated him ever since he ""murdered Bump."" Roy leaves and sees a newspaper: Max Mercy has discovered Roy's sellout. A boy asks Roy, ""Say it ain't so, Roy."" Roy can only weep in response."
Businesses,"The protagonist, who is named Tim O’Brien, begins by describing an event that occurred in the middle of his Vietnam experience. “The Things They Carried” catalogs the variety of things his fellow soldiers in the Alpha Company brought on their missions. Several of these things are intangible, including guilt and fear, while others are specific physical objects, including matches, morphine, M-16 rifles, and M&M’s candy.
Throughout the collection, the same characters reappear in various stories. The first member of the Alpha Company to die is Ted Lavender, a “grunt,” or low-ranking soldier, who deals with his anxiety about the war by taking tranquilizers and smoking marijuana. Lavender is shot in the head on his way back from going to the bathroom, and his superior, Lieutenant Jimmy Cross, blames himself for the tragedy. When Lavender is shot, Cross is distracting himself with thoughts of Martha, a college crush. It is revealed in “Love” that Cross’s feelings for Martha, whom he dated once before leaving for Vietnam, were never reciprocated, and that even twenty years after the war, his guilt over Lavender’s death remains.
In “On the Rainy River,” the narrator, O’Brien, explains the series of events that led him to Vietnam in the first place. He receives his draft notice in June of 1968, and his feelings of confusion drive him north to the Canadian border, which he contemplates crossing so that he will not be forced to fight in a war in which he doesn’t believe. Sitting in a rowboat with the proprietor of the Tip Top Lodge, where he stays, O’Brien decides that his guilt about avoiding the war and fear of disappointing his family are more important than his political convictions. He soon leaves, going first back home to Worthington, Minnesota and later to Vietnam.
In addition to Ted Lavender, a few other members of the Alpha Company are killed during their mission overseas, including Curt Lemon, who is killed when he steps on a rigged mortar round. Though O’Brien is not close to Lemon, in “The Dentist,” he tells a story of how Lemon, who faints before a routine checkup with an army-issued dentist, tries to save face by insisting that a perfectly good tooth be pulled. Lee Strunk, another member of the company, dies from injuries he sustains by stepping on a landmine. In “Friends,” O’Brien remembers that before Strunk was fatally hurt, Strunk and Dave Jensen had made a pact that if either man were irreparably harmed, the other man would see that he was quickly killed. However, when Strunk is actually hurt, he begs Jensen to spare him, and Jensen complies. Instead of being upset by the news of his friend’s swift death en route to treatment, Jensen is relieved.
The death that receives the most attention in The Things They Carried is that of Kiowa, a much-loved member of the Alpha Company and one of O’Brien’s closest friends. In “Speaking of Courage,” the story of Kiowa’s death is relayed in retrospect through the memory of Norman Bowker, years after the war. As Bowker drives around a lake in his Iowa hometown, he thinks that he failed to save Kiowa, who was killed when a mortar round hit and caused him to sink headfirst into a marshy field. O’Brien realizes that he has dealt with his guilt over Kiowa’s death differently than Norman Bowker in “Notes.” Just before the end of the war, O’Brien receives a long letter from Bowker that says he hasn’t found a way to make life meaningful after the war. O’Brien resolves to tell Bowker’s story, and the story of Kiowa’s death, in order to negotiate his own feelings of guilt and hollowness.
Like “Love” and “Notes,” several of O’Brien’s stories are told from a perspective twenty years after the Vietnam War, when he is a forty-three-year-old writer living in Massachusetts. Exposure to the guilt of old friends like Jimmy Cross and Norman Bowker prompts him to write stories in order to understand what they were going through. But two stories, “The Man I Killed” and “Ambush,” are written so that O’Brien can confront his own guilt over killing a man with a grenade outside the village of My Khe. In “The Man I Killed,” O’Brien imagines the life of his victim, from his childhood to the way things would have turned out for him had O’Brien not spotted him on a path and thrown a grenade at his feet. In “Ambush,” O’Brien imagines how he might relay the story of the man he killed to his nine-year-old daughter, Kathleen. In this second story, O’Brien provides more details of the actual killing—including the sound of the grenade and his own feelings—and explains that even well after the fact, he hasn’t finished sorting out the experience.
In the last story, “The Lives of the Dead,” O’Brien gives another twist to his contention that stories have the power to save people. In the stories of Curt Lemon and Kiowa, O’Brien explains that his imagination allowed him to grapple successfully with his guilt and confusion over the death of his fourth-grade first love, Linda."
Us,"The novel begins where It Ends with Us left off, after the novel’s protagonists Lily Kincaid and Atlas Corrigan run into each other on the street, and Lily tells Atlas she and Ryle are now divorced. Told in chapters that alternate between Atlas’s and Lily’s perspectives, the novel begins with Atlas nervously hoping Lily will text him soon like she said she would. This hope keeps him uplifted as he handles the reality that someone broke into his restaurant, Bib’s, and vandalized it with a misspelled profanity. Meanwhile, Lily is incredibly busy at Lily Bloom’s, her flower shop, and is confused about what to do about Atlas, knowing a romance with Atlas will infuriate her jealous and abusive ex-husband, Ryle, with whom she shares jointed custody of their infant daughter Emerson.   
Atlas visits the flower shop wanting to talk to Lily and ask her if they can speak on the phone that evening. Ryle comes in unexpectedly, and a panicked Lily hides Atlas in the office supply closet. Lily and Atlas do talk on FaceTime that evening, catching up on each other’s lives, flirting, and testing the waters of their relationship. Hearing that Ryle responded in rage after reading Lily’s teenage journals about Atlas, Atlas asks Lily to read to him from the journals. 
On their first date, Lily gifts Atlas one of her journals. Exhausted after staying up all night with a sick Emerson, Lily falls asleep during the ride to the restaurant. Atlas lets Lily sleep, content to read her journal, reliving their first kiss. Inspired, Atlas writes Lily a letter about his life before her. Atlas recounts how his mother rejected and abused him as a teenager, choosing herself and her abusive husband Tim over Atlas. He says that Lily changed his life and taught him what love was. When Lily wakes up, she reads Atlas’s letter and is moved by it. They want to kiss goodnight but decide to continue taking it slow. 
After his date with Lily, Atlas encounters his mother, Sutton, who is at his restaurant to ask Atlas if he knows where his twelve-year-old brother Josh is. Atlas tells Sutton he didn’t know Josh existed until their conversation. Atlas realizes that Josh is likely the vandal targeting his restaurants. As Atlas deals with Sutton, Lily returns from their date to an angry Ryle, who has just watched Finding Nemo for the first time. Ryle is furious that his daughter’s middle name, Dory, is associated with Atlas, as he is aware that Lily and Atlas often talked about Dory as teenagers. Ryle’s rage-fueled confrontation shakes Lily, and after getting away from Atlas, she is comforted when Marshall, Ryle’s best friend and brother-in-law, tells her she was right to leave Ryle. After their respective rough nights, Atlas drives to Lily’s house to give her a hug. Afterward, Atlas stakes out Bib’s and reads Lily’s journal entry about the first time he and Lily made love, after which Lily’s father almost beat him to death. Atlas catches Josh attempting to vandalize his restaurant. He convinces Josh to come stay with him. Atlas doesn’t want Josh to return to live with Sutton, who he feels is still abusive and only cares about herself. The following day, Sutton demands that Atlas bring Josh to her, and when he does, Atlas sees Sutton strike Josh. He immediately gets Josh back in the car and then takes him to the hospital, vowing to fight for custody.  
Lily invites Atlas to be her date for her coworker Lucy’s wedding. While Lily is getting ready, Atlas sees Lily’s collarbone, the spot where Ryle once bit Lily, and notices the heart tattoo that Lily got as a teenager. Atlas feels upset upon realizing Ryle bit Lily’s collarbone out of jealousy. Lily realizes Atlas’s anger is protective, and she isn’t afraid of him. Atlas and Lily kiss. After making a brief appearance at Lucy’s wedding, they return to Lily’s and make love for the first time since they were teenagers. Afterward, they talk about Atlas fighting for custody of Josh and about the aftermath of Lily’s father’s violent outburst the last time they made love. Atlas returns home to Josh.  
The next morning, Lily is woken to the sound of Ryle pounding her door. Ryle notices evidence of the previous evening and quickly figures out that Lily was with Atlas. He flies into a rage, pinning her to the wall by her throat. Lily, afraid that he’s going to come for Emerson, tells her mother, who watched Emerson the previous night, to take her to a park. Unsure where to go after she picks Emerson up, Lily takes Emerson to Atlas’s and hides out. Josh is working on a homework assignment about his family tree that he struggles to finish because he doesn’t know his family. Atlas thinks if he and Lily were together, he’d raise Emerson as his own daughter. 
Lily wakes up the next morning to a series of angry, threatening texts from Ryle, who also comes to the flower shop to try to make nice after his drunken, menacing texts. Lily tells Ryle she’s sent the messages to her lawyer. Ryle leaves in a rage, and Lily warns Atlas that Ryle may be coming for him, and before Atlas hangs up, Ryle is there. Ryle punches Atlas, blaming him for his problems with Lily. Atlas nonconfrontationally points out to Ryle that his marriage ended because of his temper. Atlas tries to convince Ryle that they need to be a team, since Emerson is impacted by all of their behavior. Ryle leaves, somewhat less angry. Atlas tells Lily about the conversation, and she is pleased that he diffused the situation with words and not violence. 
Atlas and Lily are having a peaceful morning together when Sutton arrives at Atlas’s, demanding Josh back. Josh returns from Theo’s and is afraid of his mother. He insists he wants to live with his father, Tim. Sutton leaves and Lily connects with Josh while Atlas calms down. Atlas takes Josh to see his father in Vermont. Josh realizes he wants to stay with Atlas and says his family tree can be a seedling with two branches—one for him and one for Atlas. Later, Allysa, Marshall, and Lily confront Ryle, telling him that he needs to go to anger management and that he’ll only have supervised visits with Emerson and Rylee until further notice. Ryle is upset but agrees to get help. Meanwhile, Atlas tells Sutton that he wants custody of Josh but encourages her to meet them once a week for dinner, so she can still have a relationship with both her sons. Six months after they began dating, Atlas and Lily move in together. A few years later, they get married. In his vows, Atlas says that no matter what happens, he’s grateful to have gotten to love Lily and even to have her break his heart. He is hopeful for the future."
Officered,"Offred is a Handmaid in the Republic of Gilead, a totalitarian and theocratic state that has replaced the United States of America. Because of dangerously low reproduction rates, Handmaids are assigned to bear children for elite couples that have trouble conceiving. Offred serves the Commander and his wife, Serena Joy, a former gospel singer and advocate for “traditional values.” Offred is not the narrator’s real name—Handmaid names consist of the word “of” followed by the name of the Handmaid’s Commander. Every month, when Offred is at the right point in her menstrual cycle, she must have ritualized sex with the Commander while Serena sits behind her, holding her hands. Offred’s freedom, like the freedom of all women, is completely restricted. She can leave the house only on shopping trips, the door to her room cannot be completely shut, and the Eyes, Gilead’s secret police force, watch her every public move.
As Offred tells the story of her daily life, she frequently slips into flashbacks, from which the reader can reconstruct the events leading up to the beginning of the novel. In the old world, before Gilead, Offred had an affair with Luke, a married man. Luke divorced his wife and married Offred, and they had a child together. Offred’s mother was a single mother and feminist activist. Offred’s best friend, Moira, was fiercely independent. The architects of Gilead began their rise to power in an age of readily available pornography, prostitution, and violence against women—when pollution and chemical spills led to declining fertility rates. Using the military, they assassinated the president and members of Congress and launched a coup, claiming that they were taking power temporarily. They cracked down on women’s rights, forbidding women to hold property or jobs. Offred and Luke took their daughter and attempted to flee across the border into Canada, but they were caught and separated from one another, and Offred has seen neither her husband nor her daughter since.
After her capture, Offred’s marriage was voided (because Luke had been divorced), and she was sent to the Rachel and Leah Re-education Center, called the Red Center by its inhabitants. At the center, women were indoctrinated into Gilead’s ideology in preparation for becoming Handmaids. Aunt Lydia supervised the women, giving speeches extolling Gilead’s beliefs that women should be subservient to men and solely concerned with bearing children. Aunt Lydia also argued that such a social order ultimately offers women more respect and safety than the old, pre-Gilead society offered them. Moira is brought to the Red Center, but she escapes, and Offred does not know what becomes of her.
Once Offred is assigned to the Commander’s house, her life settles into a restrictive routine. She takes shopping trips with Ofglen, another Handmaid, and they visit the Wall outside what used to be Harvard University, where the bodies of rebels hang. She must visit the doctor frequently to be checked for disease and other complications, and she must endure the “Ceremony,” in which the Commander reads to the household from the Bible, then goes to the bedroom, where Serena and Offred wait for him, and has sex with Offred.
The first break from her routine occurs when she visits the doctor and he offers to have sex with her to get her pregnant, suggesting that her Commander is probably infertile. She refuses. The doctor makes her uneasy, but his proposition is too risky—she could be sent away if caught. After a Ceremony, the Commander sends his gardener and chauffeur, Nick, to ask Offred to come see him in his study the following night. She begins visiting him regularly. They play Scrabble (which is forbidden, since women are not allowed to read), and he lets her look at old magazines like Vogue. At the end of these secret meetings, he asks her to kiss him.
During one of their shopping trips, Ofglen reveals to Offred that she is a member of “Mayday,” an underground organization dedicated to overthrowing Gilead. Meanwhile, Offred begins to find that the Ceremony feels different and less impersonal now that she knows the Commander. Their nighttime conversations begin to touch on the new order that the Commander and his fellow leaders have created in Gilead. When Offred admits how unhappy she is, the Commander remarks, “[Y]ou can’t make an omelette without breaking eggs.”
After some time has gone by without Offred becoming pregnant, Serena suggests that Offred have sex with Nick secretly and pass the child off as the Commander’s. Serena promises to bring Offred a picture of her daughter if she sleeps with Nick, and Offred realizes with horror that Serena has always known where her daughter was. The same night that Offred is to sleep with Nick, the Commander secretly takes her out to a club called Jezebel’s, where the Commanders mingle with prostitutes. Offred sees Moira working there. The two women meet in a bathroom, and Offred learns that Moira was captured just before she crossed the border. She chose life in Jezebel’s over being sent to the Colonies, where most political prisoners and others who pose a threat to Gilead are sent. After that night at Jezebel’s, Offred says, she never sees Moira again. The Commander takes Offred upstairs after a few hours, and they have sex in what used to be a hotel room. She tries to feign passion.
Soon after Offred returns from Jezebel’s, late at night, Serena arrives and tells Offred to go to Nick’s room. Offred and Nick have sex. Soon they begin to sleep together frequently, without anyone’s knowledge. Offred becomes caught up in the affair and ignores Ofglen’s requests that she gather information from the Commander for Mayday. One day, all the Handmaids take part in a group execution of a supposed rapist, supervised by Aunt Lydia. Ofglen strikes the first blow. Later, she tells Offred that the so-called rapist was a member of Mayday and that she hit him to put him out of his misery.
Shortly thereafter, Offred goes out shopping, and a new Ofglen meets her. This new woman is not part of Mayday, and she tells Offred that the old Ofglen hanged herself when she saw the secret police coming for her. At home, Serena has found out about Offred’s trip to Jezebel’s, and she sends her to her room, promising punishment. Offred waits there, and she sees a black van from the Eyes approach. Then Nick comes in and tells her that the Eyes are really Mayday members who have come to save her. Offred leaves with them, over the Commander’s futile objections, on her way either to prison or to freedom—she does not know which.
The novel closes with an epilogue from 2195, after Gilead has fallen, written in the form of a lecture given by Professor Pieixoto. He explains the formation and customs of Gilead in objective, analytical language. He discusses the significance of Offred’s story, which has been found on cassette tapes in Bangor, Maine. Pieixoto suggests that Nick arranged Offred’s escape but that her fate after that is unknown. She could have escaped to Canada or England, or she could have been recaptured."
Intervals,"In 1993, when Sara Saedi is almost thirteen, her older sister Samira reveals their family secret: the Saedis are illegal aliens, or undocumented immigrants. Although they have lived in the Bay Area near San Francisco, for over ten years and Sara knows no other life, the family can be deported at any time. Now, Sara’s ordinary teenage anxieties are augmented by the fear that she will be sent back to Iran. Americanized: Rebel Without a Green Card is an autobiographical account of Saedi growing up during the years following her sister’s revelation to her about their undocumented status.
When Sara’s parents, Ali and Shohreh Saedi, were growing up in Iran, Iran was a relatively open and secular society. In the early 1950s, Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh nationalized the oil industry and promoted democracy. A military coup deposed Mossadegh, however, and established a monarchy under Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. The Shah was overthrown in 1979, only to be replaced by Islamic rule under the Ayatollah Khomeini. Ali and Shohreh entered an arranged marriage in 1974. They lived in Louisiana until Ali graduated from Louisiana State University and return to Iran in 1976. Their daughter, Samira, was born the next year. In 1980, Sara was born, and war broke out between Iran and Iraq. In 1982, the Saedi family used tourist visas to get out of Iran. They arrived in San Jose, California, where Shohreh’s family had already settled.
Samira and Sara grow up in America and act like other American kids. Sara learns English from watching television and becomes obsessed with movie and TV stars, especially Winona Ryder and Ethan Hawke. Samira listens to grunge music. During her childhood, Sara fights with Samira constantly. But when Sara enters the high school where Samira is a senior, she becomes the little sister of the coolest girl in the school. Samira and her friends are glamorous celebrities to Sara. Their younger brother Kia, who is eight years younger than Sara, looks up to Sara in the same way. Just as Sara has kept Samira’s secrets from their parents, Kia keeps Sara’s secrets, except for when he ruins her life by revealing her hidden passion for schoolmate Evan Parker (a transgression for which Sara eventually forgives Kia). Sara spends her high school years obsessing over boys and hating herself for having severe acne and a Persian nose.
Ali and Shohreh work hard to give their children a better life and encourage their children to follow their dreams. However, their immigration status affects many aspects of the family’s life. Ali can’t work as an engineer because he’s undocumented, so he operates his own small business instead. Mortgages are difficult to obtain, and student loans are out of the question. The Saedis endure years of lost paperwork, legal delays, and bureaucratic frustration in order to obtain work permits and Social Security cards, then green cards, and, finally, citizenship. The fear of being deported permeates Sara’s adolescent existence. The great secret of her family’s undocumented status creates an invisible barrier between Sara and her American friends and classmates, no matter how much she tries to be like them.
The Saedis’ secrets are safe within the large circle of Sara’s extended family, consisting mostly of Shohreh’s relatives. Dayee Mehrdad, Shohreh’s successful older brother, heads this extensive Sanjideh clan. He encourages Sara, her nineteen first cousins, and their parents to gather at his large house and to support each other. Sara comes to appreciate her large family network and to recognize it as an advantage of Persian culture. She gets to know her paternal grandmother when Mamani comes from Iraq for long visits. Sara’s maternal grandmother, Mansoureh Naficy, or Maman Soury, lives with Sara’s family at the end of her life. Both grandmothers drive Sara crazy with their inability to speak English and their traditional ideas, but their complicated, dramatic, and romantic life stories fascinate her. Sara shares her parents’ sorrow at their mothers’ deaths.
During her junior year in high school, Sara obsesses over Evan Parker and finally works up the courage to invite him to her junior prom. He turns her down on because of the expense, crushing her romantic hopes. Sara desperately wants boys to like her, and she despises herself because they think of her as only a friend. In her senior year, she finally gets a boyfriend, a death metal nerd nicknamed Slash, so she has a date for her senior prom. Eventually, after her freshman year in college, Sara and Slash have sex, after which Sara concludes that sex is overrated. She and Slash break up two months later.
A crisis occurs during Sara’s senior year of high school: Unable to pay both their mortgage and Samira’s college tuition, Ali and Shohreh have to sell their house and move to a smaller place. The move devastates Sara, who vows that she will return and buy the house someday. Meanwhile, the Saedis’ immigration struggles reach a crisis point: They’ve been on hold so long that Samira might age out of the system. A last-minute rescue from an immigration lawyer gets Samira a green card, just days before her twenty-first birthday. Shohreh gets her green card at the same time. But Sara and Ali must wait two more years, followed by another five-year wait before they qualify for citizenship. Sara finally becomes a citizen in 2005. Sara, now officially Americanized, has even started using a fork instead of a spoon to eat her rice. She concludes that she’s a “spork,” both Iranian and American, and proud to be both.
Sara varies her memoir by adding family photos and excerpts from her diary from her teen years. At intervals, she also answers FAQs about Iranians and their culture. In the last sections of the memoir, Sara addresses readers who are undocumented immigrants. She compares the immigration policies of George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and Donald Trump and worries about anti-Muslim prejudices. She empathizes with the fears of these Americans still living in the shadows, reminds them of their rights, and assures them that millions of people support their dreams. Sara imagines herself if had she stayed in Iran. She writes a letter to that Sara, expressing the belief that they would have much in common despite all their differences."
Extraneous,"The Awakening opens in the late 1800s in Grand Isle, a summer holiday resort popular with the wealthy inhabitants of nearby New Orleans. Edna Pontellier is vacationing with her husband, Léonce, and their two sons at the cottages of Madame Lebrun, which house affluent Creoles from the French Quarter. Léonce is kind and loving but preoccupied with his work. His frequent business-related absences mar his domestic life with Edna. Consequently, Edna spends most of her time with her friend Adèle Ratignolle, a married Creole who epitomizes womanly elegance and charm. Through her relationship with Adèle, Edna learns a great deal about freedom of expression. Because Creole women were expected and assumed to be chaste, they could behave in a forthright and unreserved manner. Exposure to such openness liberates Edna from her previously prudish behavior and repressed emotions and desires.
Edna’s relationship with Adèle begins Edna’s process of “awakening” and self-discovery, which constitutes the focus of the book. The process accelerates as Edna comes to know Robert Lebrun, the elder, single son of Madame Lebrun. Robert is known among the Grand Isle vacationers as a man who chooses one woman each year—often a married woman—to whom he then plays “attendant” all summer long. This summer, he devotes himself to Edna, and the two spend their days together lounging and talking by the shore. Adèle Ratignolle often accompanies them.
At first, the relationship between Robert and Edna is innocent. They mostly bathe in the sea or engage in idle talk. As the summer progresses, however, Edna and Robert grow closer, and Robert’s affections and attention inspire in Edna several internal revelations. She feels more alive than ever before, and she starts to paint again as she did in her youth. She also learns to swim and becomes aware of her independence and sexuality. Edna and Robert never openly discuss their love for one another, but the time they spend alone together kindles memories in Edna of the dreams and desires of her youth. She becomes inexplicably depressed at night with her husband and profoundly joyful during her moments of freedom, whether alone or with Robert. Recognizing how intense the relationship between him and Edna has become, Robert honorably removes himself from Grand Isle to avoid consummating his forbidden love. Edna returns to New Orleans a changed woman.
Back in New Orleans, Edna actively pursues her painting and ignores all of her social responsibilities. Worried about the changing attitude and increasing disobedience of his wife, Léonce seeks the guidance of the family physician, Doctor Mandelet. A wise and enlightened man, Doctor Mandelet suspects that Edna’s transformation is the result of an affair, but he hides his suspicions from Léonce. Instead, Doctor Mandelet suggests that Léonce let Edna’s defiance run its course, since attempts to control her would only fuel her rebellion. Léonce heeds the doctor’s advice, allowing Edna to remain home alone while he is away on business. With her husband gone and her children away as well, Edna wholly rejects her former lifestyle. She moves into a home of her own and declares herself independent—the possession of no one. Her love for Robert still intense, Edna pursues an affair with the town seducer, Alcée Arobin, who is able to satisfy her sexual needs. Never emotionally attached to Arobin, Edna maintains control throughout their affair, satisfying her animalistic urges but retaining her freedom from male domination.
At this point, the self-sufficient and unconventional old pianist Mademoiselle Reisz adopts Edna as a sort of protégé, warning Edna of the sacrifices required of an artist. Edna is moved by Mademoiselle Reisz’s piano playing and visits her often. She is also eager to read the letters from abroad that Robert sends the woman. A woman who devotes her life entirely to her art, Mademoiselle serves as an inspiration and model to Edna, who continues her process of awakening and independence. Mademoiselle Reisz is the only person who knows of Robert and Edna’s secret love for one another and she encourages Edna to admit to, and act upon, her feelings.
Unable to stay away, Robert returns to New Orleans, finally expressing openly his feelings for Edna. He admits his love but reminds her that they cannot possibly be together, since she is the wife of another man. Edna explains to him her newly established independence, denying the rights of her husband over her and explaining how she and Robert can live together happily, ignoring everything extraneous to their relationship. But despite his love for Edna, Robert feels unable to enter into the adulterous affair.
When Adèle undergoes a difficult and dangerous childbirth, Edna leaves Robert’s arms to go to her friend. She pleads with him to wait for her return. From the time she spends with Edna, Adèle senses that Edna is becoming increasingly distant, and she understands that Edna’s relationship with Robert has intensified. She reminds Edna to think of her children and advocates the socially acceptable lifestyle Edna abandoned so long ago. Doctor Mandelet, while walking Edna home from Adèle’s, urges her to come see him because he is worried about the outcome of her passionate but confused actions. Already reeling under the weight of Adèle’s admonition, Edna begins to perceive herself as having acted selfishly.
Edna returns to her house to find Robert gone, a note of farewell left in his place. Robert’s inability to escape the ties of society now prompts Edna’s most devastating awakening. Haunted by thoughts of her children and realizing that she would have eventually found even Robert unable to fulfill her desires and dreams, Edna feels an overwhelming sense of solitude. Alone in a world in which she has found no feeling of belonging, she can find only one answer to the inescapable and heartbreaking limitations of society. She returns to Grand Isle, the site of her first moments of emotional, sexual, and intellectual awareness, and, in a final escape, gives herself to the sea. As she swims through the soft, embracing water, she thinks about her freedom from her husband and children, as well as Robert’s failure to understand her, Doctor Mandelet’s words of wisdom, and Mademoiselle Reisz’s courage. The text leaves open the question of whether the suicide constitutes a cowardly surrender or a liberating triumph."
Begun,"Guy Montag is a fireman who burns books in a futuristic American city. In Montag’s world, firemen start fires rather than putting them out. The people in this society do not read books, enjoy nature, spend time by themselves, think independently, or have meaningful conversations. Instead, they drive very fast, watch excessive amounts of television on wall-size sets, and listen to the radio on “Seashell Radio” sets attached to their ears.
Montag encounters a gentle seventeen-year-old girl named Clarisse McClellan, who opens his eyes to the emptiness of his life with her innocently penetrating questions and her unusual love of people and nature. Over the next few days, Montag experiences a series of disturbing events. First, his wife, Mildred, attempts suicide by swallowing a bottle of sleeping pills. Then, when he responds to an alarm that an old woman has a stash of hidden literature, the woman shocks him by choosing to be burned alive along with her books. A few days later, he hears that Clarisse has been killed by a speeding car. Montag’s dissatisfaction with his life increases, and he begins to search for a solution in a stash of books that he has stolen from his own fires and hidden inside an air-conditioning vent.
When Montag fails to show up for work, his fire chief, Beatty, pays a visit to his house. Beatty explains that it’s normal for a fireman to go through a phase of wondering what books have to offer, and he delivers a dizzying monologue explaining how books came to be banned in the first place. According to Beatty, special-interest groups and other “minorities” objected to books that offended them. Soon, books all began to look the same, as writers tried to avoid offending anybody. This was not enough, however, and society as a whole decided to simply burn books rather than permit conflicting opinions. Beatty tells Montag to take twenty-four hours or so to see if his stolen books contain anything worthwhile and then turn them in for incineration. Montag begins a long and frenzied night of reading.
Overwhelmed by the task of reading, Montag looks to his wife for help and support, but she prefers television to her husband’s company and cannot understand why he would want to take the terrible risk of reading books. He remembers that he once met a retired English professor named Faber sitting in a park, and he decides that this man might be able to help him understand what he reads. He visits Faber, who tells him that the value of books lies in the detailed awareness of life that they contain. Faber says that Montag needs not only books but also the leisure to read them and the freedom to act upon their ideas.
Faber agrees to help Montag with his reading, and they concoct a risky scheme to overthrow the status quo. Faber will contact a printer and begin reproducing books, and Montag will plant books in the homes of firemen to discredit the profession and to destroy the machinery of censorship. Faber gives him a two-way radio earpiece (the “green bullet”) so that he can hear what Montag hears and talk to him secretly.
Montag goes home, and soon two of his wife’s friends arrive to watch television. The women discuss their families and the war that is about to be declared in an extremely frivolous manner. Their superficiality angers him, and he takes out a book of poetry and reads “Dover Beach” by Matthew Arnold. Faber buzzes in his ear for him to be quiet, and Mildred tries to explain that the poetry reading is a standard way for firemen to demonstrate the uselessness of literature. The women are extremely disturbed by the poem and leave to file a complaint against Montag.
Montag goes to the fire station and hands over one of his books to Beatty. Beatty confuses Montag by barraging him with contradictory quotations from great books. Beatty exploits these contradictions to show that literature is morbid and dangerously complex, and that it deserves incineration. Suddenly, the alarm sounds, and they rush off to answer the call, only to find that the alarm is at Montag’s own house. Mildred gets into a cab with her suitcase, and Montag realizes that his own wife has betrayed him.
Beatty forces Montag to burn the house himself; when he is done, Beatty places him under arrest. When Beatty continues to berate Montag, Montag turns the flamethrower on his superior and proceeds to burn him to ashes. Montag knocks the other firemen unconscious and runs. The Mechanical Hound, a monstrous machine that Beatty has set to attack Montag, pounces and injects Montag’s leg with a large dose of anesthetic. Montag manages to destroy it with his flamethrower; then he walks off the numbness in his leg and escapes with some books that were hidden in his backyard. He hides these in another fireman’s house and calls in an alarm from a pay phone.
Montag goes to Faber’s house, where he learns that a new Hound has been put on his trail, along with several helicopters and a television crew. Faber tells Montag that he is leaving for St. Louis to see a retired printer who may be able to help them. Montag gives Faber some money and tells him how to remove Montag’s scent from his house so the Hound will not enter it. Montag then takes some of Faber’s old clothes and runs off toward the river. The whole city watches as the chase unfolds on TV, but Montag manages to escape in the river and change into Faber’s clothes to disguise his scent. He drifts downstream into the country and follows a set of abandoned railroad tracks until he finds a group of renegade intellectuals (“the Book People”), led by a man named Granger, who welcome him. They are a part of a nationwide network of book lovers who have memorized many great works of literature and philosophy. They hope that they may be of some help to mankind in the aftermath of the war that has just been declared. Montag’s role is to memorize the Book of Ecclesiastes. Enemy jets appear in the sky and completely obliterate the city with bombs. Montag and his new friends move on to search for survivors and rebuild civilization."
Prosperous,"King Hrothgar of Denmark, a descendant of the great king Shield Sheafson, enjoys a prosperous and successful reign. He builds a great mead-hall, called Heorot, where his warriors can gather to drink, receive gifts from their lord, and listen to stories sung by the scops, or bards. But the jubilant noise from Heorot angers Grendel, a horrible demon who lives in the swamplands of Hrothgar’s kingdom. Grendel terrorizes the Danes every night, killing them and defeating their efforts to fight back. The Danes suffer many years of fear, danger, and death at the hands of Grendel. Eventually, however, a young Geatish warrior named Beowulf hears of Hrothgar’s plight. Inspired by the challenge, Beowulf sails to Denmark with a small company of men, determined to defeat Grendel.
Hrothgar, who had once done a great favor for Beowulf’s father Ecgtheow, accepts Beowulf’s offer to fight Grendel and holds a feast in the hero’s honor. During the feast, an envious Dane named Unferth taunts Beowulf and accuses him of being unworthy of his reputation. Beowulf responds with a boastful description of some of his past accomplishments. His confidence cheers the Danish warriors, and the feast lasts merrily into the night. At last, however, Grendel arrives. Beowulf fights him unarmed, proving himself stronger than the demon, who is terrified. As Grendel struggles to escape, Beowulf tears the monster’s arm off. Mortally wounded, Grendel slinks back into the swamp to die. The severed arm is hung high in the mead-hall as a trophy of victory.
Overjoyed, Hrothgar showers Beowulf with gifts and treasure at a feast in his honor. Songs are sung in praise of Beowulf, and the celebration lasts late into the night. But another threat is approaching. Grendel’s mother, a swamp-hag who lives in a desolate lake, comes to Heorot seeking revenge for her son’s death. She murders Aeschere, one of Hrothgar’s most trusted advisers, before slinking away. To avenge Aeschere’s death, the company travels to the murky swamp, where Beowulf dives into the water and fights Grendel’s mother in her underwater lair. He kills her with a sword forged for a giant, then, finding Grendel’s corpse, decapitates it and brings the head as a prize to Hrothgar. The Danish countryside is now purged of its treacherous monsters.
The Danes are again overjoyed, and Beowulf’s fame spreads across the kingdom. Beowulf departs after a sorrowful goodbye to Hrothgar, who has treated him like a son. He returns to Geatland, where he and his men are reunited with their king and queen, Hygelac and Hygd, to whom Beowulf recounts his adventures in Denmark. Beowulf then hands over most of his treasure to Hygelac, who, in turn, rewards him.
In time, Hygelac is killed in a war against the Shyflings, and, after Hygelac’s son dies, Beowulf ascends to the throne of the Geats. He rules wisely for fifty years, bringing prosperity to Geatland. When Beowulf is an old man, however, a thief disturbs a barrow, or mound, where a great dragon lies guarding a horde of treasure. Enraged, the dragon emerges from the barrow and begins unleashing fiery destruction upon the Geats. Sensing his own death approaching, Beowulf goes to fight the dragon. With the aid of Wiglaf, he succeeds in killing the beast, but at a heavy cost. The dragon bites Beowulf in the neck, and its fiery venom kills him moments after their encounter. The Geats fear that their enemies will attack them now that Beowulf is dead. According to Beowulf’s wishes, they burn their departed king’s body on a huge funeral pyre and then bury him with a massive treasure in a barrow overlooking the sea."
Whatever,"Maddy, about to turn eighteen, lives in Los Angeles. She has spent her whole life indoors, due to a diagnosis of Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID). Any contact with the outside world puts her at risk of a fatal infection or allergic reaction. The house is elaborately sealed, with an airlock at the front door. Maddy is cared for by her mother, who is a doctor, and by a full-time nurse, Carla. When Maddy was just a few months old, her father and brother were killed in an accident.
A new family moves in next door. The father drinks and is violent. Maddy and the boy in the family, Olly, become friends over the Internet. They also pantomime conversations through their bedroom windows. Eventually, Carla agrees to let Olly come over for in-person visits. Carla monitors the visits and does not tell Maddy’s mother about them. Soon, Maddy and Olly’s relationship takes a romantic turn.
After Maddy impulsively rushes out of the house to intervene in a fight between Olly and his father, her mother finds out about the visits. She fires Carla. In the fall, Olly starts school. Maddy stays in touch with him and tries to repair her damaged relationship with her mother. Her mother gives her a framed photo of their family, taken in Hawaii shortly before her father and brother died. One day, Maddy decides to risk her life in order to live fully. She books a short trip for her and Olly, to Hawaii.
After Olly gets over his misgivings, he and Maddy fly to Hawaii. They spend a wonderful, intimate day together, but in the middle of the night, Maddy wakes up with aches and fever chills. Olly calls an ambulance to take her to the hospital. Meanwhile, Maddy’s mother has learned where they were and has boarded a flight to Hawaii. When she arrives, she puts Maddy on a plane back home.
Maddy and her mother try to resume life as before. Maddy misses Olly but believes she must shut her heart to the possibility of love. She deletes all of Olly’s emails, unread. Her mother, seeing how sad Maddy is, rehires Carla. Olly and his mother and sister move out of their house, leaving his father behind, alone.
Maddy receives an email from the doctor who treated her in Hawaii. The doctor questions whether Maddy has SCID and urges her to consult a doctor other than her mother. Confronted, Maddy’s mother insists that Maddy really is sick. Searching her mother’s office at night, however, Maddy finds no record of a SCID diagnosis, nor any records of the years of treatment. A specialist contacted by Carla confirms: Maddy does not have SCID. The shock and grief Maddy’s mother felt over losing her husband and son expressed itself as a pathological need to protect Maddy from all possibility of harm.
Maddy is angry at her mother and wants to leave home, but Carla counsels her to be more compassionate. Maddy books a flight to New York. During the flight, she begins to forgive her mother. In New York, she and Olly happily reunite."
Flatterer,"The narrator defends the story he is about to tell, which is framed as a dream. He explains that he fell asleep in the wilderness and dreamed of a man named Christian, who was tormented by spiritual anguish. A spiritual guide named Evangelist visits Christian and urges him to leave the City of Destruction. Evangelist claims that salvation can only be found in the Celestial City, known as Mount Zion.
Christian begs his family to accompany him, unsuccessfully. On his way, Christian falls into a bog called the Slough of Despond, but he is saved. He meets Worldly Wiseman, who urges him to lead a practical, happy existence without religion. Refusing, Christian is sheltered in Goodwill’s house. Goodwill tells Christian to stop by the Interpreter’s home, where Christian learns many lessons about faith.
Walking along the wall of Salvation, Christian sees Christ’s tomb and cross. At this vision, his burden falls to the ground. One of the three Shining Ones, celestial creatures, hands him a rolled certificate for entry to the Celestial City. Christian falls asleep and loses his certificate. Since the certificate is his ticket into the Celestial City, Christian reproaches himself for losing it. After retracing his tracks, he eventually finds the certificate. Walking on, Christian meets the four mistresses of the Palace Beautiful, who provide him shelter. They also feed him and arm him. After descending the Valley of Humiliation, Christian meets the monster Apollyon, who tries to kill him. Christian is armed, and he strikes Apollyon with a sword and then proceeds through the desert-like Valley of the Shadow of Death toward the Celestial City.
Christian meets Faithful, a traveler from his hometown. Faithful and Christian are joined by a third pilgrim, Talkative, whom Christian spurns. Evangelist arrives and warns Faithful and Christian about the wicked town of Vanity, which they will soon enter. Evangelist foretells that either Christian or Faithful will die in Vanity.
The two enter Vanity and visit its famous fair. They resist temptation and are mocked by the townspeople. Eventually the citizens of Vanity imprison Christian and Faithful for mocking their local religion. Faithful defends himself at his trial and is executed, rising to heaven after death. Christian is remanded to prison but later escapes and continues his journey.
Another fellow pilgrim named Hopeful befriends Christian on his way. On their journey, a pilgrim who uses religion as a means to get ahead in the world, named By-ends, crosses their path. Christian rejects his company. The two enter the plain of Ease, where a smooth talker named Demas tempts them with silver. Christian and Hopeful pass him by.
Taking shelter for the night on the grounds of Doubting Castle, they awake to the threats of the castle’s owner, the Giant Despair, who, with the encouragement of his wife, imprisons and tortures them. Christian and Hopeful escape when they remember they possess the key of Promise, which unlocks any door in Despair’s domain.
Proceeding onward, Christian and Hopeful approach the Delectable Mountains near the Celestial City. They encounter wise shepherds who warn them of the treacherous mountains Error and Caution, where previous pilgrims have died. The shepherds point out travelers who wander among tombs nearby, having been blinded by the Giant Despair. They warn the travelers to beware of shortcuts, which may be paths to hell.
The two pilgrims meet Ignorance, a sprightly teenager who believes that living a good life is sufficient to prove one’s religious faith. Christian refutes him, and Ignorance decides to avoid their company. The travelers also meet Flatterer, who snares them in a net, and Atheist, who denies that the Celestial City exists. Crossing the sleep-inducing Enchanted Ground, they try to stay awake by discussing Hopeful’s sinful past and religious doctrine.
Christian and Hopeful gleefully approach the land of Beulah, where the Celestial City is located. The landscape teems with flowers and fruit, and the travelers are refreshed. To reach the gate into the city, they must first cross a river without a bridge. Christian nearly drowns, but Hopeful reminds him of Christ’s love, and Christian emerges safely from the water. The residents of the Celestial City joyously welcome the two pilgrims. In his conclusion to Part I, the narrator expresses hope that his dream be interpreted properly.
In the Introduction to Part II, Bunyan addresses the book as “Christiana,” which is the name of Christian’s wife. This part of The Pilgrim’s Progress tells the story of Christiana and her children’s journey to the Celestial City. The narrator recounts having met an old man, Sagacity, who tells the beginning of Christiana’s story. She decides to pack up and follow Christian to the Celestial City, taking her four sons and a fellow townswoman named Mercy along as a servant. On the way, they cross the Slough of Despond but are blocked at the gate by an angry dog. The gatekeeper lets them through. Continuing on, the sons steal fruit from the devil’s garden, and two ruffians threaten to rape the women, but they escape.
The pilgrims are lodged in the Interpreter’s house. The Interpreter orders his manservant Great-heart to accompany them to the House Beautiful. Mr. Brisk pays court to Mercy but soon stops courting her because of her involvement in charity work. As a result of eating the devil’s fruit, Matthew falls ill but is cured by Dr. Skill.

Cherished,"Esperanza Rising is the story of Esperanza Ortega, the cherished only child of her Papa and Mama, Sixto and Ramona. Sixto Ortega is the wealthy landowner of El Rancho de las Rosas in Aguascalientes, Mexico. Esperanza lives the life of a rich young girl in 1920s Mexico, wearing beautiful clothes, living in a home with servants, and going to private school. Her grandmother, Abuelita, lives with the family, and they are attended by a housekeeper, Hortensia, and several farm workers, including Hortensia’s husband, Alfonso, and their son, Miguel. Esperanza’s father has taught her to love and respect the land, listening for its heartbeat.
Since the Mexican Revolution, bandits have threatened wealthy landowners like Esperanza’s father. On the day of the end of the grape harvest and the day before Esperanza’s birthday, Papa is robbed and killed by bandits in the fields. After the funeral, the family learns that while Sixto left the house to Mama and Esperanza, he left the ranch and its land to his older stepbrother Tío Luis. Luis and his brother Marco try to persuade Esperanza’s mother to marry Luis and remain on the ranch, or sell the house to Luis. Mama is worried that if she does not marry Luis, he will send Esperanza away or they will lose the house. After their home is burnt to the ground in what Luis hints may not have been an accident, Mama decides that she and Esperanza will join Alfonso, Hortensia, and Miguel to go to the United States for work, rather than be forced to stay with Luis. Abuelita has been injured in the fire, but will come to the United States when she has healed. Until then, she will stay with her sisters at a nearby convent.
After a long journey in a wagon and a cramped, dirty train car, Esperanza and Mama arrive with the others in California. Abuelita’s sisters at the convent have helped them get the correct papers to work in the United States. Alfonso’s brother Juan, his wife, Josefina, and their children bring the group to the field worker’s camp. On the way there, a worker named Marta joins them and taunts Esperanza, calling her a princess who is now a peasant. At the camp, the cabin where the extended family will live is small and poor, but Mama tells Esperanza that they must be grateful for it nonetheless.
Until she is old enough to work, Esperanza takes care of Juan and Josefina’s babies, Lupe and Pepe, with their older daughter, Isabel. Isabel must teach Esperanza housekeeping skills, because she will soon go to school and Esperanza will be left with the babies. Esperanza’s first attempt at a chore, sweeping the camp platform, does not go well, and she is humiliated when Marta calls her Cinderella. Marta is a migrant worker and an antagonizing force among the field workers, encouraging them to strike for better working conditions. At a fiesta called a jamaica, Esperanza watches as Marta and her friends try to rally the field workers before they are ordered to leave.
Over time, Esperanza learns to take care of the babies and the household. She calls on memories of childhood to fix a mistake she makes while feeding the babies, and joins two women, Irene and Melina, as they protect the children during a terrifying dust storm that overcomes the farm and fields. Esperanza’s family returns home after the storm covered in dust and dirt, and her mother cannot stop coughing. The striking workers encounter more difficulty, because the cotton fields where they were working have been ruined by the storm, and they will now have no work. A month passes, and Mama is now very ill. A doctor tells the family that she has Valley Fever, and her lungs are infected by dust spores from the storm. When winter comes and Mama begins to have trouble breathing, she goes to the hospital. Esperanza now has no choice but to work to earn money for herself and Mama, and for Abuelita to join them in California.
Esperanza learns the work quickly and saves her money, purchasing a money order every other week for Abuelita’s travel. She learns from Marta’s aunt that more strikes are being planned, and workers who do not join in could be in danger. Esperanza visits her mother every weekend, but Mama is still sick and depressed. She contracts pneumonia, and Esperanza cannot visit her for a month. On their way home from the hospital, Esperanza and Miguel pick up Marta and her mother Ada, taking them to the striker’s farm where they live. Marta warns Esperanza and Miguel again that they may be in danger if they do not join the strikes, but the family is cheered by news that Miguel has found a good, temporary job working for the railroad.
The field workers endure several days of strikers yelling and chanting at them, and placing dangerous animals and items in packing crates for the workers to find. One day, the strikers are silent, and for good reason. Immigration officers are finding them and deporting them back to Mexico, even if they are American citizens, because they are causing trouble for the government. Esperanza finds Marta hiding in a shed, and Marta begs Esperanza not to let her get caught. Esperanza agrees, and Marta apologizes for misjudging her. Esperanza hopes Marta can get back to Ada safely, but later discovers that the strikers have all been taken by the immigration officers. 
Esperanza’s frustration rises as she learns of injustices faced by Isabel at school and Miguel at work because they are Mexican. News of workers from Oklahoma receiving better living conditions anger her to the point where she storms out of the cabin. Miguel finds her, and tells her he still believes they can make a better life in the United States, while Esperanza believes they never will. Esperanza points out that Miguel is still a peasant, as he was in Mexico. Miguel retorts that she still thinks she is a queen. The next day, he leaves to look for work in northern California.
Esperanza’s mother is finally able to come home, and Esperanza tells her that she has almost saved enough money to bring Abuelita to them. She opens her bag to show her mother the money orders, but discovers that they are gone. Esperanza believes that Miguel took them before he left, which makes her furious.
When Miguel returns, he is not alone. He has used the money to bring Abuelita from Mexico to California. At the cabin, Abuelita is reunited with Mama and the rest of the family. Esperanza tells Abuelita everything that has happened over the past year, explaining her story by the seasons of fruits and vegetables that have passed. 
Later, Esperanza and Miguel go to the foothills beyond the farm to listen for the sound of the land’s heart beating. The sun rises and Esperanza feels like she is rising, too. A year after the tragedy of Papa’s death, the family celebrates Esperanza’s birthday."
Allegiance,"Nick Carraway, a young man from Minnesota, moves to New York in the summer of 1922 to learn about the bond business. He rents a house in the West Egg district of Long Island, a wealthy but unfashionable area populated by the new rich, a group who have made their fortunes too recently to have established social connections and who are prone to garish displays of wealth. Nick’s next-door neighbor in West Egg is a mysterious man named Jay Gatsby, who lives in a gigantic Gothic mansion and throws extravagant parties every Saturday night.
Nick is unlike the other inhabitants of West Egg—he was educated at Yale and has social connections in East Egg, a fashionable area of Long Island home to the established upper class. Nick drives out to East Egg one evening for dinner with his cousin, Daisy Buchanan, and her husband, Tom, an erstwhile classmate of Nick’s at Yale. Daisy and Tom introduce Nick to Jordan Baker, a beautiful, cynical young woman with whom Nick begins a romantic relationship. Nick also learns a bit about Daisy and Tom’s marriage: Jordan tells him that Tom has a lover, Myrtle Wilson, who lives in the valley of ashes, a gray industrial dumping ground between West Egg and New York City. Not long after this revelation, Nick travels to New York City with Tom and Myrtle. At a vulgar, gaudy party in the apartment that Tom keeps for the affair, Myrtle begins to taunt Tom about Daisy, and Tom responds by breaking her nose.
As the summer progresses, Nick eventually garners an invitation to one of Gatsby’s legendary parties. He encounters Jordan Baker at the party, and they meet Gatsby himself, a surprisingly young man who affects an English accent, has a remarkable smile, and calls everyone “old sport.” Gatsby asks to speak to Jordan alone, and, through Jordan, Nick later learns more about his mysterious neighbor. Gatsby tells Jordan that he knew Daisy in Louisville in 1917 and is deeply in love with her. He spends many nights staring at the green light at the end of her dock, across the bay from his mansion. Gatsby’s extravagant lifestyle and wild parties are simply an attempt to impress Daisy. Gatsby now wants Nick to arrange a reunion between himself and Daisy, but he is afraid that Daisy will refuse to see him if she knows that he still loves her. Nick invites Daisy to have tea at his house, without telling her that Gatsby will also be there. After an initially awkward reunion, Gatsby and Daisy reestablish their connection. Their love rekindled, they begin an affair.
After a short time, Tom grows increasingly suspicious of his wife’s relationship with Gatsby. At a luncheon at the Buchanans’ house, Gatsby stares at Daisy with such undisguised passion that Tom realizes Gatsby is in love with her. Though Tom is himself involved in an extramarital affair, he is deeply outraged by the thought that his wife could be unfaithful to him. He forces the group to drive into New York City, where he confronts Gatsby in a suite at the Plaza Hotel. Tom asserts that he and Daisy have a history that Gatsby could never understand, and he announces to his wife that Gatsby is a criminal—his fortune comes from bootlegging alcohol and other illegal activities. Daisy realizes that her allegiance is to Tom, and Tom contemptuously sends her back to East Egg with Gatsby, attempting to prove that Gatsby cannot hurt him.
When Nick, Jordan, and Tom drive through the valley of ashes, however, they discover that Gatsby’s car has struck and killed Myrtle, Tom’s lover. They rush back to Long Island, where Nick learns from Gatsby that Daisy was driving the car when it struck Myrtle, but that Gatsby intends to take the blame. The next day, Tom tells Myrtle’s husband, George, that Gatsby was the driver of the car. George, who has leapt to the conclusion that the driver of the car that killed Myrtle must have been her lover, finds Gatsby in the pool at his mansion and shoots him dead. He then fatally shoots himself.
Nick stages a small funeral for Gatsby, ends his relationship with Jordan, and moves back to the Midwest to escape the disgust he feels for the people surrounding Gatsby’s life and for the emptiness and moral decay of life among the wealthy on the East Coast. Nick reflects that just as Gatsby’s dream of Daisy was corrupted by money and dishonesty, the American dream of happiness and individualism has disintegrated into the mere pursuit of wealth. Though Gatsby’s power to transform his dreams into reality is what makes him “great,” Nick reflects that the era of dreaming—both Gatsby’s dream and the American dream—is over."
Blessed,"When Antonio Márez is almost seven years old, the old healer Ultima comes to stay with him and his family in their small house in Guadalupe, New Mexico. The family has taken in Ultima out of a respect for her healing powers, her knowledge of plant lore, and her long use of folk magic in service of the community. Though they have great respect for Ultima’s spirituality, the family, especially Antonio’s mother, is devoutly Catholic. Antonio’s father, Gabriel, is a former vaquero, or cowboy, who wandered the llano, the great plains of New Mexico. Antonio’s mother, María, is the daughter of farmers. Antonio’s parents now argue about their young son’s future; Gabriel hopes he will become a vaquero on the llano, and María hopes he will become a priest. When Antonio was born, Ultima served as his midwife and buried his afterbirth. As a result, it is now thought that she alone knows what lies in Antonio’s future.
Antonio spends a happy time with Ultima, learning about plants and trees and helping her gather herbs on the llano. One night, his innocence is threatened when he witnesses the death of Lupito, a soldier who recently returned from World War II. Lupito is shot to death by a mob after he kills the sheriff in a moment of post-traumatic delirium. After seeing Lupito’s death, Antonio begins to wonder about sin, death, and hell. Antonio walks to church with Ultima the next morning, and she tells him that each person must make his or her own moral choices, must choose a set of values to use to understand the world.
That fall, after helping his mother’s brothers, the Lunas, with their harvest, Antonio begins school. María presses Ultima to reveal Antonio’s destiny, and she replies sadly that he will be a man of learning. The war ends, and Antonio’s brothers return home. Gabriel is overjoyed because he hopes the return of his older sons means that the family will at last be able to move to California, as he has longed to do. But the brothers are surly, restless, and traumatized by the war. Before long, they each leave home to pursue independent lives. Antonio struggles to understand the conflict between his father and his brothers, but like so many of the moral questions that trouble him, it is too complicated for him to grasp. His mother tells him that he will understand when he begins to take Communion, and he begins to look forward anxiously to the day he will be old enough to do so.
Antonio’s friend Samuel takes him fishing and tells him the story of the golden carp, a river god who looks out for mankind. Antonio is moved by the story, but he does not know how to reconcile it with his Catholic beliefs. His beliefs are challenged again when his uncle Lucas is cursed by the satanic Trementina sisters. The priest is unable to cure him, but Ultima, with Antonio’s help, is able to banish the curse. Antonio realizes that there is no way to explain Ultima’s powers within the worldview of the Catholic church.
Antonio goes to visit the garden of Narciso, the town drunk. Afterward, they go to see the golden carp. Antonio’s friend Cico tells him that only true believers can see the carp. Cico says that if the people cannot stop sinning, the carp will flood the land to rid it of humanity’s evil. Antonio wishes sadly that there were a god of forgiveness. He idolizes the Virgin Mary because of the ideal of forgiveness that she represents.
One afternoon, Antonio witnesses an altercation between Narciso and Tenorio, the father of the wicked sisters who cursed Lucas. In a raging blizzard, Tenorio, who blames Ultima for the death of one of his daughters, goes out to kill the old woman. Narciso tries to stop him, and in front of Antonio, Tenorio shoots and kills Narciso. Antonio comes down with a high fever and has frightening and symbolic dreams.
At last, the time comes for Antonio to begin preparing for his Communion. But he seems to be surrounded by dissenting voices—that of his father, who seems to worship the earth more than he does the Christian God, and that of his friend Florence, who incisively points out the failings in Catholic thought. When Antonio finally takes Communion on Easter Sunday, he feels no different than he felt before. He still does not understand how there could be evil in the world or what kind of forgiveness is possible in a world of sin.
Ultima continues to teach Antonio lessons about moral independence and goodness. He goes with her to dispel the ghosts in a haunted house, and they discover that Tenorio has caused the haunting in order to take revenge on the man who owns the house. Ultima drives away the ghosts, but when the second of Tenorio’s daughters falls ill, he begins to regard Ultima with even more hatred. Not long after that, Florence drowns while swimming in the river. Ultima sends Antonio to stay with his uncles to recover from the shock, and he spends a happy summer with them, learning how to tend a farm. On the journey there, Antonio and Gabriel talk about some of the questions that have been bothering Antonio, and Gabriel tells him that he will end the conflict between the Márezes and the Lunas and let Antonio choose his own destiny.
As Antonio makes his way from his uncles’ fields to his grandfather’s house one day toward the end of the summer, a murderous Tenorio chases after him. Antonio escapes, but Tenorio shoots Ultima’s owl. When the owl dies, Ultima is doomed to die as well because the owl is her spiritual familiar, or guardian. Antonio sits with her at her bedside and buries the owl as she requests after she dies."
Involves,"Into the Wild contains two interconnected plots, one that involves directly represented action and another that involves the careful development of a psychological portrait of Christopher McCandless. The first plot tracks McCandless’s journey into the wild, while the second tracks the development of Krakauer’s, and, implicitly, the reader’s, understanding of McCandless’s character and motivations. Neither plot is presented in linear fashion, and the two often intersect through the presentation of subtle detail, description, and the elaboration of multiple possible lines of cause and effect. Krakauer serves as the narrator throughout the book.
Into the Wild begins with the discovery of Christopher McCandless’s body by a group of Alaskan hunters who visit Denali National Park and Preserve on a yearly excursion. They radio for help. The FBI arrives and removes the body. Krakauer then visits with Wayne Westerberg, who knew Christopher McCandless as “Alex McCandless” and who provides an initial character sketch of the young man, Krakauer in a bar in Carthage, Wisconsin. Westerberg employed McCandless on and off on his grain elevator and remembers him as engaging, intelligent, and determined. Details from McCandless’s comfortable, middle-class Virginia upbringing and his dislike of materialism further Krakauer’s understanding of the young man. These same details take the narrator back to the first leg of McCandless’s journey west in his used yellow Datsun.
Just after graduating from college, McCandless drives to Lake Mead in Nevada, where a flashflood wets the engine of the Datsun. He leaves it and a number of other possessions behind. After two months of tramping, he buys a canoe on impulse and paddles down the Colorado River to Mexico. The journey takes five months. In the meantime, the McCandless family begins investigating their son’s disappearance. After his canoeing excursion, McCandless lives and works in Bullhead City, Arizona. An old man named Charlie takes him in briefly, before McCandless departs and meets Jan Buress and her old boyfriend in California. He engages in the social life of Buress’s drifters’ camp but leaves hastily, intending to embark on his trip to Alaska. Krakauer receives a letter from and then meets Ronald Franz, who describes to Krakauer the father-son relationship he established with McCandless. The narrator uses Franz’s story to initiate a line of investigation into the harm McCandless’s risk-taking behavior caused others.
Krakauer next visits Wayne Westerberg again and reconstructs McCandless’s last month in Carthage, South Dakota by speaking with Westerberg’s girlfriend and his mother. He acquires insight into McCandless’s troubled relationship with his father and relates that in late April, 1992, McCandless sent his friends postcards revealing that he was leaving for the wild, perhaps never to return. Krakauer’s investigation then move through his revelation that many readers of his original Outdoor magazine article about McCandless thought that Christopher McCandless was an incompetent, romantic fool. In response, Krakauer embarks on the telling of the stories of three other twentieth century wilderness fanatics who disappeared or died in the wild. He evaluates each and decides that McCandless has the most in common the young artist Everett Ruess.
Back at the bus in Alaska, state troopers attempt to identify McCandless’s body. Jim Gallien reads about the finding of the corpse and then contacts the police, setting off a string of events that lead to the identification of the body. Krakauer next visits with McCandless’s family, beginning with his father, Walt McCandless, and his mother, Billie McCandless. Billie shows Krakauer photographs of Christopher’s childhood and Walt describes the heartbreak his son has caused the family. Krakauer’s investigation then picks up a new subject: McCandless’s frustration with his family. When McCandless graduated from high school, he went on a trip to California and discovered that his father had been a bigamist. Krakauer theorizes that McCandless’s anger at this long-kept family secret offers some motivation for his desire to leave his life behind.
Krakauer then dedicates two chapters to his own ascent of the Devils Thumb. These parallel the plot of McCandless’s journey. Krakauer attempts the glacier’s north face and is rebuffed, then spends three days trapped at his base camp. After accidentally setting his tent on fire, he makes a desperate attempt at the southeast face and succeeds. Recalling this story allows Krakauer conclude that Christopher McCandless must not have been suicidal when he began his trip.
Jon Krakauer’s own trip to Denali National Park and the abandoned bus where McCandless died closes out the narrative. Along with three experienced Alaskans, Krakauer crosses the same river whose flooding prevented McCandless from leaving the wild. The four hikers encounter the bus in the late evening and examine its contents. Everything seems to have been as McCandless left it. The party eats dinner and reflects on the circumstances that could have led McCandless to head into the wild. In an epilogue, the author visits the bus again with Walt and Billie McCandless, Christopher McCandless’s mother and father."
Childhood,"Marjane “Marji” Satrapi is an intelligent, spirited, and very modern girl living with her parents in Iran’s capital of Tehran during the eventful period of Iranian history from the late 1970s into the early 1980s. In Persepolis: The Story of a Childhood, Marji’s remembers her life during those years, mostly from when she was about ten to age fourteen. This account includes how Marji and her family lived through and were affected by turbulent events that included the overthrow of the autocratic Shah of Iran by the Islamic revolution, the oppressive fundamentalist regime that replaced the Shah, and the devasting Iran-Iraq war.
The nation’s wealth has long made it a target of outside invaders, but Islamic revolution of 1979 has pushed out the Western-backed government of the Shah.  The revolution has ushered in a new Islamic regime that is bringing massive societal changes impacting how people are supposed to behave--including Marji and her family. Marji struggles to adjust to the changes at her liberal French bilingual school, which has become increasingly stricter. Girls are required to wear veils and female and male students are now separated. Marji’s wealthy and modern parents—her father, Ebi, and her mother, Taji—take part in the massive protests against the new regime’s strict rules on behavior (just as they had previously protested against the Shah’s regime). Marji’s parents worry when a photo of Marji’s mother a protest appears in newspapers magazines. Later, after a demonstration they are at turns violent, the Satrapis decide that openly protesting is too dangerous to continue to do.
Marji feels conflict between her own deeply spiritual feelings and the stark modernism of her parents. She talks to God at night and has believed she will become a prophet one day since she was six years old, Marji. But the revolution leads to Marji setting aside these ambitions while she studies and imitates protestors and revolutionaries. She mimics protestors in the garden of her house and studies books about famous revolutionaries and philosophers given to her by her parents. She fantasizes about becoming a hero and wants her parents to become heroes too. Marji’s relationship with God becomes strained, as she finds that she and God have less to talk about—although God does still come by to see her from time to time.
Marji thrills when she learns that rebels fill her family history. She learns that her grandfather was a prince and later a communist whom the Shah removed from power and that her uncle Anoosh, also a communist, spent nine years in prison during the Shah’s regime. Marji spends a short time with Anoosh, learning about his life. After the Shah fell from power in 1979, Anoosh was released from prison, but when Islamic fundamentalists consolidate their grip on power, they hunt Anoosh down, imprison him, and later execute him. Her new idol killed, Marji feels crushed. She completely abandons her faith in God and increasingly questions the pro-regime propaganda she hears—especially at school.
Marji deeply loves and identifies with of her parents, even if she does sometimes feel that their actions and behavior (as wealthy and privileged individuals) do not always live up to their pro-democratic and liberal rhetoric. Marji also has a special connection with her grandmother, who remains stoic and inspiring to Marji in spite of the turmoil and numerous tragedies stemming from political actions that impact her and the family. Marji’s uncle Anoosh is not Marji’s only direct experience with the cruel consequences of the government’s actions. Throughout the book, death and devastation occurs among Marji’s extended family and friends as direct results of the brutality and fanaticism of the Iranian regimes and the war with Iraq.
People had rejoiced when the Shah was forced out, but as Islamic fundamentalists retain power, Marji and her family watch as their neighbors’ behavior shifts back and forth to coincide with the current political winds. The neighbors go from wearing short skirts and drinking alcohol to covering themselves and denouncing the use of alcohol. Marji’s parents ask her to tell everyone that she prays every day, a lie they hope will keep Marji safe, but acknowledge that the rules seem foolish. Marji grows more rebellious, as she increasingly views the rules at school and elsewhere as hypocritical and difficult to follow. Armed with more knowledge and personal experience, Marji begins to act out in ways that put her safety at risk. In fact, she even (accidentally) hits her principal during an argument, which results in her expulsion from school. Fearing her rebellious behavior will get her killed, Marji’s mother tries to reason with Marji by telling her that it is not her responsibility to serve justice and that the bad guys eventually pay for their sins in the end.
The war with Iraq had originally inspired Marji to vocal patriotism in protection her country against another invasion, but Marji begins to realize there are greater forces behind the war. She sees how the Islamic regime needs the war to continue survive and keep power. The war promotes a sense of nationalism and pride in the public, and those who die in the war are hailed as “martyrs.” Marji sees thousands of poor boys lured into war without proper training. She becomes increasingly uncomfortable and aware of class differences within society. Poor young boys are lured into the army with gold-painted keys to the “kingdom of heaven” to help them enter paradise after dying on the battlefield, while children in her wealthy neighborhood are left alone.
More and more people try to escape Iran as the borders tighten and Iraqi forces bomb Tehran and other Iranian cities. Realizing that Marji’s chances of escaping Iran are narrowing, her parents make the difficult decision to send her abroad alone to finish school in Vienna, explaining that only a good education will free her of Iran. Marji feels heartbroken. She spends one last night with her grandmother, who gives her warm advice and inspires her to be compassionate and understanding while in Vienna. Marji gives away all of her prized contraband to her friends, including a Kim Wilde poster. At the airport, as Marji turns to say goodbye to her parents one last time to see that her mother, devasted by her only child’s departure, has fainted."
Philippines,"Returning home to the Laguna Pueblo reservation from World War II, via a Veteran's Hospital, Tayo must find a way to cure himself of his mental anguish, and to bring the rain back to his community. Combining prose and poetry, Ceremony interweaves the individual story of Tayo and the collective story of his people. As Tayo's journey unfolds, it is paralleled by poems telling old stories.
The trauma of thinking he saw his uncle Josiah's face among a crowd of Japanese soldiers he was ordered to shoot, and then of watching his cousin Rocky die, drove Tayo out of his mind. A period of time in a Veterans' Hospital gets him well enough to return to his home, with his Grandmother, his Auntie, and her husband Robert. This is the family unit that raised him after his mother, who had conceived him with an unknown white man, left him for good at the age of four. In his family's home Tayo faces not only their disappointment at the loss of Rocky, but also his continued grieving over his favorite uncle Josiah's death. He also contends with his guilt over a prayer against the rain he uttered in the forests of the Philippines, which he thinks is responsible for the six-year drought on the reservation.
As he slowly recuperates, Tayo realizes that he is not alone. His childhood friends Harley, Leroy, Emo, and Pinkie who also fought in the war contend with similar post-traumatic stress, self-medicating with alcohol. The company is little comfort. His old friends spend their drunken hours reminiscing about how great the war was and how much respect they got while they were in uniform. These stories only make Tayo think about the tremendous discrimination the Native Americans face at the hands of the whites, whom they nonetheless seem to admire, and he is even more saddened and infuriated. Just as Tayo begins to give up hope and to wish he could return to the VA hospital, his grandmother calls in the medicine man, Ku'oosh. Ku'oosh performs for Tayo a ceremony for warriors who have killed in battle, but both Ku'oosh and Tayo fear that the ancient ceremonies are not applicable to this new situation.
Tayo is helped but not cured by Ku'oosh's ceremony. It prompts him to consider his childhood, especially the summer before he left for the army. Although Auntie did her best to keep the two boys separate, Tayo and Rocky became close friends, and the summer after they graduated from high school, they enlisted in the army together. That summer, Josiah fell in love with Night Swan, a Mexican woman who lived just outside the reservation. At her urging, he invested in a herd of Mexican cattle, which Tayo helped him to care for. As so often happens, there is a drought that summer. Having heard the old stories of how droughts are ended, Tayo goes to a spring and invents a rain ceremony. The following day it rains. In addition to helping the crops and the cattle, the rain keeps Josiah from visiting Night Swan. He asks Tayo to bring her a note. Tayo delivers the note, and in the process is seduced by Night Swan.
Realizing that his ceremony has not been enough for Tayo, Ku'oosh sends him to the nearby town of Gallup to see another medicine man, Betonie, who knows more about the problems incurred by the contact between Native American and white cultures. Although he is skeptical of Betonie's strange ways and especially high connection with the white world, Tayo tells him of his what is troubling him. Betonie listens and explains that they must invent and complete a new ceremony. Tayo accepts. Betonie tells Tayo stores of the old ceremonies as he performs them. Then Betonie tells Tayo stories of his grandfather, Descheeny, and the beginning of the creation of a new ceremony to stop the destruction the whites, an invention of Native American witchery, are wreaking on the world.
Betonie sends Tayo back home, reminding him that the ceremony is still far from complete. When he meets Harley and Leroy on the way home, Tayo slips back into their lifestyle for a moment, but soon moves on, heeding the signs Betonie told him of as he searches for Josiah's cattle. Tayo follows the stars to a woman's house. After spending a night with the woman, Ts'eh, Tayo heads up into the mountains. He finds Josiah's cattle fenced into a white man's pasture. While Tayo breaks into the pasture, the cattle run off to its far reaches, and Tayo spends all night looking for them. As dawn approaches, Tayo is about to give up when a mountain lion comes up to him. Tayo honors the mountain lion, and follows its tracks to the cattle. Just as he herds the cattle out of the pasture, two white patrolmen find Tayo. Not realizing that the cattle are missing, but knowing Tayo has trespassed, the patrolmen arrest Tayo. Before they can bring him to town, however, they notice the mountain lion tracks and let Tayo go in order to hunt it. As Tayo heads out, it begins to snow. Tayo knows this will cover the tracks of his cattle and of the mountain lion, making the patrolmens' efforts fruitless. On the way down the mountain, Tayo meets a hunter, who lives with Ts'eh. When they arrive back at her house, she has corralled Tayo's cattle, which she keeps until Tayo and Robert return with a cattle truck to gather them up.
Returning home with Josiah's cattle, Tayo feels cured. However, the drought persists, and Tayo knows the ceremony is not complete. He goes to the family's ranch with the cattle, where he finds Ts'eh . They spend the summer together, but as it draws to an end Robert visits and warns Tayo that Emo has been spreading rumors about him. Shortly thereafter, Ts'eh tells Tayo that Emo and the white police are coming after him. Before she leaves, she tells Tayo how to avoid capture.
Following Ts'eh's instructions, Tayo easily evades the white police. Still running from Emo, he meets Harley and Leroy. Almost too late, Tayo realizes that Harley and Leroy have joined forces with Emo. Running again, Tayo finds himself in an abandoned uranium mine. As he looks at the gaping hole left in the earth, Tayo realizes that this is the last station of his ceremony, the one where he incorporates an element of white culture, the mine. All he has to do is to spend the night there and the ceremony will be complete. Soon Emo and Pinkie arrive. From a hiding place, Tayo must watch them torture Harley to death, and restrain himself from killing Emo in order to save Harley. With the help of the wind, Tayo survives the night. He returns home and goes back to Ku'oosh. After hearing all about Tayo's ceremony, Ku'oosh pronounces that Ts'eh was in fact A'moo'ooh, who has given her blessings to Tayo and his ceremony; the drought is ended and the destruction of the whites is stopped. Tayo spends one last night in Ku'oosh's house to finish off the ceremony, and then he returns home."
Persuasion,"Persuasion opens with a brief history of the Elliot family as recorded in Sir Walter Elliot's favorite book, The Baronetcy. We learn that the Elliots are a respected, titled, landowning family. Lady Elliot, Sir Walter's wife died fourtee n years ago and left him with three daughters: Elizabeth, Anne, and Mary. Both Elizabeth and Anne are single, but Mary, the youngest is married to a wealthy man named Charles Musgrove; they live close by. Sir Walter, who lavishly overspends, has brought the family into great debt. When Lady Russell, a trusted family advisor, suggests that the Elliots reduce their spending, Sir Walter is horrified. He is exceedingly vain and cannot bear to imagine life without his usual comforts. But with no other option, the Elliots decide they must relocate to a house in Bath where their expenses will be more manageable. They intend to rent the family estate, Kellynch Hall.
They soon find excellent tenants to rent their home; Admiral and Mrs. Croft are wealthy and well-mannered Navy people who have a model marriage. Sir Walter is relieved that the Admiral is a good-looking man. Though Sir Walter dislikes that the Navy brings ""men of obscure birth into undue distinction,"" he is satisfied with Admiral and Mrs. Croft as tenants for his home. Anne Elliot, the middle daughter, is also excited to meet the Crofts; Mrs. Croft is the sister of the man Anne loves. Eight years ago, she was engaged to be married to Captain Frederick Wentworth, but Lady Russell persuaded her that Captain Wentworth was not of high enough consequence, and Anne called off the engagement. With the Crofts at Kellynch, Anne hopes to see Captain Wentworth again.
Sir Walter, Elizabeth, and Mrs. Clay (a widowed, somewhat lower-class friend of the family) leave for Bath. Anne goes to stay with her sister Mary at Uppercross Cottage for a period of two months. Mary complains often and Anne patiently listens to her sister's worries. At Uppercross, Anne finds the Musgrove family delightful. Mr. and Mrs. Musgrove have three grown children: Charles (Mary's husband), Henrietta, and Louisa. Anne marvels at the bustling nature of the household and the Musgroves' clear affection for their children. Soon news comes that Captain Wentworth has returned from sea and is staying with his sister at Kellynch. Captain Wentworth makes friends with Mr. Musgrove, and he becomes a daily visitor at Uppercross. Anne is at first anxious to see him again after such a long time, but his actions toward her are merely detached and polite. He seems more smitten with Henrietta and Louisa Musgrove. Anne resigns herself to the idea that she has lost Captain Wentworth's love forever.
Captain Wentworth proposes that they all take a trip to Lyme to go visit his friends the Harvilles. While they are there, a good-looking gentleman takes notice of Anne; they later discover that this man is Mr. Elliot, Anne's cousin and Sir Walter' s heir to Kellynch. The group decides to go for a morning walk on the beach. Louisa Musgrove has a bad fall and is knocked unconscious. Anne keeps a level head and does all she can to care for Louisa. The doctor determines that Louisa will recover, but she will have to remain in Lyme for several months. Captain Wentworth blames himself for Louisa's fall and tries to help the Musgrove family. Anne returns to Uppercross to help Mr. and Mrs. Musgrove care for their younger children. After a few weeks, she leaves to stay with Lady Russell.
After Christmas, Lady Russell and Anne decide that they must rejoin the rest of the Elliot family in Bath, much to Anne's dismay. Sir Walter and Elizabeth care little about her, but they are glad to have her come to Bath. In Bath, she is formally introduced to her cousin Mr. Elliot, who has made peace with his once estranged uncle, Sir Walter. Though she questions Mr. Elliot's motives for his sudden apology, she accepts him as a pleasing gentleman. Mr. Elliot is extraordinarily appreciative of Anne, and i t is soon apparent that he seeks to make her his wife. While in Bath, Anne becomes reacquainted with an old school friend, Mrs. Smith, who has recently been widowed and fallen into hard times. From Mrs. Smith, Anne learns about Mr. Elliot's hidden past; she finds out that he has mistreated Mrs. Smith and that he plans to marry Anne to ensure that he becomes the sole heir of the Kellynch baronetcy. Mr. Elliot fears that Sir Walter will marry Mrs. Clay, have a son, and thereby deprive him of his title. He plots to ensure that he will remain Sir Walter's heir. Anne is appalled to hear this news.
The Crofts arrive in Bath with news of two engagements; Henrietta will marry her cousin Charles Hayter, and Louisa will marry Captain Benwick, a man she met at Lyme while she was convalescing. Anne is overjoyed that Captain Wentworth is not promised to Louisa and is free once again. Captain Wentworth soon arrives in Bath. He is now a much richer man than he was eight years ago, and Sir Walter reluctantly admits him into their social circle. Wentworth grows jealous because he believes Anne is attached to her cousin Mr. Elliot. Yet he writes Anne a love letter in which he describes his true, constant, and undying love for her. Anne is thrilled and they become engaged. Mr. Elliot is shocked that his plan to marry Anne has been foiled. He and Mrs. Clay leave Bath. It is rumored that they are together. There is no longer any danger that Sir Walter will marry beneath his station. Sir Walter and Lady Russell give their approval for the marriage between Anne and Captain Wentworth."
What,"A Raisin in the Sun portrays a few weeks in the life of the Youngers, a Black family living on the South Side of Chicago in the 1950s. When the play opens, the Youngers are about to receive an insurance check for $10,000. This money comes from the deceased Mr. Younger’s life insurance policy. Each of the adult members of the family has an idea as to what he or she would like to do with this money. The matriarch of the family, Mama, wants to buy a house to fulfill a dream she shared with her husband. Mama’s son, Walter Lee, would rather use the money to invest in a liquor store with his friends. He believes that the investment will solve the family’s financial problems forever. Walter’s wife, Ruth, agrees with Mama, however, and hopes that she and Walter can provide more space and opportunity for their son, Travis. Finally, Beneatha, Walter’s sister and Mama’s daughter, wants to use the money for her medical school tuition. She also wishes that her family members were not so interested in assimilating into the white world. Beneatha instead tries to find her identity by looking back to the past and to Africa.
As the play progresses, the Youngers clash over their competing dreams. Ruth discovers that she is pregnant but fears that if she has the child, she will put more financial pressure on her family members. When Walter says nothing to Ruth’s admission that she is considering abortion, Mama puts a down payment on a house for the whole family. She believes that a bigger, brighter dwelling will help them all. This house is in Clybourne Park, an entirely white neighborhood. When the Youngers’ future neighbors find out that the Youngers are moving in, they send Mr. Lindner, from the Clybourne Park Improvement Association, to offer the Youngers money in return for staying away. The Youngers refuse the deal, even after Walter loses the rest of the money ($6,500) to his friend Willy Harris, who persuades Walter to invest in the liquor store and then runs off with his cash.
In the meantime, Beneatha rejects her suitor, George Murchison, whom she believes to be shallow and blind to the problems of race. Subsequently, she receives a marriage proposal from her Nigerian boyfriend, Joseph Asagai, who wants Beneatha to get a medical degree and move to Africa with him (Beneatha does not make her choice before the end of the play). The Youngers eventually move out of the apartment, fulfilling the family’s long-held dream. Their future seems uncertain and slightly dangerous, but they are optimistic and determined to live a better life. They believe that they can succeed if they stick together as a family and resolve to defer their dreams no longer."
Prohibit,"Winston Smith is a low-ranking member of the ruling Party in London, in the nation of Oceania. Everywhere Winston goes, even his own home, the Party watches him through telescreens; everywhere he looks he sees the face of the Party’s seemingly omniscient leader, a figure known only as Big Brother. The Party controls everything in Oceania, even the people’s history and language. Currently, the Party is forcing the implementation of an invented language called Newspeak, which attempts to prevent political rebellion by eliminating all words related to it. Even thinking rebellious thoughts is illegal. Such thoughtcrime is, in fact, the worst of all crimes.
As the novel opens, Winston feels frustrated by the oppression and rigid control of the Party, which prohibits free thought, sex, and any expression of individuality. Winston dislikes the party and has illegally purchased a diary in which to write his criminal thoughts. He has also become fixated on a powerful Party member named O’Brien, whom Winston believes is a secret member of the Brotherhood—the mysterious, legendary group that works to overthrow the Party.
Winston works in the Ministry of Truth, where he alters historical records to fit the needs of the Party. He notices a coworker, a beautiful dark-haired girl, staring at him, and worries that she is an informant who will turn him in for his thoughtcrime. He is troubled by the Party’s control of history: the Party claims that Oceania has always been allied with Eastasia in a war against Eurasia, but Winston seems to recall a time when this was not true. The Party also claims that Emmanuel Goldstein, the alleged leader of the Brotherhood, is the most dangerous man alive, but this does not seem plausible to Winston. Winston spends his evenings wandering through the poorest neighborhoods in London, where the proletarians, or proles, live squalid lives, relatively free of Party monitoring.
One day, Winston receives a note from the dark-haired girl that reads “I love you.” She tells him her name, Julia, and they begin a covert affair, always on the lookout for signs of Party monitoring. Eventually they rent a room above the secondhand store in the prole district where Winston bought the diary. This relationship lasts for some time. Winston is sure that they will be caught and punished sooner or later (the fatalistic Winston knows that he has been doomed since he wrote his first diary entry), while Julia is more pragmatic and optimistic. As Winston’s affair with Julia progresses, his hatred for the Party grows more and more intense. At last, he receives the message that he has been waiting for: O’Brien wants to see him.
Winston and Julia travel to O’Brien’s luxurious apartment. As a member of the powerful Inner Party (Winston belongs to the Outer Party), O’Brien leads a life of luxury that Winston can only imagine. O’Brien confirms to Winston and Julia that, like them, he hates the Party, and says that he works against it as a member of the Brotherhood. He indoctrinates Winston and Julia into the Brotherhood, and gives Winston a copy of Emmanuel Goldstein’s book, the manifesto of the Brotherhood. Winston reads the book—an amalgam of several forms of class-based twentieth-century social theory—to Julia in the room above the store. Suddenly, soldiers barge in and seize them. Mr. Charrington, the proprietor of the store, is revealed as having been a member of the Thought Police all along.
Torn away from Julia and taken to a place called the Ministry of Love, Winston finds that O’Brien, too, is a Party spy who simply pretended to be a member of the Brotherhood in order to trap Winston into committing an open act of rebellion against the Party. O’Brien spends months torturing and brainwashing Winston, who struggles to resist. At last, O’Brien sends him to the dreaded Room 101, the final destination for anyone who opposes the Party. Here, O’Brien tells Winston that he will be forced to confront his worst fear. Throughout the novel, Winston has had recurring nightmares about rats; O’Brien now straps a cage full of rats onto Winston’s head and prepares to allow the rats to eat his face. Winston snaps, pleading with O’Brien to do it to Julia, not to him.
Giving up Julia is what O’Brien wanted from Winston all along. His spirit broken, Winston is released to the outside world. He meets Julia but no longer feels anything for her. He has accepted the Party entirely and has learned to love Big Brother."
Patient,"In The English Patient, the past and the present are continually intertwined. The narrative structure intersperses descriptions of present action with thoughts and conversations that offer glimpses of past events and occurrences. Though there is no single narrator, the story is alternatively seen from the point of view of each of the main characters.
The novel opens with Hana, a young nurse, gardening outside a villa in Italy in 1945. The European theater of the war has just ended with the Germans retreating up the Italian countryside. As the Germans retreated, they left hidden bombs and mines everywhere, so the landscape is particularly dangerous. Although the other nurses and patients have left the villa to escape to a safer place, Hana decides to stay in the villa with her patient.
Hana does not know much about the man for whom she cares. Found in the wreckage of a plane crash, he been burned beyond recognition, his whole body black and even the slightest touch painful to him. He talks about the Bedouin tribe who found him in the wreckage, cared for his wounds, and eventually returned him to a British camp in 1944. He does not know who they were, but he feels grateful to them nonetheless. To pass the time, Hana reads to the English patient—she assumes he is English by his manner and speech—and also gardens, fixes up the villa, and plays hopscotch. Sometimes she picks up the patient's notebook, a copy of Herodotus's The Histories marked throughout with his own notes, figures, and observations, and reads to him or to herself.
One day, a man with bandaged hands named Caravaggio arrives at the villa. He is an old family friend of Hana's father, Patrick, and had heard about her location while he was recovering in a hospital a few miles away. In Canada, where Caravaggio knew Hana years ago, he was a thief. He tells her how his skills were legitimized in the war and how he put them to use working for British Intelligence in North Africa. He tells her that the Germans caught him after an attempt to steal a camera from a woman's room. They tortured him and cut off his thumbs, leaving his hands mutilated and nearly useless. Although he has recovered somewhat, he is still addicted to morphine. In the villa, he reminisces with Hana and mourns with her over the death of her father in the war.
As Hana plays the piano in the library, two soldiers come in and stand alongside while she plays. One of them is Kip, an Indian Sikh trained as a sapper, or bomb-defuser, in the British army. After hearing the piano, Kip has come to clear the villa of bombs, knowing that the Germans frequently booby-trapped musical instruments. Kip and the English patient get along very well, as they are both experts in guns and bombs and enjoy talking to each other and sharing stories. Kip makes camp in the garden of the villa and becomes a part of the ""family"" that now exists there. He goes off into town every day to clear more bombs from the area and to bury fellow sappers who have died. Kip's job is extremely dangerous. He feels a strong attraction to Hana, and soon they become lovers.
Asked about his past, the English patient begins to tell the others his story. His real name is Almasy, though this is not definitively confirmed until Chapter IX. He spent the years from 1930 to the start of World War II exploring the North African desert. His job was to make observations, draw maps, and search for ancient oases in the sands. Along with his fellow European counterparts, Almasy knew every inch of the desert and made many trips across it. In 1936, a young man from Oxford, Geoffrey Clifton, and his new wife Katharine, joined their party. Geoffrey owned a plane, which the party found especially useful in helping to map the desert. The explorers, Almasy, and the Cliftons got along very well. One night, after hearing Katharine read a passage from his book of Herodotus, Almasy realized he was in love with her. They soon began a torrid and tumultuous affair. Everywhere they stole glances and moments, and they were obsessed with each other. Finally, in 1938, Katharine broke off their affair, telling Almasy that Geoffrey would go mad if he ever found out. Although their affair was over, Almasy remained haunted by her, and he tried to punish her for hurting him by being particularly mean to her in public. At some point, Geoffrey somehow found out about the affair.
World War II broke out in 1939, and Almasy decided to close up their camp and arranged for Geoffrey to pick him up in the desert. Geoffrey arrived in his plane with Katharine. Geoffrey attempted to kill all three of them by crashing the plane into Almasy, who was standing on the ground. The plane missed Almasy, but the crash killed Geoffrey, left Katharine severely injured, and left them with no way to escape the desert. Almasy placed Katharine in a nearby cave, covering her with a parachute for warmth, and promised to come back for her. He walked across the desert for four days until he reached the nearest town, but when he got there, the English army would not help him get back to Katharine. Because Almasy had a foreign-sounding name, the British were suspicious and locked him up as a spy, prevented him from saving Katharine.
Almasy was eventually released, but he knew it was too late to save her. He worked for the Germans, helping their spies make their way across the desert into Cairo. After he left Cairo, his truck broke down in the desert. Without transportation, he walked to the cave to get Katharine. He took her dead body and placed it in a plane that had been buried beneath the sand. The plane malfunctioned during their flight and caught fire. Almasy parachuted down from the plane, his body covered in flames. That was the point at which the Bedouins found him and cared for his burns.
Little by little, the English patient tells this whole story. Caravaggio, who has suspected the English patient was not really English, has his suspicions confirmed. He fills in gaps for the Almasy, telling him that Geoffrey Clifton was really an agent of British Intelligence and that Intelligence had known about Almasy and Katharine's affair the whole time. They knew Almasy had started helping the Germans and planned to kill him in the desert. They lost him between Cairo and the plane crash, and now, of course, he is unrecognizable.
The focus of the novel shifts to Kip, and we are told his entire story. Although Kip's brother always distrusted the west, Kip went willingly to serve in the British army. He was trained as a bomb defuser under Lord Suffolk, a true English gentleman, and was then virtually welcomed into an English family. Kip soon grew quite skillful at his job, able to figure out both the ""joke"" and the ""character"" of each bomb he tackled. Lord Suffolk and his group were blown up defusing a bomb, and Kip decided to leave England and become a sapper in Italy.
Kip has felt emotionally removed from everyone in his job as a sapper. When he meets Hana, he uses her to once again connect to humanity. All the residents of the villa celebrate Hana's twenty-first birthday, and Kip grows comfortable as her lover. When August comes, however, Kip hears on the radio of the atomic bomb that the United States has dropped on Japan. He becomes enraged, knowing that a western country would never commit such an atrocity against another white country. He takes his gun and threatens to kill the English patient, whom he sees as a symbol of the West. Kip does not kill Almasy, but takes off on his motorcycle, leaving the villa forever. Years later, he is a doctor in India with a family of his own. Though he is happy and fulfilled in his new life, he often wonders about Hana."
Detroit,"Cal Stephanides is an intersex man living in Berlin, Germany. In an exercise of self-discovery, he decides to write his life story, starting with the history of the recessive gene that causes his intersex condition. The story begins with his grandparents in a tiny village on Mount Olympus in 1922. Lefty and Desdemona are siblings who have fallen in love with each other. After their parents’ deaths, they decide to immigrate to Detroit, where their cousin Sourmelina lives, and they head for the city of Smyrna to search for a boat to take them to mainland Greece. They escape the devastating burning of Smyrna by the Turkish army and find passage to America. On the ship, Lefty and Desdemona pretend to meet for the first time and then they wed. In Detroit, they move in with Sourmelina and her husband, Jimmy Zizmo. Zizmo takes Lefty into his alcohol smuggling business. After Desdemona and Sourmelina get pregnant on the same night, Zizmo worries that Sourmelina might be cheating on him with Lefty. He takes Lefty on a drive on the ice in order to interrogate him, but the car falls into the water. Lefty escapes.
In 1945, Lefty and Desdemona’s son, Milton, develops a crush on Zizmo and Sourmelina’s daughter, Tessie. Desdemona encourages Tessie to accept the proposal of a seminary student, Michael, causing Milton to join the Navy in a fit of rage. When Tessie realizes Milton will likely die in the U.S. invasion of Japan, she calls off her engagement to Michael. After excelling on a test, Milton receives a transfer to the officer’s academy and is spared fighting in the rest of the war. He and Tessie marry and have a son named Chapter Eleven. Five years later, both of them wish for a daughter, and Milton convinces Tessie to try to conceive a girl using pseudo-scientific methods for timing ovulation. The resulting baby, Calliope (Callie), will later become Cal. After retiring from the Navy, Milton takes over Lefty’s bar and turns it into a diner. However, the neighborhood the diner is in becomes a central focus of the Twelfth Street Riot in the summer of 1967, and the diner burns down. Because Lefty had taken out three insurance policies on the building, the family has enough money to move to the affluent suburb of Grosse Pointe. They move into an unusual house on a street named Middlesex.
Now seven years old, Callie is an arrestingly beautiful girl who desperately wants to make friends in her new neighborhood. The girl next door, Clementine Stark, invites her over and asks if they can practice kissing. Although Callie is too young to put words to it, her heart flutters. For high school, Tessie and Milton send Callie to an all-girls prep school to escape the governor’s orders to better integrate Detroit’s schools. Now nearly fourteen, Callie worries that she has not yet gotten her period or started to grow breasts. She begins to develop a moustache, and she grows the hair on her head long to hide her face. Soon, she develops a crush on a classmate that Cal, as narrator, refers to as “the Obscure Object.” When the girls are in a play together, Callie and the Object become friends, and the Object invites Callie to her family’s summer home. Eventually, she and the Object begin a physical relationship. When the Object’s brother, Jerome, realizes what has happened, he bullies his sister, and Callie attacks him. Callie flees and is hit by a tractor. At the hospital, the doctors realize that Callie is biologically male. Tessie and Milton don’t want to believe this is true and take Callie to a specialist in New York named Dr. Luce.
Dr. Luce is excited to meet Callie because he believes he can use her to prove his theory that gender is a social construct. Callie visits the library and looks up words she hears Dr. Luce use when he describes her to other doctors, which brings her to the words “hermaphrodite” and “monster.” Dr. Luce, deciding that Callie is a girl, recommends surgery to “fix” Callie’s genitals. When Dr. Luce isn’t looking, Callie peeks at her files. She learns that she’s biologically male and that surgery would likely cause her to lose sexual sensation. Horrified, Callie decides he’s a boy, renames himself Cal, and runs away to San Francisco. After mishaps on the road and sleeping in Golden Gate Park, Cal finds work at a peep show that displays people with ambiguous gender. Here, he meets Zora, another intersex person, who teaches him that he’s not alone. In Detroit, Cal’s parents are devastated and desperate to find their child. When the police raid the peep show, Cal calls home and learns that Milton has died in a car accident that occurred when he tried to catch a person who claimed to have kidnapped Callie. This person turns out to be Father Mike, the man Tessie left for Milton years ago. Cal returns home for the funeral but opts to talk with Desdemona instead of attending. Desdemona confesses that she committed incest and apologizes for the gene she and Lefty passed to Cal. Cal tells her he will live a good life. Years later, Cal starts a relationship with a woman named Julie Kikuchi in Berlin."
Evident,"Lawyer Bryan Stevenson gives a first-person account of his decades helping marginalized Americans who have been unfairly and harshly punished by the U.S. criminal justice system, which disproportionately targets people of color and poor people. At the heart of Just Mercy is the story of Walter McMillian, a Black man who was framed for the murder of a girl named Ronda Morrison, convicted, and sent to death row. 
Stevenson alternates chapters about Walter with his personal reflections on our country’s history with racial disparity and issues around incarceration. Stevenson highlights other groups of vulnerable people who have been victimized by the criminal justice system and shares the stories of the prisoners he has helped over the years. The book also follows the growth of Stevenson’s nonprofit law project, the Alabama-based Equal Justice Initiative (EJI), through its expansion from focusing on death row prisoners to helping people sentenced to life without parole. Stevenson chronicles how EJI becomes a significant force in criminal justice reform.
In 1983 as a law student, Stevenson discovers his life’s passion when he interns with the Georgia-based Southern Prisoners Defense Committee and meets his first death row prisoner. After graduation Stevenson accepts a job with the organization to represent poor prisoners, including those in Alabama who lack any public defender. He meets Walter McMillian on Alabama’s death row. Walter owns a successful business but also transgresses racial boundaries when he has an affair with a white woman. Soon after the affair becomes public, the woman’s friend, Ralph Myers, accuses Walter of committing the unsolved murder of Ronda Morrison, which has outraged the community. Law enforcement, including a racist sheriff and the district attorney, eagerly pounces on this accusation, overlooking Walter’s alibi and a lack of evidence. Instead, they actively force Ralph to stick with his story even when he tries to recant. They coerce other false witness testimonies, and—as revealed years later—actively suppress evidence.
After Stevenson and the team at EJI unsuccessfully appeal Walter’s conviction, they launch their own investigation of the crime and uncover new evidence. They find witnesses who can prove the witnesses against Walter lied as well as financial records that indicate that one of these witnesses was paid to give false testimony. Stevenson and his team also petition for and receive all records from Walter’s trial. However, their big break comes when they receive a phone call from Ralph, who now wants to make amends. Ralph admits to lying about Walter and says he was threatened by law enforcement. Stevenson wins a hearing for Walter where he can present his new evidence: Ralph’s testimony, which is confirmed by health care workers and other inmates, as well as recordings of the law enforcement team threatening Ralph if he doesn’t frame Walter. 
While the judge refuses to grant Walter relief, Stevenson continues the appeal process through the Alabama courts. The district attorney asks outside agents to investigate the murder for which Walter was convicted, and the investigators determine that Walter had nothing to do with the crime. Six weeks later, the court invalidates Walter’s conviction. Stevenson and the State file a joint motion to dismiss the charges, and Walter is set free.
Throughout the process, Stevenson and Walter become close friends, and Stevenson helps Walter upon his release, including filing a civil suit on his behalf and offering him a place to stay. Walter works with Stevenson to share his story, giving interviews and speaking at legal conferences, and Walter is even featured in a documentary. Unfortunately, Walter is diagnosed with advancing dementia and is forced to rely on family and eventually a nursing facility for his care. He dies in 2013. Stevenson gives a eulogy at his funeral and shares all he learned from Walter, particularly that we must extend mercy to everyone, even those who have not earned it.
Interspersed with chapters chronicling Walter’s narrative are stories of Stevenson’s other clients and work. His closeness with these prisoners and their horrifying circumstances makes Stevenson more determined to help and causes him to reflect on abstract issues that nevertheless imbue the criminal justice system, like humanity and mercy. Stevenson focuses on several categories of vulnerable people who become trapped in the system, including mentally ill prisoners, disabled prisoners, and poor women who give birth to stillborn babies. 
Stevenson and his team at EJI also become increasingly focused on juvenile offenders who are sometimes tried as adults despite their young age. These offenders may be given de facto death sentences by being sentenced to life without parole and face perilous circumstances when they are housed in adult prisons. Stevenson illustrates how these prisoners retain their own humanity while being forced to live under inhumane conditions. He also discusses some of the qualities common among these types of prisoners: They are generally poor and disproportionately people of color, and most of them lack adequate legal counsel. The juveniles have horrific backgrounds of abuse and neglect.
Stevenson and his team at EJI also work to change the legal system to offer more protection to marginalized people. Several of his cases end up before the U.S. Supreme Court, and he succeeds in winning rulings that ban as unconstitutional the conviction of children to life without parole and the execution of people deemed incompetent from dementia or neurological disease. EJI works to raise public awareness of issues surrounding unfair incarceration, produces groundbreaking reports on racial issues, and sets up programs to help formerly incarcerated people adjust to life on the outside.
Stevenson also reflects on the issues that surround the criminal justice system. His time spent with prisoners awaiting their execution makes him realize how inhumane it is to prepare another human to die. After decades of work, when Stevenson fails to prevent the execution of a man who suffers from an intellectual disability, he momentarily feels unable to continue his work. However, he realizes that he cannot help but be broken by his experiences and comes to understand that it is his own brokenness that allows him to more fully understand the need for mercy and to bring compassion to others. The book ends with Stevenson’s renewed commitment to helping others."
Wills,"The book features two different narrators, both named Will Grayson. The odd-numbered chapters are narrated by a Will Grayson who lives in Evanston, at the northern edge of Chicago. The even-numbered chapters are narrated by a Will Grayson who lives in Naperville, a Chicago suburb. Both Will Graysons are high schoolers. 
The Will Grayson in Evanston (“Evanston Will”) has a best friend named Tiny Cooper. Tiny is described as a large and flamboyant gay man. They have been friends for years. While Tiny has had many boyfriends, Will tries to maintain some distance from most of his peers. Will lives by two rules: 1) “don’t care too much” and 2) “shut up.” Will goes to a rock concert with Tiny and meets Jane, one of Tiny’s friends. He likes Jane, and they share common taste in music. 
The Will Grayson in Naperville (“Naperville Will”) has few friends and suffers from depression. Even though he takes prescription medication, he is still very negative and destructive. He has a close friend, Maura, whom he does not treat very well. She expresses interest in dating him, but he is gay and does not want to tell her (or anyone). He has also been in an online relationship with a boy named Isaac, who lives in Ohio. Will shares everything with Isaac, who is supportive and understanding. Maura confronts Will at the drugstore while he is working and asks him if he is gay. He is rude to her, and their friendship suffers further. He and Isaac plan to meet for the first time, in a week.
Tiny tells Evanston Will that he has written a musical called Tiny Dancer (which is about himself). He wants the student council to fund the production at the school. Jane flirts with Will, and he defaults to his usual emotional avoidance. Will, Tiny, Jane, and their friends Gary and Nick, head into the city to see another concert. Will decides that he might have feelings for Jane, and so he emails the band and asks them to dedicate a song to her. Due to a complication with Will’s fake ID, he is unable to get into the show, and his friends go in without him. While waiting for the concert to finish, Will goes across the street to an adult bookstore, hoping that he will have a funny story to tell his friends afterward. 
Evanston Will feels uncomfortable in the adult bookstore. Naperville Will arrives to the same adult bookstore, as it is where Isaac said they should meet. Naperville Will does not know why Isaac would choose the location but wanders in the store looking for Isaac. When he hears Evanston Will’s name read aloud at the cash register, he is surprised, since it is his name, too. Evanston Will leaves and Naperville Will follows him outside. Eventually, Naperville Will receives a call from Maura. She tells him that Isaac does not exist. She created Isaac’s account and has been talking to Will. She says that it is because he would not tell her of his sexuality. Naperville Will has an emotional breakdown. Evanston Will tries to comfort him but finds the situation very awkward. When Tiny calls, Evanston Will tells Tiny that he should come help.
At Millennium Park, Naperville Will and Tiny discuss all of Will’s problems. They kiss and decide to start dating. Meanwhile, Evanston Will spends time with Maura, who tells him that she ran into an ex-boyfriend. She believes that the ex-boyfriend is responsible for the song that the band dedicated to her. Will does not tell her otherwise.
Naperville Will completely ignores Maura. He and Tiny text and instant-message to communicate and become close quickly. Tiny’s musical gets funding from the student council, but Tiny decides to change the title to Hold Me Closer, and to make the production about love, instead of his own life. Evanston Will is disappointed that Tiny did not tell him that Maura was possibly in a relationship. 
Tiny visits Naperville Will’s home and gets along well with Will’s mother. Will is conscious of how wealthy Tiny’s family is and feels ashamed of his own house. They get along well otherwise and kiss. With the musical in full production, Evanston Will cannot find any of his friends in the lunchroom and instead goes to the auditorium with his tray of food. Once there, he hears Tiny instructing Gary, who is playing a character based on Evanston Will, that he needs to be more pathetic and irritating. Will becomes upset and leaves. He expects that Tiny will chase after him to apologize, but he does not.
Jane visits Evanston Will and tells him that she is no longer with her boyfriend. They kiss. Will invites her in for dinner. Tiny visits Naperville Will, and they get into an argument about how privileged Tiny’s life is and how difficult Naperville Will’s life is. Tiny tries to explain to Will that his life is not easy, and no one appreciates everything that he does. Will lets Tiny leave without apologizing, ending their relationship. 
Naperville Will talks to Maura and apologizes for being a bad friend, while not forgiving her. He then contacts Evanston Will to find out how Tiny is doing. They talk about the musical and how Tiny is very stressed out. Naperville Will comes up with a plan and drives to the musical with his friend Gideon. The musical shows scenes from Tiny’s life, and the songs are well received. At the end of the production, while Tiny is alone in the spotlight and the audience is waiting for the curtain call, Naperville Will yells out to Tiny. He tells Tiny that he appreciates him. Other people in the audience also tell Tiny that they appreciate him, including Jane and Evanston Will."
Up,"Bri Jackson, the narrator of the novel, is a 16-year-old girl from Garden Heights, a predominantly Black inner-city neighborhood. Bri has her sights set on rap stardom, hoping to follow in the footsteps of her late father, the underground rap star Lawless. As the novel opens, Bri is nervously awaiting the phone call that could be her big break: an invitation to perform in the Ring, a local club where up-and-coming rappers face off in “battles.” But first, she must endure her ACT prep class at Midtown School of the Arts so she can get her confiscated phone back from her teacher. Bri’s two best friends from Garden Heights, Sonny and Malik, are in the class with her. Like many of the other students of color at Midtown Academy, they are bused in from less affluent neighborhoods. 
By the time Bri finally gets the call to battle at the Ring, both her teacher and her mother, Jay, have reminded her that school, not rap, is the key to her future. But Bri remains fixated on rap stardom as the solution to her family’s financial problems, especially after she learns that Jay, a recovering drug addict, has lost her job. Bri’s Aunt Pooh, a gang member and a drug dealer, escorts Bri to the battle at the Ring, where she squares off with Milez, another teen rapper. In the first round of the battle, Milez raps about Lawless’s murder, shocking Bri and causing her to freeze up when it is her turn to rap. But she soon recovers and outperforms Milez in the next two rounds, winning the battle decisively. By the following morning, a video of the battle is on YouTube and all Bri’s classmates are praising her for her skills.  
Bri’s celebration is short-lived, however. Tate and Long, two school security guards who have a reputation for targeting Black and Latinx students, single Bri out to have her bag searched. When Bri objects, they violently throw her to the ground and cuff her. Bri is suspended for having candy—which her principal refers to as ""contraband—in her backpack. The security guards are suspended too, pending an investigation, but rumors circulate around the school that Bri is a drug dealer.   
Angry about the assault and people’s racist assumptions about her, Bri writes and records a defiant song called “On the Come Up.” In the song, Bri rails against racist police and other authority figures. She also boasts about having a gun and being ready to use it—because that’s what people expect anyway—even though she barely knows anything about guns. Bri shares the recording with Supreme, her father’s old manager, who promises to make her famous. Supreme releases “On the Come Up” online, where it gets picked up by a Black gossip blog and goes viral. Many of Bri’s friends love the song, but Aunt Pooh, Malik, and Trey all chastise Bri for misrepresenting herself and rapping about gang violence that she has never taken part in.  
Real violence breaks out when Tate and Long are reinstated as the school security guards. Students of color protest outside the school while chanting some of the violent lyrics from “On the Come Up.” When Tate and Long warn them to stop, some students attack the security guards, and a riot ensues. A local news station reports that Bri’s song incited the violence. Jay sees the newscast, learns about Bri’s song for the first time, and insists that Bri stop rapping, lay low, and focus on school. Instead, Bri takes to Instagram and is interviewed by a local radio show, defiantly claiming on both platforms that she won’t be silenced. During the radio interview, Bri has to be restrained after DJ Hype insults her with sexist taunts. Bri begins to feel as though she’s becoming the violent person that others assume she is.  
Meanwhile, Bri’s family continues to struggle, falling behind on bills and rent. The electric company shuts off the power and the landlord threatens eviction. Jay quits school, setting aside her dreams so she can become eligible for food stamps. To make matters worse, the Crowns, a rival gang, rob Bri and Malik at gunpoint, taking her father’s gold chain. Aunt Pooh vows to get revenge on the Crowns and disappears for ten days. When she returns, Aunt Pooh is arrested in a drug bust and taken to jail while Bri looks on.  
With her family’s struggles in mind, Bri goes to a recording studio again, this time with Supreme. Supreme encourages Bri to embrace the persona of a “hoodlum” in her music because that is what people expect of Black rappers. He has another rapper write a song for Bri to record. Even though Bri does not agree with the lyrics, she reluctantly agrees to record the song, hoping to impress a white record executive.  
Bri returns to the Ring once more, where she is supposed to perform the song she recorded. Instead, Bri freestyles her own lyrics about refusing to be what people think she should be. The record executive angrily walks out, but the crowd goes wild. Later, an unnamed celebrity retweets the video of Bri’s freestyle and calls her the future of hip-hop. Bri decides that she will pursue a rap career, but only if she can do it on her own terms."
Kind,"Jing-mei’s mother lost everyone she loved before fleeing China and coming to the United States in search of the American Dream. Her heavy hopes rest solely on the back of her daughter who she believes could be a prodigy if she tries. Initially, mother and daughter share the goal of Jing-mei’s success, and they dream up ways for her to become famous like child actress Shirley Temple. When her mother takes Jing-mei to get her hair done in the fashion of Temple’s famous curls, the makeover is botched, and Jing-mei ends up with a Peter Pan haircut. Her mother projects her disappointment onto her daughter and makes Jing-mei feel like her mangled hair is somehow her own fault. Soon, Jing-mei starts to feel the weight of her mother’s unattainable expectations. She is subjected to nightly aptitude tests inspired by stories of amazing children featured in magazines her mother procures from the houses she cleans. Jing-mei is forced to perform magic tricks, predict the weather, memorize capitals, stand on her head, and more, but with each failed attempt her mother’s face registers disappointment. When Jing-mei looks in the mirror, she doesn’t see herself anymore. Instead, she sees an ordinary, sad, ugly girl.
From then on, Jing-mei is determined to defy her mother’s expectations in order to maintain her own identity. Jing-mei refuses to show interest in her mother’s tests so that her mother will lose hope, and for a little while, she is successful. Then the sight of a Chinese girl playing piano on TV reignites Jing-mei’s mother’s hope. Jing-mei sees the girl as a Chinese Shirley Temple who mirrors the prodigy self she once dreamed of becoming. When her mother critiques the girl’s skill, Jing-mei defends her and protests that at least she is trying. Her mother retorts that Jing-mei could be good at anything but she doesn’t try. To Jing-mei’s dismay, her mother arranges piano lessons with their neighbor, Mr. Chong, in exchange for housecleaning services. Jing-mei cries that she isn’t a genius and accuses her mother of trying to make her into something she isn’t. In response, her mother slaps her and says that she doesn’t want Jing-mei to be a genius; she only wants her to be her best.
Jing-mei quickly realizes that Mr. Chong, nicknamed “Old Chong,” is deaf and has poor sight. He cannot hear the music she plays, and his eyes cannot keep up with her fingers on the keys. She tricks him into thinking she is playing the right notes and therefore finds out how many mistakes she can get away with while being lazy. Although she finds that she has a natural ability for playing the piano, Jing-mei is determined to defy her mother and continue her ruse of attempting to be skillful. A year later, Jing-mei hears Auntie Lindo bragging about her daughter, Waverly, the youngest chess champion in Chinatown. Not to be outdone, Jing-mei’s mother brags about her daughter’s natural talent for the piano even though she hasn’t heard her play. This enrages Jing-mei, and she decides she is going to put an end to her mother’s silly pride. 
Although they are of meager means, Jing-mei’s parents save up their money to buy a secondhand piano for their living room. Then Old Chong and Jing-mei’s mother sign Jing-mei up for the church talent show in order to show off her skill. The piece she is to play in the talent show is called “Pleading Child” and is not particularly difficult. Instead of memorizing the piece, though, Jing-mei daydreams and practices her curtsy to the audience. Jing-mei’s mother invites all of her family and friends to the talent show. Jing-mei is excited and confident that her inner prodigy will emerge and she will play flawlessly. However, when she starts to play, she is shocked by the sounds of wrong notes, and a chill runs through her. When she finishes, she is shaken but hopes that somehow she has only imagined playing incorrect notes. She curtsies, but the audience is silent except for Old Chong’s cheers. Jing-mei feels shame and humiliation, and she can sense these feelings in her parents as well. Instead of leaving, they sit through the rest of the show without speaking a word. Jing-mei hears a child comment that her performance was terrible, and the child’s mother remarks that at least she tried. Jing-mei, however, knows this isn’t true.  
Afterward, the blank look on her mother’s face devastates Jing-mei. Rather than scolding Jing-mei, her mother rides home in silence and shuts herself in her room. Jing-mei is disappointed by her mother’s composed reaction. She’d hoped for the chance to scream at her mother and blame her for her unhappiness. Two days later, to Jing-mei’s surprise, her mother demands she practice again. Her mother drags her to the piano as Jing-mei screams that she will never be the child her mother wanted. Jing-mei’s mother responds that there are only two kinds of daughters: those who are obedient and those who do what they want. She makes it clear that Jing-mei will be the obedient daughter as long as she lives under her roof. Jing-mei boils over and tells her mother that she wishes she was dead like the twins her mother lost in China. This statement breaks her mother, and she silently walks away. She never forces Jing-mei to play the piano again. 
As the years go by and Jing-mei grows up, she counts all the ways she has been a disappointment to her mother and has failed in order to assert control of her own life. The piano remains in her parents’ living room but is never played, and Jing-mei and her mother never speak about the incident again. As an adult, Jing-mei also wonders why her mother ultimately gave up hope. Then, on Jing-mei’s thirtieth birthday, her mother offers her the piano. Jing-mei feels forgiveness and redemption at the offer, but she doesn’t take it. When Jing-mei’s mother dies, Jing-mei goes to her parents’ apartment to handle her possessions for her father. She has the piano reconditioned and searches through her old music books. There, she finds the recital song “Pleading Child” and begins to play it again. On the opposite page, she discovers a song she hadn’t noticed before titled “Perfectly Contented.” She plays both songs, noting their similarities and differences as she finally realizes that they are two halves of the same song."
West,"Saeed and Nadia are young adults living in an unnamed city on the brink of war. Saeed asks Nadia to coffee, and they begin to date. However, between societal rules restricting men and women being in public together and escalating tension between the government and a militant group, they rarely get to see each other. Because Saeed lives with his parents, he sometimes goes to Nadia’s flat, disguising himself as a woman to not cause a scandal. Otherwise, they text frequently. Then, the government cuts off all cellular and Wi-Fi service as a counterterrorism measure, which also cuts Saeed and Nadia off from each other. Saeed searches everywhere for Nadia and finally waits all day at her flat for her to return. He begs her to move in with him and his parents, but Nadia is reluctant. When Saeed’s mother gets killed by stray gunfire, Nadia relents and moves in with Saeed and his father. As the fighting worsens, Saeed and Nadia hear rumors about magical doors that can transport people anywhere in the world. They don’t believe these rumors. 
The militants eventually take the city, imposing strict rules and surveillance. They hold public executions of those who break their religious rules and those who belong to certain religious denominations. Desperate to escape, Saeed and Nadia meet with a man who agrees to secure them passage out of the city via a magical door. He takes their money and agrees to get in contact. When they hear from him again, Saeed’s father announces he will not go with them. He makes Nadia promise to stay with Saeed until Saeed is safe and settled. The next day, Saeed and Nadia pack small backpacks full of supplies and meet the mysterious man at the rendezvous point. He sends them through a door. They emerge on the island of Mykonos, where a large refugee camp has grown. Wealthy countries have also discovered these doors and keep them strictly guarded to try and cut back on the number of refugees in their countries. After a few months, Nadia befriends a local girl who promises to help them leave Mykonos. The girl makes good on her promise and sneaks Saeed and Nadia through a newly discovered door.
They emerge in an empty mansion in London and stay in one of the rooms. Other refugees come to live in the house alongside them. Saeed and Nadia start to feel less in love and become more irritated with each other because of the stress of their ordeal. Some London citizens attack refugees, but others volunteer to bring food and medicine into the occupied houses. The British government cuts the power to the neighborhood. As more refugees enter London, they divide themselves by national origin. Saeed would like to move to another house to be closer to others from their country, but Nadia prefers to stay where they are. Eventually, the British government begins a push to make the migrants leave the houses they’ve occupied. There is a violent siege, but the government finally relents. The government plans to build a halo city on London’s outskirts for the migrants to live in. Saeed and Nadia move to a work camp and build houses so that they can someday earn a forty-meter house of their own. Between exhaustion and their fizzling romance, they fall into a rut. Nadia suggests they move to Marin in California. 
Nadia and Saeed set up a shanty house in Marin. Nadia starts working at a co-op, and Saeed finds solace in a Black-majority religious congregation. Even though they both settle into their new lives, they find themselves changing. Nadia begins to realize that she’s bisexual, and Saeed becomes attracted to the daughter of the preacher at his congregation. Although they still enjoy each other’s company, they begin to feel more like friends than lovers. They don’t want their relationship to sour, and they know they have to separate. One day, Nadia simply packs her things and leaves. She moves into a room at the co-op where she works and later starts dating one of her coworkers. Saeed grows closer to the preacher’s daughter, and they start dating. Although their separation is difficult at first, Saeed and Nadia eventually fall out of touch. Fifty years later, they meet again in a café in the city they once fled from together. Saeed talks about the stars in the Chilean desert and offers to take Nadia someday. They leave not knowing if they’ll ever see each other again."
Framework,"The action covered in Tristram Shandy spans the years 1680-1766. Sterne obscures the story's underlying chronology, however, by rearranging the order of the various pieces of his tale. He also subordinates the basic plot framework by weaving together a number of different stories, as well as such disparate materials as essays, sermons, and legal documents. There are, nevertheless, two clearly discernible narrative lines in the book.
The first is the plot sequence that includes Tristram's conception, birth, christening, and accidental circumcision. (This sequence extends somewhat further in Tristram's treatment of his ""breeching,"" the problem of his education, and his first and second tours of France, but these events are handled less extensively and are not as central to the text.) It takes six volumes to cover this chain of events, although comparatively few pages are spent in actually advancing such a simple plot. The story occurs as a series of accidents, all of which seem calculated to confound Walter Shandy's hopes and expectations for his son. The manner of his conception is the first disaster, followed by the flattening of his nose at birth, a misunderstanding in which he is given the wrong name, and an accidental run-in with a falling window-sash. The catastrophes that befall Tristram are actually relatively trivial; only in the context of Walter Shandy's eccentric, pseudo-scientific theories do they become calamities.
The second major plot consists of the fortunes of Tristram's Uncle Toby. Most of the details of this story are concentrated in the final third of the novel, although they are alluded to and developed in piecemeal fashion from the very beginning. Toby receives a wound to the groin while in the army, and it takes him four years to recover. When he is able to move around again, he retires to the country with the idea of constructing a scaled replica of the scene of the battle in which he was injured. He becomes obsessed with re-enacting those battles, as well as with the whole history and theory of fortification and defense. The Peace of Utrecht slows him down in these ""hobby-horsical"" activities, however, and it is during this lull that he falls under the spell of Widow Wadman. The novel ends with the long-promised account of their unfortunate affair."
Deference,"In Outliers: The Story of Success, Malcolm Gladwell considers the circumstances that lead to success. The first half of the book looks closely at how opportunities matter more in the lives of successful people than hard work or raw talent. The second half of the book focuses on cultural legacies: behavioral tendencies rooted in their ancestral past.
Part One examines the role of opportunity in the lives of extremely successful people. Gladwell’s first example is the Canadian Hockey League, the world’s most competitive youth hockey league. Since the cutoff date for the Canadian leagues that serve the youngest players is January 1, those born in the first part of the calendar year are much larger and more coordinated than their peers. The larger and more coordinated kids are given more playing time and better coaching, and thus become better players by the time they reach the top league. An overwhelming majority of Canadian professional hockey players have birthdays in January, February or March.
Gladwell proposes that 10,000 hours of practice is needed to master a skill, even for prodigies like Mozart. Bill Joy, Bill Gates, and the Beatles all worked hard to achieve success but benefited from opportunities they did not create. Joy, one of the founders of Sun Microsystems, happened to attend one of the first colleges in the world with a time-sharing terminal. In graduate school, he had a terminal in his room, where he spent all of his free time programming. Gates happened to attend a private high school with a time-sharing terminal connected to a mainframe in Seattle. He also was able to spend all of his free time programming. Early on, the Beatles were hired to play long shows day after day in Hamburg, Germany. 
Birth year or era is another form of opportunity. Gates and Joy (as well as other early programmers) all reached the end of their teen years just as personal computers became available to the public. In another example, fourteen of the top seventy-five richest people in the history of the world happened to be alive at the same time, in the same country: the United States in the mid-1800s.
Opportunity matters more than an individual’s IQ. Using a study conducted by Lewis Terman, the creator of the Stanford-Binet IQ test, Gladwell shows that “practical intelligence” is as important as “analytical intelligence.” He also contrasts Chris Langan, one of the world’s smartest living people, with Robert Oppenheimer. While both had difficulties in college, only Oppenheimer had a successful life, due to his practical intelligence.
The last portion of Part One looks at Joe Flom, a successful lawyer from New York City. While he was born into a poor family to Jewish immigrants (in a time when Jewish immigrants were not treated well), many of the disadvantages in his life were actually benefits and directly contributed to his success.
Part Two investigates cultural legacies. Using flight recorder transcripts from several plane crashes from the last few decades, Gladwell shows that cultural expectations and habits can be a severe hindrance to pilots. Copilots from countries that have a high “Power Distance Index” (those that show the most deference to authority) will often avoid telling pilots that they are making mistakes, even when the mistakes are potentially fatal. After recognizing the dangers of such cultural expectations, commercial aviation has instituted programs to change the way flight crews talk with one another. 
Gladwell next analyzes the disparity in public school math test scores between Eastern and Western countries. He suggests that the cultures in which rice paddy farming is historically important have a stronger work ethic. Using various examples, Gladwell shows that hard work has a greater impact on success in learning mathematics than intelligence. 
The final example is an examination of the KIPP school in the South Bronx and the “achievement gap” between socioeconomic groups. American students from middle-class and affluent households retain more information over summer vacation and are more likely to make additional gains than students from low-income households. The KIPP school uses longer school days and summer programming to eliminate the achievement gap for low-income children. While the work schedule is very rigorous, the school’s students go on to great academic success.
Gladwell demonstrates that if more opportunities were available, there would be far more successful people and the world would be richer for it."
Disciplined,"Lawyer Bryan Stevenson gives a first-person account of his decades helping marginalized Americans who have been unfairly and harshly punished by the U.S. criminal justice system, which disproportionately targets people of color and poor people. At the heart of Just Mercy is the story of Walter McMillian, a Black man who was framed for the murder of a girl named Ronda Morrison, convicted, and sent to death row. 
Stevenson alternates chapters about Walter with his personal reflections on our country’s history with racial disparity and issues around incarceration. Stevenson highlights other groups of vulnerable people who have been victimized by the criminal justice system and shares the stories of the prisoners he has helped over the years. The book also follows the growth of Stevenson’s nonprofit law project, the Alabama-based Equal Justice Initiative (EJI), through its expansion from focusing on death row prisoners to helping people sentenced to life without parole. Stevenson chronicles how EJI becomes a significant force in criminal justice reform.
In 1983 as a law student, Stevenson discovers his life’s passion when he interns with the Georgia-based Southern Prisoners Defense Committee and meets his first death row prisoner. After graduation Stevenson accepts a job with the organization to represent poor prisoners, including those in Alabama who lack any public defender. He meets Walter McMillian on Alabama’s death row. Walter owns a successful business but also transgresses racial boundaries when he has an affair with a white woman. Soon after the affair becomes public, the woman’s friend, Ralph Myers, accuses Walter of committing the unsolved murder of Ronda Morrison, which has outraged the community. Law enforcement, including a racist sheriff and the district attorney, eagerly pounces on this accusation, overlooking Walter’s alibi and a lack of evidence. Instead, they actively force Ralph to stick with his story even when he tries to recant. They coerce other false witness testimonies, and—as revealed years later—actively suppress evidence.
After Stevenson and the team at EJI unsuccessfully appeal Walter’s conviction, they launch their own investigation of the crime and uncover new evidence. They find witnesses who can prove the witnesses against Walter lied as well as financial records that indicate that one of these witnesses was paid to give false testimony. Stevenson and his team also petition for and receive all records from Walter’s trial. However, their big break comes when they receive a phone call from Ralph, who now wants to make amends. Ralph admits to lying about Walter and says he was threatened by law enforcement. Stevenson wins a hearing for Walter where he can present his new evidence: Ralph’s testimony, which is confirmed by health care workers and other inmates, as well as recordings of the law enforcement team threatening Ralph if he doesn’t frame Walter. 
While the judge refuses to grant Walter relief, Stevenson continues the appeal process through the Alabama courts. The district attorney asks outside agents to investigate the murder for which Walter was convicted, and the investigators determine that Walter had nothing to do with the crime. Six weeks later, the court invalidates Walter’s conviction. Stevenson and the State file a joint motion to dismiss the charges, and Walter is set free.
Throughout the process, Stevenson and Walter become close friends, and Stevenson helps Walter upon his release, including filing a civil suit on his behalf and offering him a place to stay. Walter works with Stevenson to share his story, giving interviews and speaking at legal conferences, and Walter is even featured in a documentary. Unfortunately, Walter is diagnosed with advancing dementia and is forced to rely on family and eventually a nursing facility for his care. He dies in 2013. Stevenson gives a eulogy at his funeral and shares all he learned from Walter, particularly that we must extend mercy to everyone, even those who have not earned it.
Interspersed with chapters chronicling Walter’s narrative are stories of Stevenson’s other clients and work. His closeness with these prisoners and their horrifying circumstances makes Stevenson more determined to help and causes him to reflect on abstract issues that nevertheless imbue the criminal justice system, like humanity and mercy. Stevenson focuses on several categories of vulnerable people who become trapped in the system, including mentally ill prisoners, disabled prisoners, and poor women who give birth to stillborn babies. 
Stevenson and his team at EJI also become increasingly focused on juvenile offenders who are sometimes tried as adults despite their young age. These offenders may be given de facto death sentences by being sentenced to life without parole and face perilous circumstances when they are housed in adult prisons. Stevenson illustrates how these prisoners retain their own humanity while being forced to live under inhumane conditions. He also discusses some of the qualities common among these types of prisoners: They are generally poor and disproportionately people of color, and most of them lack adequate legal counsel. The juveniles have horrific backgrounds of abuse and neglect.
Stevenson and his team at EJI also work to change the legal system to offer more protection to marginalized people. Several of his cases end up before the U.S. Supreme Court, and he succeeds in winning rulings that ban as unconstitutional the conviction of children to life without parole and the execution of people deemed incompetent from dementia or neurological disease. EJI works to raise public awareness of issues surrounding unfair incarceration, produces groundbreaking reports on racial issues, and sets up programs to help formerly incarcerated people adjust to life on the outside.
Stevenson also reflects on the issues that surround the criminal justice system. His time spent with prisoners awaiting their execution makes him realize how inhumane it is to prepare another human to die. After decades of work, when Stevenson fails to prevent the execution of a man who suffers from an intellectual disability, he momentarily feels unable to continue his work. However, he realizes that he cannot help but be broken by his experiences and comes to understand that it is his own brokenness that allows him to more fully understand the need for mercy and to bring compassion to others. The book ends with Stevenson’s renewed commitment to helping others."
Appoint,"Stephen Dedalus spends the early morning hours of June 16, 1904, remaining aloof from his mocking friend, Buck Mulligan, and Buck’s English acquaintance, Haines. As Stephen leaves for work, Buck orders him to leave the house key and meet them at the pub at 12:30. Stephen resents Buck.
	Around 10:00 A.M., Stephen teaches a history lesson to his class at Garrett Deasy’s boys’ school. After class, Stephen meets with Deasy to receive his wages. The narrow-minded and prejudiced Deasy lectures Stephen on life. Stephen agrees to take Deasy’s editorial letter about cattle disease to acquaintances at the newspaper. 
	Stephen spends the remainder of his morning walking alone on Sandymount Strand, thinking critically about his younger self and about perception. He composes a poem in his head and writes it down on a scrap torn from Deasy’s letter. 
	At 8:00 A.M. the same morning, Leopold Bloom fixes breakfast and brings his wife her mail and breakfast in bed. One of her letters is from Molly’s concert tour manager, Blazes Boylan (Bloom suspects he is also Molly’s lover)—Boylan will visit at 4:00 this afternoon. Bloom returns downstairs, reads a letter from their daughter, Milly, then goes to the outhouse. 
	At 10:00 A.M., Bloom picks up an amorous letter from the post office—he is corresponding with a woman named Martha Clifford under the pseudonym Henry Flower. He reads the tepid letter, ducks briefly into a church, then orders Molly’s lotion from the pharmacist. He runs into Bantam Lyons, who mistakenly gets the impression that Bloom is giving him a tip on the horse Throwaway in the afternoon’s Gold Cup race.
	Around 11:00 A.M., Bloom rides with Simon Dedalus (Stephen’s father), Martin Cunningham, and Jack Power to the funeral of Paddy Dignam. The men treat Bloom as somewhat of an outsider. At the funeral, Bloom thinks about the deaths of his son and his father.
	At noon, we find Bloom at the offices of the Freeman newspaper, negotiating an advertisement for Keyes, a liquor merchant. Several idle men, including editor Myles Crawford, are hanging around in the office, discussing political speeches. Bloom leaves to secure the ad. Stephen arrives at the newspaper with Deasy’s letter. Stephen and the other men leave for the pub just as Bloom is returning. Bloom’s ad negotiation is rejected by Crawford on his way out.
	At 1:00 P.M., Bloom runs into Josie Breen, an old flame, and they discuss Mina Purefoy, who is in labor at the maternity hospital. Bloom stops in Burton’s restaurant, but he decides to move on to Davy Byrne’s for a light lunch. Bloom reminisces about an intimate afternoon with Molly on Howth. Bloom leaves and is walking toward the National Library when he spots Boylan on the street and ducks into the National Museum.
	At 2:00 P.M., Stephen is informally presenting his “Hamlet theory” in the National Library to the poet A.E. and the librarians John Eglinton, Best, and Lyster. A.E. is dismissive of Stephen’s theory and leaves. Buck enters and jokingly scolds Stephen for failing to meet him and Haines at the pub. On the way out, Buck and Stephen pass Bloom, who has come to obtain a copy of Keyes’ ad.
	At 4:00 P.M., Simon Dedalus, Ben Dollard, Lenehan, and Blazes Boylan converge at the Ormond Hotel bar. Bloom notices Boylan’s car outside and decides to watch him. Boylan soon leaves for his appointment with Molly, and Bloom sits morosely in the Ormond restaurant—he is briefly mollified by Dedalus’s and Dollard’s singing. Bloom writes back to Martha, then leaves to post the letter.
	At 5:00 P.M., Bloom arrives at Barney Kiernan’s pub to meet Martin Cunningham about the Dignam family finances, but Cunningham has not yet arrived. The citizen, a belligerent Irish nationalist, becomes increasingly drunk and begins attacking Bloom’s Jewishness. Bloom stands up to the citizen, speaking in favor of peace and love over xenophobic violence. Bloom and the citizen have an altercation on the street before Cunningham’s carriage carries Bloom away.
	Bloom relaxes on Sandymount Strand around sunset, after his visit to Mrs. Dignam’s house nearby. A young woman, Gerty MacDowell, notices Bloom watching her from across the beach. Gerty subtly reveals more and more of her legs while Bloom surreptitiously masturbates. Gerty leaves, and Bloom dozes. 
	At 10:00 P.M., Bloom wanders to the maternity hospital to check on Mina Purefoy. Also at the hospital are Stephen and several of his medi-c-al student friends, drinking and talking boisterously about subjects related to birth. Bloom agrees to join them, though he privately disapproves of their revelry in light of Mrs. Purefoy’s struggles upstairs. Buck arrives, and the men proceed to Burke’s pub. At closing time, Stephen convinces his friend Lynch to go to the brothel section of town and Bloom follows, feeling protective.
	Bloom finally locates Stephen and Lynch at Bella Cohen’s brothel. Stephen is drunk and imagines that he sees the ghost of his mother—full of rage, he shatters a lamp with his walking stick. Bloom runs after Stephen and finds him in an argument with a British soldier who knocks him out.
	Bloom revives Stephen and takes him for coffee at a cabman’s shelter to sober up. Bloom invites Stephen back to his house.
	Well after midnight, Stephen and Bloom arrive back at Bloom’s house. They drink cocoa and talk about their respective backgrounds. Bloom asks Stephen to stay the night. Stephen politely refuses. Bloom sees him out and comes back in to find evidence of Boylan’s visit. Still, Bloom is at peace with the world and he climbs into bed, tells Molly of his day and requests breakfast in bed. 
After Bloom falls asleep, Molly remains awake, surprised by Bloom’s request for breakfast in bed. Her mind wanders to her childhood in Gibraltar, her afternoon of sex with Boylan, her singing career, Stephen Dedalus. Her thoughts of Bloom vary wildly over the course of the monologue, but it ends with a reminiscence of their intimate moment at Howth and a positive affirmation."
Verdict,"An ambitious, worldly young bank official named Joseph K. is arrested by two warders ""one fine morning,"" although he has done nothing wrong. K. is indignant and outraged. The morning happens to be that of his thirtieth birthday. One year later, on the morning of his thirty-first birthday, two warders again come for K. They take him to a quarry outside of town and kill him in the name of the Law. K. lets them.

The Trial is the chronicle of that intervening year of K.'s case, his struggles and encounters with the invisible Law and the untouchable Court. It is an account, ultimately, of state-induced self-destruction. Yet, as in all of Kafka's best writing, the ""meaning"" is far from clear. Just as the parable related by the chaplain in Chapter Nine (called ""The Doorkeeper"" or ""Before the Law"") elicits endless commentary from students of the Law, so has The Trial been a touchstone of twentieth-century critical interpretation. As some commentators have noted, it has, in parts, the quality of revealed truth; as such it is ultimately unresolvable--a mirror for any sectarian reading.
How to summarize this kind of text? It was written during 1914-1915, while Kafka was an official in the Workmen's Accident Insurance Institute for the Kingdom of Bohemia. On one level we can see in The Trial a satirical pillorying of the Austro-Hungarian bureaucracy of Kafka's day. Yet to many readers it is eerily prescient of the psychological weaponry used by the much more insidious totalitarian regimes to come, of the legally-sanctioned death machines Kafka never lived to see. It is also an unfinished novel, and this is apparent in the final chapters. It is at times as suffocating to read as the airless rooms of the Court that it describes. The German title, Der Prozess, connotes both a ""trial"" and a ""process,"" and it is perhaps this maddening feeling of inevitability that leaves a lasting visceral impression: the machinery has been set in motion, and the process will grind toward conclusion despite our most desperate exhortations."
Indebtedness,"The Tragedy of Pudd'nhead Wilson juggles three plot lines, which all come together in a murder trial at the novel's end. Pudd'nhead Wilson is a Northerner who comes to the small Missouri town of Dawson's Landing to build a career as a lawyer. Immediately upon his arrival he alienates the townspeople, who don't understand his wit. They give him the nickname ""Pudd'nhead"" and refuse to give him their legal work. He scrapes by on odd work and spends most of his time dabbling in scientific hobbies, most notably, fingerprinting.
Roxana, or Roxy, is a beautiful slave who can pass for white, though she is one-sixteenth Black. To save her infant son from ever being sold away from her, she switches him with the child of her white master, who looks just like her son and was born on the same day. Her son Chambers, now called ""Tom,"" grows up as a white man and heir to an estate. Her master's child, Tom, now called ""Chambers"", grows up a slave. ""Tom"" grows into a cruel, cowardly man. His gambling debts lead him, under Roxy's guidance, to rob houses, sell the now-freed Roxy as a slave, and finally to murder his uncle, Judge Driscoll, in a botched robbery attempt.
Luigi and Angelo are former sideshow performers. Good-looking and charming, they claim to be Italian twins, heirs of a deposed nobleman. They arrive in Dawson's Landing to rent a room in Widow Cooper's house, claiming they are tired of the bustle of the world. Luigi confesses to Pudd'nhead Wilson, who has read his palm, that he once killed a man who tried to steal a fabulous Indian knife from the brothers. This knife is stolen by ""Tom"" and used to kill Judge Driscoll. Luigi gets into an argument with ""Tom,"" who has him arrested. The judge is mortified that ""Tom"" has compromised the family honor by doing that, and he instead challenges Luigi to a duel. No one is killed, but ""Tom,"" to save his own reputation, tells his uncle that Luigi is a confessed assassin and therefore not an honorable man to duel. The twins, initially popular in the town, lose their reputation through the judge's claims against them, and lose in an election for city offices in which Pudd'nhead Wilson is elected mayor. Shortly after the election, ""Tom,"" badly in debt and needing money to pay off the man to whom he has fraudulently sold Roxy, murders the judge with the twins' knife while he is robbing him.
""Tom"" escapes disguised as a woman after killing his uncle. The twins, out for a walk, hear the judge's cries and rush to help. They are found standing over the body and their bloody knife is on the floor. They are brought to trial for the murder. Pudd'nhead Wilson, who is their attorney, through his fingerprint collection and a few lucky accidents, discovers that ""Tom"" is the murderer and that he is not the real Tom but Chambers. The twins are redeemed and freed, but soon leave for Europe. ""Tom"" is thrown in jail and then, since it is now known he is a slave, sold ""down the river"" to pay debts from the estate of the real Tom's father. ""Chambers,"" revealed to be Tom, is given back his place as a white man and heir, but, raised as a Black man and marked by his Black speech patterns, he now fits into society nowhere. Pudd'nhead is mayor of Dawson's Landing and finally a success as a lawyer, but none of his old friends are around anymore to enjoy his success with him."
Xon,"Lawyer Bryan Stevenson gives a first-person account of his decades helping marginalized Americans who have been unfairly and harshly punished by the U.S. criminal justice system, which disproportionately targets people of color and poor people. At the heart of Just Mercy is the story of Walter McMillian, a Black man who was framed for the murder of a girl named Ronda Morrison, convicted, and sent to death row. 
Stevenson alternates chapters about Walter with his personal reflections on our country’s history with racial disparity and issues around incarceration. Stevenson highlights other groups of vulnerable people who have been victimized by the criminal justice system and shares the stories of the prisoners he has helped over the years. The book also follows the growth of Stevenson’s nonprofit law project, the Alabama-based Equal Justice Initiative (EJI), through its expansion from focusing on death row prisoners to helping people sentenced to life without parole. Stevenson chronicles how EJI becomes a significant force in criminal justice reform.
In 1983 as a law student, Stevenson discovers his life’s passion when he interns with the Georgia-based Southern Prisoners Defense Committee and meets his first death row prisoner. After graduation Stevenson accepts a job with the organization to represent poor prisoners, including those in Alabama who lack any public defender. He meets Walter McMillian on Alabama’s death row. Walter owns a successful business but also transgresses racial boundaries when he has an affair with a white woman. Soon after the affair becomes public, the woman’s friend, Ralph Myers, accuses Walter of committing the unsolved murder of Ronda Morrison, which has outraged the community. Law enforcement, including a racist sheriff and the district attorney, eagerly pounces on this accusation, overlooking Walter’s alibi and a lack of evidence. Instead, they actively force Ralph to stick with his story even when he tries to recant. They coerce other false witness testimonies, and—as revealed years later—actively suppress evidence.
After Stevenson and the team at EJI unsuccessfully appeal Walter’s conviction, they launch their own investigation of the crime and uncover new evidence. They find witnesses who can prove the witnesses against Walter lied as well as financial records that indicate that one of these witnesses was paid to give false testimony. Stevenson and his team also petition for and receive all records from Walter’s trial. However, their big break comes when they receive a phone call from Ralph, who now wants to make amends. Ralph admits to lying about Walter and says he was threatened by law enforcement. Stevenson wins a hearing for Walter where he can present his new evidence: Ralph’s testimony, which is confirmed by health care workers and other inmates, as well as recordings of the law enforcement team threatening Ralph if he doesn’t frame Walter. 
While the judge refuses to grant Walter relief, Stevenson continues the appeal process through the Alabama courts. The district attorney asks outside agents to investigate the murder for which Walter was convicted, and the investigators determine that Walter had nothing to do with the crime. Six weeks later, the court invalidates Walter’s conviction. Stevenson and the State file a joint motion to dismiss the charges, and Walter is set free.
Throughout the process, Stevenson and Walter become close friends, and Stevenson helps Walter upon his release, including filing a civil suit on his behalf and offering him a place to stay. Walter works with Stevenson to share his story, giving interviews and speaking at legal conferences, and Walter is even featured in a documentary. Unfortunately, Walter is diagnosed with advancing dementia and is forced to rely on family and eventually a nursing facility for his care. He dies in 2013. Stevenson gives a eulogy at his funeral and shares all he learned from Walter, particularly that we must extend mercy to everyone, even those who have not earned it.
Interspersed with chapters chronicling Walter’s narrative are stories of Stevenson’s other clients and work. His closeness with these prisoners and their horrifying circumstances makes Stevenson more determined to help and causes him to reflect on abstract issues that nevertheless imbue the criminal justice system, like humanity and mercy. Stevenson focuses on several categories of vulnerable people who become trapped in the system, including mentally ill prisoners, disabled prisoners, and poor women who give birth to stillborn babies. 
Stevenson and his team at EJI also become increasingly focused on juvenile offenders who are sometimes tried as adults despite their young age. These offenders may be given de facto death sentences by being sentenced to life without parole and face perilous circumstances when they are housed in adult prisons. Stevenson illustrates how these prisoners retain their own humanity while being forced to live under inhumane conditions. He also discusses some of the qualities common among these types of prisoners: They are generally poor and disproportionately people of color, and most of them lack adequate legal counsel. The juveniles have horrific backgrounds of abuse and neglect.
Stevenson and his team at EJI also work to change the legal system to offer more protection to marginalized people. Several of his cases end up before the U.S. Supreme Court, and he succeeds in winning rulings that ban as unconstitutional the conviction of children to life without parole and the execution of people deemed incompetent from dementia or neurological disease. EJI works to raise public awareness of issues surrounding unfair incarceration, produces groundbreaking reports on racial issues, and sets up programs to help formerly incarcerated people adjust to life on the outside.
Stevenson also reflects on the issues that surround the criminal justice system. His time spent with prisoners awaiting their execution makes him realize how inhumane it is to prepare another human to die. After decades of work, when Stevenson fails to prevent the execution of a man who suffers from an intellectual disability, he momentarily feels unable to continue his work. However, he realizes that he cannot help but be broken by his experiences and comes to understand that it is his own brokenness that allows him to more fully understand the need for mercy and to bring compassion to others. The book ends with Stevenson’s renewed commitment to helping others."
Again,"Rashad and Quinn are both students at Springfield Central High School. They have some friends in common but have never interacted with each other. Rashad is Black, and his father has told him throughout his life about the importance of discipline for young Black men. Rashad’s father joined the army and then the police force before retiring and often tells Rashad that the army is the best opportunity for a Black man to succeed in the United States. Because of this, Rashad is part of the Reserve Officer Training Corps, or ROTC. However, Rashad would rather spend his time drawing and hanging out with his friends English, Shannon, and Carlos. 
Quinn is white, and his father died in Afghanistan. Quinn lives with his mother and his younger brother, Willy, and resents that people expect him to live up to the memory of his father. Quinn’s best friends are Dwyer and Guzzo, who lives across the street. Guzzo’s brother, Paul Galluzzo, is a police officer and has acted as a father figure to Quinn ever since Quinn’s father died. Quinn, Dwyer, and Guzzo are on the basketball team together, along with English.
One Friday, Rashad and Quinn are each planning on going to a party with their friends at Guzzo and Paul’s cousin Jill’s house. Quinn has a crush on Jill. On the way to the party, Rashad stops at Jerry’s Corner Mart to pick up some chips and gum. Jerry’s is always monitored by a police officer as a response to shoplifting incidents at the store. While Rashad is picking out chips, he goes to text his brother, Spoony. His phone is in his bag, so he puts it on the floor and kneels down to take the phone out. While he is kneeling, a woman who was standing behind him backs up and trips over him, causing them both to fall over and Rashad’s chips to slide up the aisle. 
The police officer on duty comes over and asks what happened but assumes Rashad was trying to steal before Rashad or the woman can explain. The police officer drags Rashad outside, handcuffs him, throws him to the ground, and begins beating him. Meanwhile, Quinn and his friends have been waiting in the alley next to Jerry’s to ask an adult to buy them beer that they can take to the party. When Quinn goes around to the front of Jerry’s, he sees what the police officer is doing to Rashad. He recognizes the police officer as Paul Galluzzo. He tells his friends to run and, when they are far enough away, explains what happened and tells Guzzo that he saw his brother. The three decide to go to the party and try to forget about it.
Over the weekend, Rashad wakes up in the hospital with a broken nose and ribs and is told he needs to stay there so the doctors can monitor his internal bleeding. Rashad’s father questions whether Rashad was presenting himself in a way that made him seem dangerous, while Spoony is outraged at the situation. The local news obtains footage of Paul beating Rashad and begins covering the story. The Galluzzo family decides to have a cookout on Sunday, which Quinn and Jill both find strange. Quinn and Jill talk at the cookout about what Paul did to Rashad, while Paul and Guzzo try to intimidate Quinn into not saying anything about what he saw.
At school that week, everyone is talking about what happened to Rashad. Quinn feels conflicted as he has only ever seen the good side of Paul and doesn’t know Rashad. On Tuesday, someone has painted graffiti on the sidewalk in front of the school that says, “Rashad is absent again today.” This message creates a division in the school between those who believe Rashad was innocent and those who believe Paul was just doing his job. When Rashad sees a picture of the graffiti, he knows it is Carlos’s work. 
Spoony and his girlfriend, Berry, plan a protest that coming Friday against the police department. Guzzo continues to question Quinn’s loyalty. At first, Quinn wants to believe that Paul was just trying to do his job, but he just can’t forget what he saw outside Jerry’s. On Thursday, Quinn wears a shirt to school that says, “I’m marching. Are you?” The coach of the basketball team tells the players not to go to the protest and tells Quinn he will call his mother to tell her about his shirt. Quinn’s mother confronts him about the protest, and Quinn says he is standing up for what he believes in, just as his father would have done.
The doctor releases Rashad from the hospital on Thursday, and Rashad plans on joining the protest the following day. On Friday morning, Rashad and Quinn both feel nervous about the protest. Quinn sees a tank-like police vehicle headed toward the school and worries about the protesters’ safety. However, after talking with Jill, he understands that Black people live in fear of police violence every day and that they should put themselves at risk for one day to speak out against this reality. Rashad and Quinn, along with an enormous crowd, march from Jerry’s Corner Mart to the police department, where they stage a die-in as Berry reads aloud the names of unarmed Black people killed by police officers. Rashad and Quinn notice each other during the die-in and feel a connection as they both think of the people on the list and how they will keep fighting for them."
Superior,"The protagonist, who is named Tim O’Brien, begins by describing an event that occurred in the middle of his Vietnam experience. “The Things They Carried” catalogs the variety of things his fellow soldiers in the Alpha Company brought on their missions. Several of these things are intangible, including guilt and fear, while others are specific physical objects, including matches, morphine, M-16 rifles, and M&M’s candy.
Throughout the collection, the same characters reappear in various stories. The first member of the Alpha Company to die is Ted Lavender, a “grunt,” or low-ranking soldier, who deals with his anxiety about the war by taking tranquilizers and smoking marijuana. Lavender is shot in the head on his way back from going to the bathroom, and his superior, Lieutenant Jimmy Cross, blames himself for the tragedy. When Lavender is shot, Cross is distracting himself with thoughts of Martha, a college crush. It is revealed in “Love” that Cross’s feelings for Martha, whom he dated once before leaving for Vietnam, were never reciprocated, and that even twenty years after the war, his guilt over Lavender’s death remains.
In “On the Rainy River,” the narrator, O’Brien, explains the series of events that led him to Vietnam in the first place. He receives his draft notice in June of 1968, and his feelings of confusion drive him north to the Canadian border, which he contemplates crossing so that he will not be forced to fight in a war in which he doesn’t believe. Sitting in a rowboat with the proprietor of the Tip Top Lodge, where he stays, O’Brien decides that his guilt about avoiding the war and fear of disappointing his family are more important than his political convictions. He soon leaves, going first back home to Worthington, Minnesota and later to Vietnam.
In addition to Ted Lavender, a few other members of the Alpha Company are killed during their mission overseas, including Curt Lemon, who is killed when he steps on a rigged mortar round. Though O’Brien is not close to Lemon, in “The Dentist,” he tells a story of how Lemon, who faints before a routine checkup with an army-issued dentist, tries to save face by insisting that a perfectly good tooth be pulled. Lee Strunk, another member of the company, dies from injuries he sustains by stepping on a landmine. In “Friends,” O’Brien remembers that before Strunk was fatally hurt, Strunk and Dave Jensen had made a pact that if either man were irreparably harmed, the other man would see that he was quickly killed. However, when Strunk is actually hurt, he begs Jensen to spare him, and Jensen complies. Instead of being upset by the news of his friend’s swift death en route to treatment, Jensen is relieved.
The death that receives the most attention in The Things They Carried is that of Kiowa, a much-loved member of the Alpha Company and one of O’Brien’s closest friends. In “Speaking of Courage,” the story of Kiowa’s death is relayed in retrospect through the memory of Norman Bowker, years after the war. As Bowker drives around a lake in his Iowa hometown, he thinks that he failed to save Kiowa, who was killed when a mortar round hit and caused him to sink headfirst into a marshy field. O’Brien realizes that he has dealt with his guilt over Kiowa’s death differently than Norman Bowker in “Notes.” Just before the end of the war, O’Brien receives a long letter from Bowker that says he hasn’t found a way to make life meaningful after the war. O’Brien resolves to tell Bowker’s story, and the story of Kiowa’s death, in order to negotiate his own feelings of guilt and hollowness.
Like “Love” and “Notes,” several of O’Brien’s stories are told from a perspective twenty years after the Vietnam War, when he is a forty-three-year-old writer living in Massachusetts. Exposure to the guilt of old friends like Jimmy Cross and Norman Bowker prompts him to write stories in order to understand what they were going through. But two stories, “The Man I Killed” and “Ambush,” are written so that O’Brien can confront his own guilt over killing a man with a grenade outside the village of My Khe. In “The Man I Killed,” O’Brien imagines the life of his victim, from his childhood to the way things would have turned out for him had O’Brien not spotted him on a path and thrown a grenade at his feet. In “Ambush,” O’Brien imagines how he might relay the story of the man he killed to his nine-year-old daughter, Kathleen. In this second story, O’Brien provides more details of the actual killing—including the sound of the grenade and his own feelings—and explains that even well after the fact, he hasn’t finished sorting out the experience.
In the last story, “The Lives of the Dead,” O’Brien gives another twist to his contention that stories have the power to save people. In the stories of Curt Lemon and Kiowa, O’Brien explains that his imagination allowed him to grapple successfully with his guilt and confusion over the death of his fourth-grade first love, Linda."
Restoring,"Regeneration begins with Siegfried Sassoon's open letter, dated July 1917, protesting the conduct and insincerities of the First World War. The letter has been published in the London Times and has received much attention in England, as many people are upset over the length and toll of the war thus far. The army is not sure what to do with Sassoon, as his letter clearly threatens to undermine the strength of the war effort at home.
With the string-pulling and guidance of Robert Graves, a fellow poet and friend of Sassoon, the Board agrees to send Sassoon to Craiglockhart War Hospital—a mental facility in Scotland—rather than court-marshaling him. Sassoon is at first hesitant to agree to this, since he (rightly) fears that being committed to a mental hospital will undermine his cause; however, convinced by Graves that there is no other option, Sassoon agrees.
At Craiglockhart, Sassoon meets with Dr. W.H.R. Rivers, a former anthropologist turned psychiatrist who encourages his patients to express their war memories so that they can heal their ""nerves."" Though Rivers can sympathize with the strong dislike of the horrors of war, he believes it is his duty to encourage Sassoon to return to France to fight.
There are many soldiers with various problems and ailments in the hospital. Burns, an emaciated man, has been unable to eat since a shell threw him into the gas-filled stomach of a German corpse. Anderson, a former war surgeon, is now terrified at the sight of blood, and is worried about resuming his civilian medical practice. Prior, a young, stubborn, and slightly difficult patient, enters the hospital suffering from mutism. Rivers meets with each of them in turn, helping them to recover from their problems.
One stormy night, Burns leaves the hospital, makes a trip far into the countryside, and comes across a tree with dead animals hanging from it. He is at first frightened, but he then starts removing the animals from the branches one by one and arranging them in a circle. Burns lies down in the middle of the circle, naked, and he feels soothed. Eventually, Burns returns to the hospital, but no one finds out about this episode.
Dr. Rivers is personally and emotionally tied to the welfare of his patients. One night, he has a nightmare about old nerve regeneration experiments he used to conduct with his old friend, Henry Head. At Cambridge, the two had severed a nerve in Head's hand with the purpose of charting its gradual regeneration. Rivers still feels guilty about the pain he inflicted on his friend, as well as the pain he inflicts on his patients by forcing them to talk about their war experiences.
Sassoon's letter is read in the House of Commons and is dismissed, as he is considered mentally unstable. Though Sassoon expected this result, he is still saddened and disappointed by the news. Slowly, he begins to become friends with another patient in the hospital, Wilfred Owen. Owen is also a poet and he greatly respects Sassoon's work; Sassoon agrees to help Owen with his poetry.
Prior, who has regained his voice, finds his way to a pub in Edinburgh where he meets a young munitions worker named Sarah Lumb. They strike up an acquaintance and agree to see each other again. When Prior returns to the hospital, Rivers tries hypnosis on Prior to see if it enables him to remember the tragic events that led to his breakdown. The hypnosis works, and Prior remembers in vivid detail having to shovel his men's remains after they were killed by a shell. Prior's memories anger and upset him. The next week, Prior takes Sarah to a seaside town where they see crowds of people walking on the beach. Prior envies and resents the way these people can just escape from the war. A storm comes, and Prior and Sarah make love under the shelter of a thornbush.
After a very busy day, Rivers wakes up in the middle of the night with chest pain; his doctor insists that he take three weeks vacation. During these three weeks, he visits his brother's house and reflects on his relationship with his deceased father. Rivers then visits his old friend Henry Head, who offers him a terrific job at a war hospital in London. Finally Rivers visits Burns's house in Suffolk for a few days. The Review Board has given Burns an unconditional discharge from the army. While at Suffolk, Burns has an episode and tries to commit suicide by hiding in a hole that floods at high tide. Rivers finds Burns, however, and saves him.
Back at Craiglockhart, the Board has granted Prior permanent home service; he will not have to return to the war. Prior sneaks into Sarah's room and tells her the news. Though they are both skeptical about love, they agree to give their relationship a try. Meanwhile, Sassoon has also come to a very important decision. Although he still disagrees with the brutality and suffering of the war, he decides to return to France in order to care for his men. Both Graves and Rivers are pleased with this decision.
Dr. Rivers decides to take the job in London, and leaves Craiglockhart in glory (Willard, one of his patients, has overcome his mental block and is now able to walk again). In London, Rivers is fascinated by his new work. Dr. Yealland, another psychiatrist specializing in war patients, invites Rivers to the National Hospital to come on his rounds. Rivers watches one of Yealland's horrific electro-shock therapy sessions on a patient named Callan. That night, Rivers has a nightmare that he is shoving a horse's bit into Sassoon's mouth, similar to the way Yealland shoved the electrode into the patient's mouth.
Rivers returns to Craiglockhart for a monthly Review Board meeting. The Board grants Anderson a desk position in the War Office and discharges Sassoon to duty, to return to France to fight. As Rivers says farewell to Sassoon, he realizes how much his own views about the war have changed."
Station,"In an event called “the collapse,” a deadly flu epidemic sweeps the globe and kills most of the world’s population. The plot of Station Eleven revolves around a few main characters and offers glimpses into their lives both before the collapse and during the nineteen years that follow. Chapters often jump forward or backward in time, and shift focus and perspective from one character to another.
Arthur Leander is born on an island off the west coast of Canada. Dreaming of a more exciting life, he moves to Toronto, where he meets Clark Thompson, who becomes his closest friend. Arthur pursues an acting career, eventually becoming a very successful stage and screen actor. In Toronto, he meets a young woman named Miranda Carroll, an aspiring artist who grew up on the same island as Arthur. The two eventually marry.
Arthur and Miranda celebrate their third wedding anniversary with a dinner party at their Hollywood Hills home that Clark attends. During the party, Miranda realizes that she dislikes Arthur’s shallow movie-industry friends, and she also discovers that Arthur is romantically involved with Elizabeth Colton, one of the party guests. Elizabeth drinks too much and passes out on the couch, and the other guests go home. Miranda stays up late working on her comic book, Dr. Eleven. She goes outside and talks to one of the paparazzi stationed across the street. The man, Jeevan Chaudhary, takes an unflattering picture of her.
Jeevan does not like being a paparazzo and instead becomes an entertainment journalist. Later, Jeevan interviews Arthur Leander. After Miranda and Arthur divorce, Arthur marries Elizabeth Colton. Arthur and Elizabeth have a son, Tyler, but Arthur later divorces Elizabeth as well, marrying an actress named Lydia Marks. Elizabeth and Tyler move to Israel.
Years later, Arthur plays King Lear in a stage production in Toronto. Miranda visits him there and gives him two sets of the first two issues of Dr. Eleven. Arthur has decided that he wants to give up acting and move to Israel to live near his son Tyler. He sends one copy of Dr. Eleven to Tyler and gives the other to Kirsten Raymonde, an eight-year-old girl with a small role in the King Lear production. 
Jeevan, who has been training to be a paramedic in an attempt to do something meaningful with his life, attends King Lear in Toronto, excited to see Arthur Leander on stage. During the performance, Arthur has a heart attack and collapses, and Jeevan jumps onto the stage in an unsuccessful attempt to revive him. After Arthur’s sudden death on stage, Jeevan consoles Kirsten. Leaving the theater, Jeevan receives a call from a friend who is a doctor in a Toronto hospital. He tells Jeevan that the Georgia Flu has reached North America and is proving to be extremely virulent. Jeevan stocks up on food and supplies and goes to his paraplegic brother Frank’s apartment building. 
With a 99 percent mortality rate, the Georgia Flu kills much of the world’s population within a few weeks. This event becomes known as “the collapse.” Miranda dies on a beach in Malaysia, delirious with fever. Elizabeth and Tyler happen to be on the same plane as Clark—all three are traveling to Arthur’s funeral—when their plane is diverted to Severn City Airport. The airport is then closed, and most of the stranded passengers flee. Those remaining in the airport try to survive. Elizabeth believes that the Georgia Flu is a form of divine judgment and that she and Tyler have survived for a reason. Tyler’s behavior grows increasingly withdrawn and peculiar. Two years after the collapse, Elizabeth and Tyler leave the airport with a group of religious wanderers. Clark remains at the airport, and over the years he creates a Museum of Civilization in the airport that features artifacts from the time before the collapse.
Jeevan and Frank try to wait out the Georgia Flu in Frank’s apartment, but their supplies begin to dwindle. Frank worries that his disability is hurting Jeevan’s chances of survival, and he commits suicide so that Jeevan no longer has to care for him. Jeevan leaves the apartment and travels south, where he joins a settlement called McKinley and eventually marries and has two children. 
Kirsten Raymonde escapes Toronto with her older brother, and after her brother dies, she joins the Traveling Symphony, an orchestra that performs Shakespeare plays and diverse musical concerts for the settlements around the Great Lakes. Almost two decades after the collapse, Kirsten and the Symphony reach a town called St. Deborah by the Water. Since their last visit two years earlier, the town has been taken over by a religious zealot called “the Prophet.” The Traveling Symphony learns that the Prophet originally came from Severn City; unbeknownst to them, he is Arthur and Elizabeth’s son Tyler. The Symphony asks about Charlie and Jeremy, two members that they left behind on their prior visit. They learn that Charlie and Jeremy fled after the Prophet took over.
When the Traveling Symphony leaves the town, they find that a twelve-year-old girl, Eleanor, has snuck along with them as a stowaway. Some of the Prophet’s men pursue the Symphony to recover Eleanor because she is promised to the Prophet as his wife. Several members of the Symphony are captured by the Prophet’s men, and Kirsten and her friend August become separated. After killing some of the Prophet’s followers, Kirsten and August rescue one of the Symphony members. The Prophet eventually confronts Kirsten near Severn City, but he is killed by one of his own followers, a teenage boy who can no longer endure the terrible things that he has done while serving the Prophet. 
Kirsten and August reunite with the Charlie, Jeremy, and the Traveling Symphony at the Severn City Airport. Kirsten meets Clark and shares her two issues of Dr. Eleven with him. Through a telescope, Clark shows her a distant town to the south that has electricity. When the Traveling Symphony leaves, Clark is hopeful about the future of humanity."
Soon,"The Bottom is a mostly Black community in Ohio, situated in the hills above the mostly white, wealthier community of Medallion. The Bottom first became a community when a master gave it to his former slave. This ""gift"" was in fact a trick: the master gave the former slave a poor stretch of hilly land, convincing the slave the land was worthwhile by claiming that because it was hilly, it was closer to heaven. The trick, though, led to the growth of a vibrant community. Now the community faces a new threat; wealthy whites have taken a liking to the land, and would like to destroy much of the town in order to build a golf course.
Shadrack, a resident of the Bottom, fought in WWI. He returns a shattered man, unable to accept the complexities of the world; he lives on the outskirts of town, attempting to create order in his life. One of his methods involves compartmentalizing his fear of death in a ritual he invents and names National Suicide Day. The town is at first wary of him and his ritual, then, over time, unthinkingly accepts him.
Meanwhile, the families of the children Nel and Sula are contrasted. Nel is the product of a family that believes deeply in social conventions; hers is a stable home, though some might characterize it as rigid. Nel is uncertain of the conventional life her mother, Helene, wants for her; these doubts are hammered home when she meets Rochelle, her grandmother and a former prostitute, the only unconventional woman in her family line. Sula's family is very different: she lives with her grandmother, Eva, and her mother, Hannah, both of whom are seen by the town as eccentric and loose. Their house also serves as a home for three informally adopted boys and a steady stream of borders.
Despite their differences, Sula and Nel become fiercely attached to each other during adolescence. However, a traumatic accident changes everything. One day, Sula playfully swings a neighborhood boy, Chicken Little, around by his hands. When she loses her grip, the boy falls into a nearby river and drowns. They never tell anyone about the accident even though they did not intend to harm the boy. The two girls begin to grow apart. One day, in an accident, Sula's mother's dress catches fire and she dies of the burns.
After high school, Nel chooses to marry and settles into the conventional role of wife and mother. Sula follows a wildly divergent path and lives a life of fierce independence and total disregard for social conventions. Shortly after Nel's wedding, Sula leaves the Bottom for a period of 10 years. She has many affairs, some with white men. However, she finds people following the same boring routines elsewhere, so she returns to the Bottom and to Nel.
Upon her return, the town regards Sula as the very personification of evil for her blatant disregard of social conventions. Their hatred in part rests upon Sula's interracial relationships, but is crystallized when Sula has an affair with Nel's husband, Jude, who subsequently abandons Nel. Ironically, the community's labeling of Sula as evil actually improves their own lives. Her presence in the community gives them the impetus to live harmoniously with one another. Nel breaks off her friendship with Sula. Just before Sula dies in 1940, they achieve a half-hearted reconciliation. With Sula's death, the harmony that had reigned in the town quickly dissolves.
In 1965, with the Bottom facing the prospect of the white golf course, Nel visits Eva in the nursing home. Eva accuses her of sharing the guilt for Chicken Little's death. Her accusation forces Nel to confront the unfairness of her judgment against Sula. Nel admits to herself that she had blamed his death entirely on Sula and set herself up as the ""good"" half of the relationship. Nel comes to realize that in the aftermath of Chicken Little's death she had too quickly clung to social convention in an effort to define herself as ""good."" Nel goes to the cemetery and mourns at Sula's grave, calling out Sula's name in sadness.
Sula is a novel about ambiguity. It questions and examines the terms ""good"" and ""evil,"" often demonstrating that the two often resemble one another. The novel addresses the confusing mysteries of human emotions and relationships, ultimately concluding that social conventions are inadequate as a foundation for living one's life. The novel tempts the reader to apply the diametrically opposed terms of ""good and evil,"" ""right and wrong"" to the characters and their actions, and yet simultaneously shows why it is necessary to resist such temptation. While exploring the ways in which people try to make meaning of lives filled with conflicts over race, gender, and simple idiosyncratic points of views, Sula resists easy answers, demonstrating the ambiguity, beauty, and terror of life, in both its triumphs and horrors."
Aided,"Educated is primarily retrospective, consisting of Tara Westover's memories about her past. She tells the story of the events of her life from a vantage point in her late twenties, occasionally interjecting to comment on the process of trying to arrive at an accurate version of the past. Tara was born the youngest of seven children to parents whom she refers to as Faye and Gene (pseudonyms). The Westover family lived on a farm in rural Idaho, where Gene made a living salvaging scrap metal while Faye worked as an unlicensed midwife and herbal healer. Gene suffered from paranoid fears about interference from the federal government, and as a result he refused to allow his children to attend school, receive birth certificates, or receive medical attention. Gene was also a devout Mormon who believed in radical self-sufficiency and an impending Day of Judgement.
		
Shifts in the Westover family dynamic began to emerge when Tara was about nine. Her mother's work as a midwife increased her sense of independence, but after sustaining a serious and untreated brain injury in a car accident, Faye began to lose confidence in her skills, and focused instead on using herbal remedies and a form of intuitive healing. Around this time, Tyler (the third son) announced that he was going to attend college, which estranged him from his family. Tyler's absence forced Tara to become more involved in helping her father with his scrapping work, which left her constantly exposed to the possibility of dangerous injury. It also made her more curious about possibly pursuing an education herself. When Tara was ten, she told her disapproving father that she wanted to begin going to school, but nothing came of the idea.
As Tara grew into her teens, she acquired more independence from her family due to taking on various jobs and pursuing singing and musical theatre in the local community. However, her life was dominated by the strict rules and religious doctrine her father imposed, and Tara often worried about becoming sinful. When Tara was thirteen, her older brother Shawn moved back home. At first Shawn and Tara were close and spent a lot of time together. When Tara was about fifteen, however, Shawn began to be physically abusive toward her. His behavior only got worse after Shawn experienced a head injury. Tyler eventually realized that Shawn was hurting Tara, and he urged Tara to seriously consider applying to college and getting away from the family. Although she was uncertain at first, Tara began to study and was eventually accepted at Brigham Young University, having passed herself off as homeschooled.
In January 2004, when Tara was seventeen years old, she moved to Utah to begin her college education. She found the adjustment very difficult at first, but eventually began to excel in her studies. Tara's finances were precarious, and she had to hold multiple jobs and maintain very high grades to retain her scholarship. Her emerging independence also caused a threatening dynamic between her, Gene, and Shawn. Whenever Tara returned to Buck's Peak, her father manipulated her into working for him, while Shawn continued to physically and emotionally abuse her. Tara eventually confided to a bishop about her life, and he helped her to secure funding to finance her education. Tara's studies, and the people she met, also gradually opened her eyes to different realities and force her to realize how damaging and isolating her childhood has been. Tara eventually changed her major to studying history, and is encouraged to apply for a study abroad program at Cambridge University in England.
Tara's experience at Cambridge broadened her horizons even further, and she was encouraged to consider graduate studies. Tara still felt isolated from her peers, and ashamed of her origins. She hid most of her past even from her friends and the men she occasionally dated. She was eventually awarded a prestigious Cambridge Gates Fellowship and moved to England to pursue a Master's degree. She remained in close contact with her family and returned to Idaho regularly to visit, but her relationship with them deteriorated. Shawn was growing increasingly erratic and violent, and Tara feared for the safety of his wife and young child. By chance, she revealed to her sister Audrey that Shawn had been abusive with her, and Audrey later confided that Shawn abused her as well. Audrey blamed herself for not protecting her younger sister, and suggested that she and Tara confront their parents and Shawn about what happened to them.
By then Tara had built a happy life for herself in England, and was working on a PhD in history at Cambridge. However, the attempt to speak the truth quickly became a source of conflict in the family. Tara became more and more ostracized within her family, eventually culminating in Shawn learning that she had been telling their parents about the abuse she suffered. Realizing her family would never trust her claims, Tara became estranged from most of them, with the exception of Tyler.  The estrangement from her family prompted grief and depression for Tara, but she was finally able to heal, and successfully completed her PhD. By the end of her memoir, Tara has accepted that she may never have a relationship with her family again, but she takes pride in the independence she has established, and the life she has built for herself."
Transfers,"Manhattan Transfer tells the story of multiple characters in as they make their way in New York. Their stories illustrate that what is most important in New York City are shallow qualities, such as wealth, youth, and material possessions.  
Bud Korpenning is a farm boy who comes to New York looking for work. He struggles to make his way in a city focused on superficial qualities. He is also always looking over his shoulder and avoiding the police. After he has been in the city for months, he still has not been able to find steady work, and he lives in a homeless shelter. This is primarily due to the stranglehold that unions have on labor in the city. Compounding Bud’s lack of education and money is the fact that he does not have a union card. While in the shelter, Bud shares with another man that he killed his father before he left the farm. The pressure has become too great, and Bud loses hope that he will be able to make a life for himself in the city. He jumps to his death from the Brooklyn Bridge.  
Ellen loses her mother at a young age. Even before her mother’s death, though, Ellen is raised by her father, Ed. After Ed leaves the city to live a quiet life in New Jersey as an accountant, he reads about his famous daughter in the gossip pages with discomfort. Ellen becomes a Broadway actress. Her first marriage is to Jojo Oglethorpe and is one of convenience for both of them. Ellen gets out of the chorus and uses Jojo’s clout in the industry to get more impressive parts. Jojo, in return, has cover for his homosexuality. Destined to fail, the two end the marriage after a public and embarrassing scene in the apartment building where they live with other actors. During her marriage to Jojo, Ellen begins an affair with Stan, another ill-fated relationship. Ellen and Stan love each other, but they both have self-destructive tendencies.  
The son of a wealthy and well-connected New York lawyer, Stan is a ne’er-do-well who gets fired from Harvard because of his excessive drinking. He becomes fast friends with Jimmy, a newspaper reporter and another of Ellen’s admirers. From Jimmy’s perspective, things seem to come easy for Stan. He has a different approach to life than Jimmy, who is cerebral and overanalyzes everything. Unlike Jimmy, Stan is materialistic and has demons that he keeps at bay with alcohol. On his last night, before killing himself in a drunken stupor, Stan goes to a dance that he has no business attending and makes a scene before getting thrown out. Not only does Stan leave behind Ellen and an unborn baby, but he also squanders his potential to be a successful architect.  
When Jimmy returns to New York with his mother Lily as a young boy, things seem hopeful. Soon though, he is thrown into a lonely future when Lily passes away after a short illness. The city can never again be a happy place for Jimmy. Ellen is the only other woman besides his mother that Jimmy ever loves, but she is with Stan when Jimmy meets her. After Stan’s tragic death, Ellen and Jimmy marry in Europe during World War I. This is a convenient match for Ellen because her baby Martin will have a father. The couple’s time in Europe is the only time Jimmy is happy. Upon returning, he always talks about leaving the city, but he does not do so until the end of his story.  
Throughout almost the entire book, and during her many other relationships, Ellen sees a man named George Baldwin. George is a successful New York lawyer who, by the end of the book, has developed political aspirations. While he enters a doomed marriage to improve his social standing, he only loves Ellen. Ellen continues to see George during her marriage to Jojo and her relationship with Stan. The only time the two do not see each other regularly is when she returns from Europe, as a new wife and mother. Both of them are finally single by the end of the book, and George is desperate to marry Ellen. She unceremoniously agrees to marry him, although she feels herself physically hardening at the thought of it.  She resents George, but in keeping with her tendency to plan ahead, she marries him because she is getting older and is running out of options if she wants to stay relevant in a materialistic New York."
Legislative,"The Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. writes “Letter from Birmingham Jail” in April 1963 in response to being imprisoned for his efforts to desegregate Birmingham, an important, industrial Alabama city known for its repressive and regressive policies during the 1960s. King decides to write because the Birmingham campaign, King’s policies, and his very presence have been attacked in print by eight white clergymen. King never names his critics, but his letter offers a detailed renunciation of their charges that his efforts are ill-timed, misguided, and inopportune. Bringing together ideas from philosophy, history, religion, and his own experience, King defends the program of nonviolent direct action and argues powerfully for the need to end racial injustice in the United States. 
The letter falls into two main parts. In its first half, approximately the first 22 paragraphs, King rejects the criticisms lodged against him by the white clergymen, particularly their admonition to wait for a more appropriate moment to launch a campaign for racial equality, noting that action is merited based on the deliberate and ongoing lack of response to desegregation legislation. King details the principles of nonviolent direct action, exposes readers to the conditions endured by Black Americans, and defends his belief in the supremacy of moral law over an unjust legal code. Across the letter’s second half, King goes on the offensive, outlining the failings of white moderates, people who are sympathetic in the abstract but judgmental of the tactics deployed in actual campaigns, and the limitations of the white church with regard to endeavors supporting Black Americans obtaining their human rights. The two parts culminate, perhaps improbably, in a hopeful image of a clearing sky, as the dark clouds of racial prejudice finally lift. It presents a powerful argument and vision of what the United States can be. 
King takes inspiration from many different persons in the letter, including white allies, Biblical figures, and people from American history. As he explains across “Letter from Birmingham Jail,” such people understand what it means to recognize the moral imperative to fight injustice. Rather than remain trapped by an unjust legal system or by norms that insist on inequality, they realize that the law of the conscience must sometimes prevail. “Letter from Birmingham Jail” differentiates importantly between different ways of understanding what justice means, suggesting that this intellectual work is also part of any campaign for equality. Although all the work protesters must do is hard—from their careful efforts to prepare themselves for the campaign, enduring brutality and prison, suffering ongoing discrimination and humiliation—he writes in the hopes that others will join the fight. Given that he composes the letter before the Birmingham campaign’s conclusion, it can also be read as an attempt to recruit others to join him in a pacifistic but determined fight for justice and freedom for all."
Base,"Anne’s diary begins on her thirteenth birthday, June 12, 1942, and ends shortly after her fifteenth. At the start of her diary, Anne describes fairly typical girlhood experiences, writing about her friendships with other girls, her crushes on boys, and her academic performance at school. Because anti-Semitic laws forced Jews into separate schools, Anne and her older sister, Margot, attended the Jewish Lyceum in Amsterdam.
	The Franks had moved to the Netherlands in the years leading up to World War II to escape persecution in Germany. After the Germans invaded the Netherlands in 1940, the Franks were forced into hiding. With another family, the van Daans, and an acquaintance, Mr. Dussel, they moved into a small secret annex above Otto Frank’s office where they had stockpiled food and supplies. The employees from Otto’s firm helped hide the Franks and kept them supplied with food, medicine, and information about the outside world.
	The residents of the annex pay close attention to every development of the war by listening to the radio. Some bits of news catch Anne’s attention and make their way into her diary, providing a vivid historical context for her personal thoughts. The adults make optimistic bets about when the war will end, and their mood is severely affected by Allied setbacks or German advances. Amsterdam is devastated by the war during the two years the Franks are in hiding. All of the city’s residents suffer, since food becomes scarce and robberies more frequent.
	Anne often writes about her feelings of isolation and loneliness. She has a tumultuous relationship with the adults in the annex, particularly her mother, whom she considers lacking in love and affection. She adores her father, but she is frequently scolded and criticized by Mr. and Mrs. van Daan and Mr. Dussel. Anne thinks that her sister, Margot, is smart, pretty, and agreeable, but she does not feel close to her and does not write much about her. Anne eventually develops a close friendship with Peter van Daan, the teenage boy in the annex. Mr. Frank does not approve, however, and the intensity of Anne’s infatuation begins to lessen.
	Anne matures considerably throughout the course of her diary entries, moving from detailed accounts of basic activities to deeper, more profound thoughts about humanity and her own personal nature. She finds it difficult to understand why the Jews are being singled out and persecuted. Anne also confronts her own identity. Though she considers herself to be German, her German citizenship has been revoked, and though she calls Holland her home, many of the Dutch have turned against the Jews. Anne feels a tremendous solidarity with her aggrieved people, and yet at the same time she wants to be seen as an individual rather than a member of a persecuted group.
During the two years recorded in her diary, Anne deals with confinement and deprivation, as well as the complicated and difficult issues of growing up in the brutal circumstances of the Holocaust. Her diary describes a struggle to define herself within this climate of oppression. Anne’s diary ends without comment on August 1, 1944, the end of a seemingly normal day that leaves us with the expectation of seeing another entry on the next page. However, the Frank family is betrayed to the Nazis and arrested on August 4, 1944. Anne’s diary, the observations of an imaginative, friendly, sometimes petty, and rather normal teenage girl, comes to an abrupt and silent end. 
Otto Frank is the family’s sole survivor, and he recovers Anne’s diary from Miep. He decides to fulfill Anne’s wishes by publishing the diary. Anne’s diary becomes a condemnation of the unimaginable horror of the Holocaust, and one of the few accounts that describe it from a young person’s perspective.
	Since Anne’s diary is a true personal account of a life in hiding, it is inappropriate to analyze it as a novel or other work of fiction. Parts of the diary were intended for public view, but others clearly were not. To appreciate and interpret the diary, it is necessary to consider its horrible context, World War II and the Holocaust, before any discussion of plot development or thematic content."
Did,"Stanley Yelnats, a boy who has bad luck due to a curse placed on his great- great-grandfather, is sent to Camp Green Lake, a juvenile detention camp, for a crime he did not commit. Stanley and the other boys at the camp are forced to dig large holes in the dirt every day. Stanley eventually realizes that they are digging these holes because the Warden is searching for something. As Stanley continues to dig holes and meet the other boys at the camp, the narrator intertwines three separate stories to reveal why Stanley's family has a curse and what the Warden is looking for.
When he was a boy, Stanley's great-great-grandfather, Elya Yelnats, received a pig from Madame Zeroni, a gypsy, in exchange for a promise. Elya's promise was that after the pig grew strong he would carry Madame Zeroni, who only had one leg, up a mountain and sing her a song that she had taught him. After becoming disillusioned with the girl he thought he loved, however, Elya hops a boat to America, forgetting his promise to Madame Zeroni. Elya marries and has a child in America and always thinks about Madame Zeroni, who he believes has cursed him because of his failure to fulfill his promise. He knows that Madame Zeroni's son lives in America, but Elya never finds him.
One hundred and ten years before Stanley arrives at Camp Green Lake, the town of Green Lake is a beautiful place where peach trees bloom throughout the spring. In this Texas town, the schoolteacher, Katherine Barlow, falls in love with Sam, the onion seller. Sam sells onions to eat and to use for medicinal purposes. While Katherine and Sam are alive, racism is institutionalized in the United States and it is against the law for a black man to kiss a white woman. Because Sam is black and Katherine is white, the people in the town become irate when they find that Katherine and Sam have kissed. Charles, or Trout, Walker, the richest man in town has always wanted to marry Katherine. He is already mad that Katherine does not wish to go out with him so when he finds out that she is in love with Sam he gathers the townspeople to burn the schoolhouse and attack Sam. Katherine seeks help from the local sheriff but instead finds that the sheriff, who makes lewd advances towards her, also wants to kill Sam. Katherine and Sam attempt to escape but their boat is destroyed while only half way across the lake and Sam is killed. Katherine is driven mad by her grief and becomes an outlaw known as Kissin' Kate Barlow. Her name refers to the fact that she kisses the men she kills, leaving a lipstick imprint of her lips on their faces. In her twenty years of robbing people in the west, she happens to rob Stanley's great- grandfather while he is on his way from New York to California. She buries Stanley's great-grandfather's money somewhere and even though Charles Walker and his wife Linda try to torture her into revealing its location, Kate dies before anyone can find out where the money is hidden. After the day that Sam is killed, rain stops falling on Green Lake and the lake dries up.
Because Green Lake dries up, the citizens of the town all move away and by the time that the land is serving as Camp Green Lake, the only people there are juvenile delinquents. Stanley has a hard time digging holes there due to the incredible heat and the hard, dry land. At one point Stanley digs up half of a lipstick tube that has the initials KB on it. Stanley knows that the Warden, who happens to be a descendent of Charles and Linda Walker, is interested in this find and he speculates that perhaps Kate Barlow used to live in the area. The other boys at the camp are tough and all have nicknames. Stanley tries to stay in the good graces of X-Ray, the obvious leader of the group but this becomes harder as Stanley becomes better friends with a boy named Zero. Although Stanley and Zero, also known as Hector Zeroni, do not know it, Hector is the great- great-great-grandson of Madame Zeroni. Zero eventually runs away from camp and Stanley, in an effort to save him, follows after a few days. The two help each other to reach the top of a big mountain, which turns out to be Sam's old onion field. Because Zero is very weak, Stanley carries him up this mountain. They survive on onions for more than a week and then return to camp, planning to search for Kate Barlow's treasure in the hole where Stanley found the lipstick tube.
Stanley and Zero find a suitcase that has the name Stanley Yelnats on it. Although the Warden attempts to take the suitcase from them, Stanley's lawyer, Ms. Morengo, arrives to say that Stanley has been proven innocent and Stanley and Hector are able to leave the camp with the suitcase. It turns out that the suitcase contains many valuable items and is in fact the same suitcase that Kate Barlow took from Stanley's great-grandfather, also named Stanley Yelnats, so many years ago.
At the end of the book, it seems that the Yelnats family curse is lifted. Hector is reunited with his mother, from whom he was separated many years ago and Stanley's father finally succeeds in inventing something: a cure for foot odor. While at Camp Green Lake, Stanley has improved his physical strength and his self-confidence in addition to making a true friend. While fate has so often seemed against Stanley, in the end it serves to help him, his family, and Hector."
Journey,"The play is set in the summer home of the Tyrone family, August 1912. The action begins in the morning, just after breakfast. We learn as the first act unravels that Mary has returned to her family recently after receiving treatment in a sanatorium for morphine addiction. Edmund, meanwhile, has in recent weeks begun to cough very violently, and we learn later on in the play that, as Tyrone and Jamie suspect, he has tuberculosis. Throughout the course of the play, we slowly find out that Mary is still addicted to morphine, much to the disappointment of her family members.
The gradual revelation of these two medical disasters makes up most of the play's plot. In between these discoveries, however, the family constantly revisits old fights and opens old wounds left by the past, which the family members are never unable to forget. Tyrone, for example, is constantly blamed for his own stinginess, which may have led to Mary's morphine addiction when he refused to pay for a good doctor to treat the pain caused by childbirth. Mary, on the other hand, is never able to let go of the past or admit to the painful truth of the present, the truth that she is addicted to morphine and her youngest son has tuberculosis. They all argue over Jamie and Edmund's failure to become successes as their father had always hoped they would become. As the day wears on, the men drink more and more, until they are on the verge of passing out in Act IV.
Most of the plot of the play is repetitious, just as the cycle of an alcoholic is repetitious. The above arguments occur numerous times throughout the four acts and five scenes. All acts are set in the living room, and all scenes but the last occur either just before or just after a meal. Act II, Scene i is set before lunch; scene ii after lunch; and Act III before dinner. Each act focuses on interplay between two specific characters: Act I features Mary and Tyrone; Act II Tyrone and Jamie, and Edmund and Mary; Act III Mary and Jamie; Act IV Tyrone and Edmund, and Edmund and Jamie.
The repetitious plot also helps develop the notion that this day is not remarkable in many ways. Instead, it is one in a long string of similar days for the Tyrones, filled with bitterness, fighting, and an underlying love."
Farm,"Old Major, a prize-winning boar, gathers the animals of the Manor Farm for a meeting in the big barn. He tells them of a dream he has had in which all animals live together with no human beings to oppress or control them. He tells the animals that they must work toward such a paradise and teaches them a song called “Beasts of England,” in which his dream vision is lyrically described. The animals greet Major’s vision with great enthusiasm. When he dies only three nights after the meeting, three younger pigs—Snowball, Napoleon, and Squealer—formulate his main principles into a philosophy called Animalism. Late one night, the animals manage to defeat the farmer Mr. Jones in a battle, running him off the land. They rename the property Animal Farm and dedicate themselves to achieving Major’s dream. The cart-horse Boxer devotes himself to the cause with particular zeal, committing his great strength to the prosperity of the farm and adopting as a personal maxim the affirmation “I will work harder.”
At first, Animal Farm prospers. Snowball works at teaching the animals to read, and Napoleon takes a group of young puppies to educate them in the principles of Animalism. When Mr. Jones reappears to take back his farm, the animals defeat him again, in what comes to be known as the Battle of the Cowshed, and take the farmer’s abandoned gun as a token of their victory. As time passes, however, Napoleon and Snowball increasingly quibble over the future of the farm, and they begin to struggle with each other for power and influence among the other animals. Snowball concocts a scheme to build an electricity-generating windmill, but Napoleon solidly opposes the plan. At the meeting to vote on whether to take up the project, Snowball gives a passionate speech. Although Napoleon gives only a brief retort, he then makes a strange noise, and nine attack dogs—the puppies that Napoleon had confiscated in order to “educate”—burst into the barn and chase Snowball from the farm. Napoleon assumes leadership of Animal Farm and declares that there will be no more meetings. From that point on, he asserts, the pigs alone will make all of the decisions—for the good of every animal.
Napoleon now quickly changes his mind about the windmill, and the animals, especially Boxer, devote their efforts to completing it. One day, after a storm, the animals find the windmill toppled. The human farmers in the area declare smugly that the animals made the walls too thin, but Napoleon claims that Snowball returned to the farm to sabotage the windmill. He stages a great purge, during which various animals who have allegedly participated in Snowball’s great conspiracy—meaning any animal who opposes Napoleon’s uncontested leadership—meet instant death at the teeth of the attack dogs. With his leadership unquestioned (Boxer has taken up a second maxim, “Napoleon is always right”), Napoleon begins expanding his powers, rewriting history to make Snowball a villain. Napoleon also begins to act more and more like a human being—sleeping in a bed, drinking whisky, and engaging in trade with neighboring farmers. The original Animalist principles strictly forbade such activities, but Squealer, Napoleon’s propagandist, justifies every action to the other animals, convincing them that Napoleon is a great leader and is making things better for everyone—despite the fact that the common animals are cold, hungry, and overworked.
Mr. Frederick, a neighboring farmer, cheats Napoleon in the purchase of some timber and then attacks the farm and dynamites the windmill, which had been rebuilt at great expense. After the demolition of the windmill, a pitched battle ensues, during which Boxer receives major wounds. The animals rout the farmers, but Boxer’s injuries weaken him. When he later falls while working on the windmill, he senses that his time has nearly come. One day, Boxer is nowhere to be found. According to Squealer, Boxer has died in peace after having been taken to the hospital, praising the Rebellion with his last breath. In actuality, Napoleon has sold his most loyal and long-suffering worker to a glue maker in order to get money for whisky.
Years pass on Animal Farm, and the pigs become more and more like human beings—walking upright, carrying whips, and wearing clothes. Eventually, the seven principles of Animalism, known as the Seven Commandments and inscribed on the side of the barn, become reduced to a single principle reading “all animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.” Napoleon entertains a human farmer named Mr. Pilkington at a dinner and declares his intent to ally himself with the human farmers against the laboring classes of both the human and animal communities. He also changes the name of Animal Farm back to the Manor Farm, claiming that this title is the “correct” one. Looking in at the party of elites through the farmhouse window, the common animals can no longer tell which are the pigs and which are the human beings."
Grant,"Grant Wiggins has been teaching on a plantation outside Bayonne, Louisiana, for several years when a slow-witted man named Jefferson is convicted of murder and sentenced to death. Jefferson claims he is innocent of the crime. He says he was on his way to a bar, but changed his mind and decided to tag along with two men who were on their way to a liquor store. Upon arriving there, the two men began arguing with the storeowner, and a shootout ensued. The storeowner and the two men died, and Jefferson remained at the scene of the crime. He was arrested and tried for murder. Jefferson’s lawyer argues in court that Jefferson is nothing but a poor fool, hardly more worthwhile than a hog, and therefore incapable of plotting such a scheme. The jury quickly brings back a guilty verdict.
	Upon hearing the lawyer’s speech, Jefferson’s godmother, Miss Emma, resolves to help Jefferson die like a man, not a hog. She asks Grant to help her, knowing that he will resist. Grant left many years prior to attend college, and he returned an educated man. He deplores the injustices done to his fellow black men, but he does not want to get involved in Jefferson’s case. However, after considerable pressure from his aunt, Tante Lou, he agrees to try to help Jefferson. Grant, Miss Emma, and Grant’s aunt go to visit Jefferson in his cell, and they discover that he too heard the lawyer’s words and has taken them to heart. Silent and moody, Jefferson resists Grant’s feeble attempts to reach him. The three visitors spend an uncomfortable hour in the cell and then leave.
	During the next few visits, Jefferson continues to frustrate Grant’s attempts to communicate. When Grant attempts to teach Jefferson about dignity, Jefferson insists that dignity is for “youmans,” not hogs. He eats and snuffles in imitation of a hog and tries to anger Grant with stubbornness and malice, but Grant maintains his patience. Each hour-long visit ends in failure, but Grant continues to try to reach Jefferson. On his fourth visit, Grant sparks a conversation with Jefferson about his final meal. Jefferson admits that he wants a gallon of vanilla ice cream because, although he loves ice cream, he has never had more than a thimbleful at a time. This admission begins to break down the barrier between the two men. Grant borrows money from some townspeople and buys Jefferson a small radio. On his next visit, he brings Jefferson a notebook and asks him to write down whatever thoughts come to his mind. Jefferson promises to do so, and by Grant’s next visit, Jefferson has filled most of a page with thoughts concerning the difference between hogs and men.
	Grant’s relationships with his girlfriend Vivian and with Reverend Ambrose begin to intensify. Despite her love for Grant, Vivian dislikes his tendency to think only of himself, showing little regard for her needs. Grant uses Vivian to escape the troubles of his life, and he continually suggests that they run away from their hometown and their past in the South. The Reverend Ambrose, himself unable to reach Jefferson, urges Grant to put aside his atheistic beliefs and help save not just Jefferson’s character, but his soul. The Reverend declares that Grant must learn to tell lies for the good of others.
	Grant focuses his energy on Jefferson and tries to explain the importance of Jefferson’s death. Jefferson asks Grant if he believes in heaven and Grant replies that he does not, although he qualifies this remark by saying that his atheism does not make him a good man. In fact, Grant says, Jefferson will save even Grant’s atheistic soul if he carries the cross for the sinners on earth. Grant explains that the black community in the quarter has spent centuries enslaved to white men, and that when Jefferson’s attorney called him a hog, he attacked the will and intelligence of the entire black society. In consequence, Jefferson now has the opportunity to stand up for his community. He has become a symbol to his people, and the manner in which he faces his death will bear on their self--confidence and potential.
	Over the next few weeks, Jefferson continues to write in his journal. In March, the governor of Louisiana sets the execution date for two weeks after Easter. As news of Jefferson’s impending death spreads through the town, more and more people begin to visit him. Young children and old men, strangers and friends, all come to -Jefferson’s cell to speak to him. The onslaught of attention makes Jefferson begin to understand the enormity of the task that Grant has given him. He realizes that he has become much more than an ordinary man and that his death will represent much more than an ordinary death. Elated by Jefferson’s progress, Grant nevertheless dreads the execution day, when that progress will be tested.
	Grant cannot bring himself to attend the execution, for he has grown very close to Jefferson. At the time the execution is scheduled to take place, he orders his students to kneel by their desks in honor of Jefferson. He steps outside the classroom, distressed and bewildered. He knows he should have attended the execution. A few minutes later, a deputy comes down from the courthouse and informs Grant that the execution is over. He assures Grant that Jefferson was the bravest man in the room that morning. Grant looks out over the town, numb and heavyhearted, and discovers that he is crying."
Amid,"Band of Brothers: E Company, 506th Regiment, 101st Airborne from Normandy to Hitler's Eagle's Nest is a focused analysis of one of the most prolific war units the United States of America has ever produced, the legendary Easy Company of the 101st Airborne Parachute Infantry Regiment (PIR). Taken from the detailed accounts of campaigns assembled by U.S. Armed Forces historians and first-person accounts, the nonfiction book retells the journey of Easy Company through the eyes of the men who served. From their early days training stateside through to their ultimate victory over the German fighting forces, the book traces the influence Easy Company of the 506th Airborne Division had in shaping the outcome of World War II.
The story starts with the selection of the men for Easy Company. At the time, the PIR is a new type of fighting unit, paratroopers. It is all volunteer because of the extreme training required for the danger the men would be facing. The soldiers who survive the try-out process are profiled as a group of street-savvy pragmatists who figure their best chance to survive the war would be in the company of the best-trained men. The role of leadership in shaping them into efficient soldiers falls to officers with various strengths and weaknesses, both of which contribute to the men’s development. Basic training turns these soldiers into fit infantrymen, and jump school challenges the men to overcome their instincts for safety and learn to love jumping out of airplanes.
After rigorous training, Easy Company leaves the States for England, where the men participate in simulations for D-Day. There they learn that the reality of combat includes the unexpected and the unknown, and their training in flexible response to combat conditions comes to the fore on their first jump on D-Day. Normandy presents on-the-job training in “kill-or-be-killed,” and Lt. Dick Winters begins his career in Easy Company as a brilliant strategist. The bloody battles of Carentan follow as Easy Company learns to capture and hold a town. The men experience failures of nerve and must force themselves into bravery. Their bravado has had a reality check in France, and they must rely on their past training to mentally push through their fears and self-doubts.
Easy Company next deploys to Holland on an ill-conceived operation to secure “hell’s highway,” a road needed for strategic Allied troop movements into Germany. They are met with overwhelming force in the form of fifty-tank German Panzer units and infantry. Although they were at first welcomed by the Dutch civilians as liberators, the Allied soldiers must later watch the people withdraw into silent despair as they fail to hold the towns from German occupation. Easy Company and other Allied soldiers receive orders to travel to “the island,” a five-kilometer-wide area between the Rhine River on the north and the Waal River to the south, captured three weeks earlier. Easy Company’s task is to defend the position from counterattacks, support the British artillery by turning back any German infantry assaults, and serve as forward artillery observers. They push back a 100-man German SS unit, but they lose fifty men to artillery fire before they are relieved by a Canadian division.
In Mourmelon, France, Easy Company’s rest and recovery come to an abrupt end when U.S. Commander Eisenhower sends them to meet Hitler’s surprise offensive in the Ardennes area in Belgium. This event goes down in history as the Battle of the Bulge. In the hasty deployment, the Allied soldiers go to Bastogne to face subzero temperatures and snowy conditions without adequate winter clothing or ammunition. They scrounge bullets from the traumatized retreating American troops they are replacing. The Germans surround Bastogne and pound their position with artillery that inflicts horrible casualties. The siege cuts off Allied soldiers from food and ammunition resupply until General Patton’s tank division breaks the blockade. Easy Company captures Bastogne, Noville, and Rachamps, cutting off the German advance. The bloody campaign brings on combat fatigue, and many soldiers reach their psychological breaking point. The American troops lose half their men.
The Germans launch an operation in Alsace, 160 miles southeast of Bastogne, to draw American troops from the Ardennes area. Easy Company deploys to hold the line in the town of Haguenau on the Moder River and serve as forward artillery observers. They conduct a covert patrol and capture two Germans to use as informants on the enemy’s plan, position, and resources.
Easy Company returns to Mourmelon to rest and resupply and finds that many of their personal items stored there during the campaign in Bastogne have been stolen by other soldiers. Recruits from the States replace their comrades who had fallen in battle, and the veterans train with the enthusiastic replacements to bring them to battle readiness. The division prepares for Operation Eclipse, a drop on and around Berlin, planned for after the Allied armies have crossed the Rhine. To support their advance, the British-American Operation Varsity drops three airborne divisions into the Ruhr area of Germany, where they encounter stiff German resistance. As support, Commander Eisenhower sends the 101st Airborne by truck to Remagen to eliminate this resistance. Easy Company, for the first time, operates in Germany and gets to know the citizens. As the war winds down, they see thousands of survivors living amid hundreds of skeletal corpses left where they fell at the Dachau forced labor camp.
When the Germans formally surrender to Commander Eisenhower, Easy Company is busy securing the Nazi high command’s homes in Berchtesgaden. After learning about their victory, the men celebrate with German fighter pilot Hermann Goering’s champagne. The men next go to Austria to supervise the surrender and processing of German troops before finally making their way home to the United States. The book ends with the stories of their lives after their return."
Dedicated,"Kidnapped tells the story of David Balfour, a young man of the Lowlands, the southern part of Scotland. David's father, Alexander Balfour, has recently died, and his mother died some time before, so he is now an orphan. Since he is now seventeen years old, he has decided it is time to go and seek his fortune. Before he leaves for the city of Edinburgh, he meets with his guardian, Mr. Campbell. Campbell reveals that David has an uncle, Ebenezer Balfour, of the House of Shaws—meaning that David is, to his surprise, from a wealthy family. David decides to go to Cramond, where his uncle lives, and meet his wealthy relatives.
David walks two days to Edinburgh, and soon finds his way to Cramond. As he begins to ask about the House of Shaws, he finds it is an unpopular place. His Uncle Ebenezer seems particularly ill regarded by the community, and is in fact the only occupant of the house. Nevertheless, David continues on to the House of Shaws. Ebenezer gives him a cold welcome, and seems very interested in the death of David's father. Ebenezer treats David badly, almost as if David were a thief, but he wins some of David's respect by giving the lad nearly forty pounds. But when Ebenezer nearly sends David to his death in the tower adjacent to the house, David demands to know why his uncle hates him and, if he does, why he wants him to stay at the House of Shaws.
A cabin boy, Ransome, arrives at the House of Shaws. He has been sent by Captain Hoseason of the Covenant, a ship that deals with some of Ebenezer's financial ventures. Hoseason has requested to see Ebenezer, so the old man decides to go to the port of Queensferry with Ransome and David. David is interested in seeing the ships at the port, so he willingly goes along. At first, Hoseason seems very pleasant. He even warns David that Ebenezer means mischief toward him. Hoseason then asks to speak to David on the boat, and David agrees, being interested in seeing more of the boat. Once he is on, however, the boat swiftly departs, and as he screams at the dock for help, the sailors knock David unconscious.
He awakes in the dark storage deck of the Covenant. As he drifts in and out of sleep, he quickly becomes ill, and soon he is lingering near death. The ship's mate, Riach, demands that the boy be allowed to sleep in the healthier forecastle of the ship with the other sailors. Hoseason reluctantly agrees, and as David recovers he becomes friends with Riach and a few of the other sailors. Then, Ransome is accidentally killed by Mr. Shuan, and David becomes the new cabin boy.
After a few days at this new job, the Covenant strikes and sinks another boat. One man survives, a strange Highland man dressed in the clothing of a French soldier. The stranger tells the captain that he is carrying the rent money for his disenfranchised chieftain. The two men make an agreement that Hoseason will drop the stranger off in Linnhe Loch, but no sooner is the captain gone from the Round-House—the officers' lounge where the visiting stranger is kept—when David overhears the officers plotting to murder the stranger and take his belt. David tells this to the stranger, and agrees to fight by his side. The stranger says his name is Alan Breck Stewart. Alan and David successfully defend the Round-House from the sailors, Alan killing several men and even David taking two himself. Alan, impressed with David's courage, gives David a silver button from his coat. The captain and Alan negotiate, and the captain agrees to drop Alan and David off near Linnhe Loch.
On the way, however, the ship strikes the Torran Rocks and goes down. David escapes and finds himself on an island. The island is separated from a larger main island only by a river, but he can find no way to cross the river. After a few days, a fisherman comes in a boat and reveals to him that the river gets very low at high tide, and David crosses easily.
David then stays at a house, and discovers that Alan himself passed through, having survived the wreck. Alan left instructions that David should follow him to Torosay, and from there go to Alan's homeland of Appin. David heads this way, meeting several disreputable people along the way, including a notorious blind robber; but the young man manages to avoid any great dangers. He meets a pleasant old religious instructor, Henderland, who helps David secure a boat to take him to Appin.
As soon as David arrives in Appin, he comes across a group of four men on horseback. One of the men is Colin Campbell, the King's Regent for that area, whose clan, the Campbells, are hated by Alan and his Stewart clan. As David speaks with Campbell, he is suddenly shot and killed by an unknown assailant. One of the people in Campbell's party accuses David of distracting Campbell so that he could be shot, and just as soldiers are about to apprehend David he is pulled away by Alan, who has been fishing nearby.
Alan and David, now major suspects in the murder, flee to the woods. Alan swears he had nothing to do with the murder, but he must now draw attention away from the real killer. David believes Alan, and they escape to the home of James Stewart, or James of the Glens. James gives them a change of clothes and some little money, but he tells them that he will have to blame them for the murder and put our warrants for their arrest once they are safely gone, so that he will not be blamed for the murder. If James is killed, it will mean great difficulties for the Stewart clan. David and Alan agree to be the scapegoats, and Alan and David are soon fleeing through the wilderness once more.
They hide for a whole day on top of a large rock while English soldiers roam around below, searching for them. They escape and go to a mountain where they rest for several days and send word to James, hoping to get a little more money so that Alan can escape to France. The messenger returns with a note from James' wife; James has been arrested for the murder. She also sends a little more money for David and Alan.
The two continue on their flight, soon reaching the broad, flat region known as the moors. They take some time out to rest, but David oversleeps on his watch, and a troop of English soldiers nearly takes them by surprise. They must run through the wide, flat land on their hands and knees, hiding in small brush and behind rocks. They manage to escape and are ambushed by Highland men who, fortunately, turn out to be men of Cluny Macpherson, another disenfranchised Highland leader. Cluny takes them in his hideout in the mountain of Ben Alder, and while David sleeps for nearly three days, Alan and Cluny play cards. Alan gambles away all their money, including David's. Cluny agrees to give them their money back, plus more, but Cluny is mortified that they thought he would keep the money, David is angry that Alan gambled it away and he has to swallow his pride and ask for it back, and Alan feels guilty for having gambled it all away.
Alan and David continue on their journey toward the Lowlands, but David is now angry and bitter toward Alan. Alan feels remorseful for some time, but when David refuses to warm up at all, Alan thinks that he has personally suffered enough, and soon becomes his usual happy self, taunting David for being a Whig. Alan is a Jacobite, someone who believed the Stuarts, a Highland clan, should be on the throne, whereas Whigs were supporters of the current English monarchy, following the line of William and Mary. David's patience wears thin, and he viciously attacks Alan's honor. Realizing he cannot be forgiven for what he said, David pretends that he is about to die of exhaustion, and Alan becomes very worried and takes David to a house.
Over the course of a month, David recovers. There is some brief trouble when Alan meets Robin Oig, one of the sons of the well-known Highlander Rob Roy Macgregor, who was also a Campbell. But instead of using guns, they duel by playing the bagpipes, and the two men quickly respect one another and a crisis is averted.
David and Alan finally move on and, after some difficulties, reach Queensferry once more. They cross over and David meets with his family's lawyer, Mr. Rankeillor. Rankeillor believes his story, but David's uncle Ebenezer must be dealt with somehow. It turns out that Ebenezer and David's father had had a dispute over a woman, David's mother. They had finally come to an agreement—David's father married his mother, and Ebenezer took the estate and the Balfour fortune, although he was not the elder brother. Rankeillor says the agreement is not legally binding, and that David is the true heir of the estate. But David does not want the House of Shaws, just a pension from its yearly earnings.
To rectify the situation, David plays a trick on Ebenezer. Rankeillor, David, and Alan go to the House of Shaws. Alan walks up to the door alone, and pretends that he is from a bunch of Highlanders who found David alive shortly after the shipwreck on the Torran Rocks. He asks for money to return to the boy, but Ebenezer refuses to pay anything. Alan then says that they'll kill him unless Ebenezer pays to have him kept alive. Ebenezer does not want the boy dead, and as he haggles over how much he will pay he admits that the plan had been for Hoseason to sell the boy into slavery in the Carolinas. At that point, David and Rankeillor reveal themselves, having caught Ebenezer in the confession. Ebenezer and Rankeillor then work out an agreement that David would get two-thirds of the yearly income of the House of Shaws.
David receives a note from Rankeillor that will allow him to collect his money. David then speaks to Alan, and arranges to send him money so that Alan can get passage to France. The two men part, and David wanders into town to claim his fortune."
Governments,"In Common Sense, Thomas Paine argues for American independence. His argument begins with more general, theoretical reflections about government and religion, then progresses onto the specifics of the colonial situation.
Paine begins by distinguishing between government and society. Society, according to Paine, is everything constructive and good that people join together to accomplish. Government, on the other hand, is an institution whose sole purpose is to protect us from our own vices. Government has its origins in the evil of man and is therefore a necessary evil at best. Paine says that government's sole purpose is to protect life, liberty and property, and that a government should be judged solely on the basis of the extent to which it accomplishes this goal.
Paine then considers an imagined scenario in which a small group of people has been placed on an island, and cut off from the rest of society. In time, these people develop ties with one another, and lawmaking becomes inevitable. Paine says the people will be much happier if they are responsible for the creation of the laws that rule them. Paine is also implicitly arguing that such a system of representation is also better for the American colonists. Having expressed his disagreement with British reign in America, Paine proceeds to launch a general attack on the British system of government. Paine says the British system is too complex and rife with contradictions, and that the monarchy is granted far too much power. The British system pretends to offer a reasonable system of checks and balances, but in fact, it does not.
From here Paine moves on to discuss, in general, the notions of monarchy and hereditary succession. Man, Pain argues, was born into a state of equality, and the distinction that has arisen between king and subject is an unnatural one. At first, Paine says, the world was without kings, but the ancient Jews decided they wanted a king. This angered God, but he allowed them to have one. Paine presents pages of biblical evidence detailing God's wrath at the idea of the Jews having a king. The conclusion Paine reaches is that the practice of monarchy originates from sin, and is an institution that the Bible and God condemn. Paine calls hereditary succession an abominable practice. He says that even if people were to choose to have a king, that does not legitimize that King's child acting as a future ruler. Furthermore, hereditary succession has brought with it innumerable evils, such as incompetent kings, corruption, and civil war.
Having dispensed with the preliminary theoretical issues, Paine sets in to discuss the details of the American situation. In response to the argument that America has flourished under British rule, and therefore ought to stay under the king, Paine says that such an argument fails to realize that America has evolved and no longer needs Britain's help. Some say that Britain has protected America, and therefore deserves allegiance, but Paine responds that Britain has only watched over America in order to secure its own economic well-being. Paine adds that most recently, instead of watching over the colonies, the British have been attacking them, and are therefore undeserving of American loyalty.
Paine says that the colonies have little to gain from remaining attached to Britain. Commerce can be better conducted with the rest of Europe, but only after America becomes independent. Paine also asserts that if the colonies remain attached to Britain, the same problems that have arisen in the past will arise in the future. Paine argues that it is necessary to seek independence now, as to do otherwise would only briefly cover up problems that will surely reemerge.
Paine even proposes the form of government that the independent colonies should adopt. His recommendation is for a representative democracy that gives roughly equal weight to each of the colonies.
Paine explains why the current time is a good time to break free of Britain. Primarily, Paine focuses on the present size of the colonies, and on their current capabilities. He presents an inventory of the British Navy and gives calculations revealing how America could build a navy of comparable size. Paine recommends this as a way of ensuring America's security and prosperity in trade. Paine also argues that America is sufficiently small as to be united now. If time were to elapse, and the population of the colonies to grow, the same feeling of unity would not be present. Paine adds that if the Americans revolt now, they can use the vast expanses of uncharted land to the West in order to pay down some of the debt they will incur.
Paine says that as a colony of Britain, America lacks respectability on the international scene. They are seen simply as rebels, and cannot form substantial alliances with other nations. In order to prosper in the long term, the colonies need to be independent. Paine says that, by declaring independence, America will be able to ask for the help of other countries in its struggle for freedom. For all of these reasons, Paine says it is imperative and urgent that the colonies declare independence."
Gives,"Starr Carter, a sixteen-year-old black girl, attends a party in her neighborhood, Garden Heights. Starr goes with Kenya, a friend with whom she shares an older half-brother, Seven. Ever since attending Williamson Prep, a primarily white school, Starr feels out of place in the Garden Heights social scene. When Kenya goes off with other friends, Starr runs into her childhood best friend, Khalil Harris, whom she hasn’t seen in a long time. Gunshots from a gang fight interrupt the party, and Khalil offers to take Starr home. While Khalil drives, he explains rapper Tupac Shakur’s idea that “Thug Life” stands for “The Hate U Give Little Infants F---- Everybody.” Soon after, a white police officer with the badge number one-fifteen pulls them over. Khalil questions the motivation for the stop, and One-Fifteen orders him out of the car and searches him. One-Fifteen commands Khalil not to move, and returns to his car. Khalil opens the door to check on Starr. One-Fifteen fatally shoots Khalil.
Starr has nightmares about the death of another childhood friend, Natasha, who died in the crossfire of a gang shooting. At school on Monday, Starr feels tense around Hailey and Chris, her white friend and boyfriend, as memories of Khalil’s death interrupt her thoughts and she realizes they don’t understand. At the urging of her uncle Carlos, a police officer, Starr goes into the police station after school with her mother, Lisa, to testify about Khalil’s shooting. Starr realizes that the officers are asking more questions about whether Khalil was a troublemaker than about the night of the shooting. She worries that justice for Khalil will not be served. At Khalil’s funeral, a lawyer and activist named April Ofrah confirms Starr’s fears when she announces that the police will not pursue legal action against One-Fifteen and invites the attendees to a rally in Khalil’s honor. Starr blames herself for the police’s inaction. King, the head of a local gang called the King Lords, also interrupts the funeral and places a gray bandana on Khalil’s casket, signifying Khalil’s membership in the King Lords. April Ofrah tells Starr to call her if she needs legal representation.
The news that the police won’t prosecute One-Fifteen leads to days of protests in Garden Heights. During this time, Maverick, Starr’s father, explains to her his interpretation of Tupac’s phrase “Thug Life.” He believes that Thug Life describes a system designed against black communities. Only by speaking out can black communities begin to break the cycle. At the Carter family’s grocery store, a teenage member of the King Lords named DeVante begs Maverick, a former King Lord, to help him leave the gang. Maverick agrees. Starr sees DeVante’s request as a chance to help someone in a similar situation as Khalil. A few days later, Maverick gets into an argument with the neighborhood barber, Mr. Lewis. Although the argument is peaceful, two police officers intervene, and when they see Maverick is Starr’s father, they push him to the ground and search him. Between this scary event and pressure from Kenya, Starr decides that she will no longer be silent.
The District Attorney calls Lisa to announce that a grand jury will hear the case against One-Fifteen and asks if Starr will testify. Starr agrees, and April Ofrah decides to represent Starr pro bono, and also find a way to get Starr a television interview. Meanwhile, DeVante tells Starr that Khalil had never been a member of the King Lords and only sold drugs for King to protect his mother, who had stolen money from King. During Starr’s television interview, she decides, against Ms. Ofrah’s advice, to talk about the truth behind Khalil’s drug dealing. Starr’s implication of King enrages him. The night before her grand jury testimony, someone throws a brick and fires a gun into the Carter household. Unsure if the culprits are the King Lords or the police, Starr almost backs out of testifying. However, she ultimately decides that Khalil needs her truth. She testifies before the grand jury.
Almost two months later, the grand jury announces their decision not to indict One-Fifteen. Starr and some of her friends get caught up in the resulting riots. As she tries to avoid the chaos, Starr stumbles upon a protest led by Ms. Ofrah. She offers Starr the megaphone, and Starr leads a chant in front of the protest. The police try to break up the protest with tear gas. Starr and her friends head to the Carter family store to get milk to help heal their eyes. A Molotov cocktail lands in the store, setting it ablaze and trapping them. Maverick arrives just in time to unlock the back door. King arrives to taunt them, proud about getting his revenge. The police arrive, and King, confident that no one will testify against him, claims ignorance. However, the neighbors rally around the Carter family and tell the police that they saw King throw the Molotov cocktail. The police arrest King. Although the grocery store is in ruins, Starr knows that the family will rebuild. She vows to continue fighting for justice on behalf of Khalil and all other black people killed at the hands of police."
Admonish,"Okonkwo is a wealthy and respected warrior of the Umuofia clan, a lower Nigerian tribe that is part of a consortium of nine connected villages. He is haunted by the actions of Unoka, his cowardly and spendthrift father, who died in disrepute, leaving many village debts unsettled. In response, Okonkwo became a clansman, warrior, farmer, and family provider extraordinaire. He has a twelve-year-old son named Nwoye whom he finds lazy; Okonkwo worries that Nwoye will end up a failure like Unoka.
In a settlement with a neighboring tribe, Umuofia wins a virgin and a fifteen-year-old boy. Okonkwo takes charge of the boy, Ikemefuna, and finds an ideal son in him. Nwoye likewise forms a strong attachment to the newcomer. Despite his fondness for Ikemefuna and despite the fact that the boy begins to call him “father,” Okonkwo does not let himself show any affection for him.
During the Week of Peace, Okonkwo accuses his youngest wife, Ojiugo, of negligence. He severely beats her, breaking the peace of the sacred week. He makes some sacrifices to show his repentance, but he has shocked his community irreparably.
Ikemefuna stays with Okonkwo’s family for three years. Nwoye looks up to him as an older brother and, much to Okonkwo’s pleasure, develops a more masculine attitude. One day, the locusts come to Umuofia—they will come every year for seven years before disappearing for another generation. The village excitedly collects them because they are good to eat when cooked.
Ogbuefi Ezeudu, a respected village elder, informs Okonkwo in private that the Oracle has said that Ikemefuna must be killed. He tells Okonkwo that because Ikemefuna calls him “father,” Okonkwo should not take part in the boy’s death. Okonkwo lies to Ikemefuna, telling him that they must return him to his home village. Nwoye bursts into tears.
As he walks with the men of Umuofia, Ikemefuna thinks about seeing his mother. After several hours of walking, some of Okonkwo’s clansmen attack the boy with machetes. Ikemefuna runs to Okonkwo for help. But Okonkwo, who doesn’t wish to look weak in front of his fellow tribesmen, cuts the boy down despite the Oracle’s admonishment. When Okonkwo returns home, Nwoye deduces that his friend is dead.
Okonkwo sinks into a depression, neither able to sleep nor eat. He visits his friend Obierika and begins to feel revived a bit. Okonkwo’s daughter Ezinma falls ill, but she recovers after Okonkwo gathers leaves for her medicine.
The death of Ogbuefi Ezeudu is announced to the surrounding villages by means of the ekwe, a musical instrument. Okonkwo feels guilty because the last time Ezeudu visited him was to warn him against taking part in Ikemefuna’s death. At Ogbuefi Ezeudu’s large and elaborate funeral, the men beat drums and fire their guns. Tragedy compounds upon itself when Okonkwo’s gun explodes and kills Ogbuefi Ezeudu’s sixteen-year-old son.
Because killing a clansman is a crime against the earth goddess, Okonkwo must take his family into exile for seven years in order to atone. He gathers his most valuable belongings and takes his family to his mother’s natal village, Mbanta. The men from Ogbuefi Ezeudu’s quarter burn Okonkwo’s buildings and kill his animals to cleanse the village of his sin.
Okonkwo’s kinsmen, especially his uncle, Uchendu, receive him warmly. They help him build a new compound of huts and lend him yam seeds to start a farm. Although he is bitterly disappointed at his misfortune, Okonkwo reconciles himself to life in his motherland.
During the second year of Okonkwo’s exile, Obierika brings several bags of cowries (shells used as currency) that he has made by selling Okonkwo’s yams. Obierika plans to continue to do so until Okonkwo returns to the village. Obierika also brings the bad news that Abame, another village, has been destroyed by the white man.
Soon afterward, six missionaries travel to Mbanta. Through an interpreter named Mr. Kiaga, the missionaries’ leader, Mr. Brown, speaks to the villagers. He tells them that their gods are false and that worshipping more than one God is idolatrous. But the villagers do not understand how the Holy Trinity can be accepted as one God. Although his aim is to convert the residents of Umuofia to Christianity, Mr. Brown does not allow his followers to antagonize the clan.
Mr. Brown grows ill and is soon replaced by Reverend James Smith, an intolerant and strict man. The more zealous converts are relieved to be free of Mr. Brown’s policy of restraint. One such convert, Enoch, dares to unmask an egwugwu during the annual ceremony to honor the earth deity, an act equivalent to killing an ancestral spirit. The next day, the egwugwu burn Enoch’s compound and Reverend Smith’s church to the ground.
The District Commissioner is upset by the burning of the church and requests that the leaders of Umuofia meet with him. Once they are gathered, however, the leaders are handcuffed and thrown in jail, where they suffer insults and physical abuse.
After the prisoners are released, the clansmen hold a meeting, during which five court messengers approach and order the clansmen to desist. Expecting his fellow clan members to join him in uprising, Okonkwo kills their leader with his machete. When the crowd allows the other messengers to escape, Okonkwo realizes that his clan is not willing to go to war.
When the District Commissioner arrives at Okonkwo’s compound, he finds that Okonkwo has hanged himself. Obierika and his friends lead the commissioner to the body. Obierika explains that suicide is a grave sin; thus, according to custom, none of Okonkwo’s clansmen may touch his body. The commissioner, who is writing a book about Africa, believes that the story of Okonkwo’s rebellion and death will make for an interesting paragraph or two. He has already chosen the book’s title: The Pacification of the Primitive Tribes of the Lower Niger."
Mills,"Maggie Tulliver is the impetuous, clever younger daughter of the Tullivers of Dorlcote Mill in St. Ogg's. Maggie frustrates her superficial mother with her unconventional dark coloring and unnatural activeness and intelligence. Maggie's father often takes Maggie's side, but it is Maggie's older brother Tom upon whom she is emotionally dependent. Maggie's greatest happiness is Tom's affection, and his disapproval creates dramatic despair in Maggie, whose view of the world, as all children's, lacks perspective.
Though Tom is less studious than Maggie appears to be, Mr. Tulliver decides to pay for Tom to have additional education rather than have him take over the mill. This decision provokes a family quarrel between Mr. Tulliver and his wife's sisters, the Dodsons. Mr. Tulliver is frustrated by the snobbish contrariness of the Dodsons, led by Mrs. Tulliver's sister Mrs. Glegg, and vows to repay money that Mrs. Glegg had lent him, thereby weakening her hold on him. He has lent almost an equal sum to his sister and her husband, the Mosses, but he feels affectionately toward his sister and decides not to ask for money back, which they cannot pay.
Mr. Stelling, a clergyman, takes Tom on as a student, and Maggie visits him at school several times. On one of these visits, she befriends Mr. Stelling's other student—the sensitive, crippled Philip Wakem, son of her father's enemy, Lawyer Wakem. Maggie herself is sent to school along with her cousin, Lucy, but is called home when she is thirteen when her father finally loses his extended lawsuit with Lawyer Wakem over the use of the river Floss. Mr. Tulliver is rendered bankrupt and ill. Tom returns home as well to support the family, as the Dodson's offer little help. The mill itself is up for auction, and Lawyer Wakem, based on an idea inadvertently furnished to him by Mrs. Tulliver, buys Dorlcote Mill and retains Mr. Tulliver as a manager in an act of humiliating patronage.
Even after Mr. Tulliver's recovery, the atmosphere at the Tullivers' is grim. One bright spot is the return of Bob Jakin, a childhood friend of Tom's, into Tom and Maggie's life. Bob, a trader, kindly buys books for Maggie and one of them—Thomas a Kempis's The Imitation of Christ—influences a spiritual awakening in her that leads to many months of pious self-denial. It is only after Maggie reencounters Philip Wakem on one of her walks in the woods that she is persuaded to leave her martyrish dullness in favor of the richness of literature and human interaction. Philip and Maggie meet clandestinely for a year, since Maggie's father would be hurt by their friendship as he has sworn to hold Lawyer Wakem as his life-long enemy. Philip finally confesses to Maggie that he loves her, and Maggie, at first surprised, says she loves him back. Soon thereafter, Tom discovers their meetings, cruelly upbraids Philip, and makes Maggie swear not to see Philip again.
On a business venture with Bob Jakin, Tom has amassed enough money to pay off Mr. Tulliver's debts to the family's surprise and relief. On the way home from the official repayment of the debts, Mr. Tulliver meets Lawyer Wakem and attacks him, but then Mr. Tulliver falls ill himself and dies the next day.
Several years later, Maggie has been teaching in another village. Now a tall, striking woman, she returns to St. Ogg's to visit her cousin Lucy, who has taken in Mrs. Tulliver. Lucy has a handsome and rich suitor named Stephen Guest, and they are friends with Philip Wakem. Maggie asks Tom for permission to see Philip, which Tom grudgingly gives her. Maggie and Philip renew their close friendship, and Maggie would consider marriage to Philip, if only his father approved. Lucy realizes that Tom wishes to purchase back Dorlcote Mill, and she asks Philip to speak to his father, Lawyer Wakem. Philip speaks to his father about selling the mill and about his love for Maggie, and Lawyer Wakem is eventually responsive to both propositions.
Meanwhile, however, Stephen and Maggie have gradually become helplessly attracted to each other, against both of their expectations and wishes. Maggie plans for their attraction to come to nothing, as she will take another teaching post away from St. Ogg's soon. Stephen pursues her, though, and Philip quickly becomes aware of the situation. Feeling ill and jealous, Philip cancels a boat- ride with Maggie and Lucy, sending Stephen instead. As Lucy has proceeded down river, meaning to leave Philip and Maggie alone, Stephen and Maggie find themselves inadvertently alone together. Stephen rows Maggie past their planned meeting point with Lucy and begs her to marry him. The weather changes and they are far down the river. Maggie complacently boards a larger boat with Philip, which is headed for Mudport. They sleep over night on the boat's deck and when they reach Mudport, Maggie holds firm in her decision to part with Stephen and return to St. Ogg's.
On her return to St. Ogg's, Maggie is treated in town as a fallen woman and a social outcast. Tom, now back in Dorlcote Mill, renounces her, and Maggie, accompanied by her mother, goes to lodge with Bob Jakin and his wife. Despite public knowledge of Stephen's letter, which acknowledges all the blame upon himself, Maggie is befriended only by the Jakins and the clergyman Dr. Kenn. Lucy, who has been prostrate with grief, becomes well again and secretly visits Maggie to show her forgiveness. Philip, as well, sends a letter of forgiveness and faithfulness.
Stephen sends Maggie a letter renewing his pleas for her hand in marriage and protesting the pain she has caused him. Maggie vows to bear the burden of the pain she has caused others and must endure herself until death but wonders to herself how long this trial, her life, will be. At this moment, water begins rushing under the Jakin's door from the nearby river Floss, which is flooding. Maggie wakes the Jakins' and takes one of their boats, rowing it down river in a feat of miraculous strength toward Dorlcote Mill. Maggie rescues Tom, who is trapped in the house, and they row down river towards Lucy. Before they can reach Lucy's house, the boat is capsized by debris in the river, and Maggie and Tom drown in each other's arms. Years go by and Philip, and Stephen and Lucy together, visit the grave."
Walls,"Jeannette Walls begins her memoir with a scene from adulthood. While in a cab in New York City, Jeannette looks out the window and sees her mother dumpster diving. She ducks down in her seat to avoid being recognized, but later invites her mother to lunch to talk about how she can help. Mom insists that she and Dad like being homeless and admonishes Jeannette for being ashamed of her own family. From here, Jeannette’s narration goes back in time to her very first memory. At three years old, Jeannette lives in a trailer park with Mom, Dad, her older sister Lori, and her little brother Brian. Jeannette’s tutu catches fire while she cooks hot dogs over a stove, and her mother rushes her to the hospital for an emergency skin graft. After six weeks in the hospital, Dad smuggles her out without paying the bill. Back at home, Jeannette goes back to cooking unsupervised and starts playing with matches.
One night, Dad makes the family pack all their belongings into the family car and move towns in the middle of the night, a routine he calls “doing the skedaddle.” Over the next several years, the Wallses do the skedaddle dozens of times, moving all over to stay ahead of debt collectors and law enforcement. They spend a month or two in larger cities like Las Vegas and San Francisco, where Dad can make quick money by gambling. Most of the time, however, the Wallses live in isolated desert mining towns, where Mom and Dad teach their children reading and math, as well as specialized survival skills. Dad drinks often and struggles to keep a job for long, but he promises his family that their nomadic lifestyle is temporary. He promises to find gold and build his family the Glass Castle, a large, self-sustaining home made out of glass.
When Jeannette is in first grade, Mom gives birth to another baby, Maureen. Dad moves the family to Battle Mountain, Nevada, where he works as an electrician. The family enjoys six months of relative stability until Dad loses his job. After an explosive argument, Mom gets a teaching job. Dad confiscates most of her paycheck, and the family continues to go hungry. Their time in Nevada comes to an end when Billy Deel, a delinquent neighbor boy whose advances Jeannette rejected, comes to the Walls residence and opens fire with his BB gun. Jeannette returns fire with Dad’s pistol. She misses him on purpose, but the police get involved. The family flees to Phoenix. On the way to Phoenix, Jeannette learns that Grandma Smith has passed, leaving Mom a large sum of money and a house. They move into the massive house, and Dad gets a job as an electrician. For about a year, the kids enjoy regular meals, their own bicycles, and public schooling. Unfortunately, Dad loses his job, and his alcoholism reaches crushing lows. The family is once again destitute. Mom decides it’s time to move to Dad’s hometown of Welch, West Virginia.
When the Wallses arrive in Welch, they stay with Jeannette’s paternal grandmother, Erma. Erma is a bitter, unwelcoming host, and most people in Welch regard the Wallses as self-important outsiders. When Mom and Dad leave for an extended road trip to Phoenix, Erma molests Brian. Jeannette and Lori confront her, but Erma retaliates violently. Dad takes Erma’s side when he returns, but Erma evicts the family. The Wallses buy a small, rotting house with no running water or indoor plumbing. Dad admits that the conditions are not ideal, but promises to use the land to begin construction on the Glass Castle. To help Dad get started on the Glass Castle, Brian and Jeannette dig a large hole for the foundation, but the family soon fills it with garbage. To survive, the kids start dumpster diving and stealing food from their classmates and neighbors. Desperate, Jeannette begs Mom to divorce Dad so they can go on welfare, but Mom refuses.
When the Wallses get a visit from child protective services, Mom finds a teaching job. The money could solve their problems, but Dad’s extensive drinking once again drains their funds, and the family continues to go hungry. The following summer, Mom goes to Charleston for several weeks to renew her teaching license. Left in control of the family finances, Jeannette finds that she, too, gives into Dad’s demands for more money. When Mom returns from Charleston, she announces that she will quit her job and devote all her time to art. Jeannette finally confronts Mom and Dad about their selfishness, but Dad whips her in retaliation. Appalled, Jeannette and Lori plan to move to New York City as soon as possible. Jeannette, Lori, and Brian find jobs around Welch and save all their money for almost a year, but Dad steals the money just months before Lori’s planned departure. In the end, Jeannette secures Lori a summer babysitting job that includes a bus ticket to New York City as payment.
Lori loves life in New York City, where she works in a restaurant and lives in a women’s hostel. Jeannette moves to the city a year later and finishes high school there, interning at a Brooklyn newspaper for credit. Brian follows a year later. Jeannette starts college at Barnard, putting herself through with grants, loans, and savings from odd jobs. Maureen moves in with Lori at age twelve. Dad accuses Lori of stealing his children, and he and Mom move to New York City three years later. After being kicked out of several apartments, Mom and Dad first live on the streets, and then become squatters. At this point, Jeannette has married and works at a prestigious magazine. Lori is an artist, and Brian is a police officer. Maureen drops out of college and moves in with Mom and Dad. Maureen tries to stab Mom, and must spend a year in a psychiatric hospital. The family drifts apart, and a year later Dad dies of a heart attack. Five years after Dad’s death, Jeannette and her second husband, John, host the family for Thanksgiving, though without Maureen. They toast to Dad’s life."
Theory,"Darwin’s theory is based on the notion of variation. It argues that the numerous traits and adaptations that differentiate species from each other also explain how species evolved over time and gradually diverged. Variations in organisms are apparent both within domesticated species and within species throughout the natural world. Variations in colors, structures, organs, and physical traits differentiate a multitude of species from one another. Heredity is the mechanism that perpetuates variations, Darwin argues, as traits are passed from parents to offspring. What is important about these variations to Darwin, though, is the way they allow species to adapt and survive in the natural world. He gives numerous examples of variations that illustrate the wondrous adaptations that allow species to survive in their natural environments: the beak that allows the woodpecker to gather insects, the wings that allow the bat to fly, the paddles that allow the porpoise to swim, and so on. Darwin hypothesizes that the minor variations we see within a single species—such as variations in size, shape, and color of organisms—are related to the more distinct variations seen across different species. His theory of evolution explains how variations cause the origin of species.
Natural selection is the key component of Darwin’s theory, as it explains the relationship between variation and the eventual evolution of a species. Borrowing from Thomas Malthus’s principle of exponential population growth, Darwin argues that the possibility of infinite growth of population sizes is checked by the limits of geography and natural resources, which will not allow an infinite number of beings to survive. As a result of limited food, water, shelter, and so on, species must engage in a “struggle for existence,” creating competition for survival. What decides, then, which species will survive and which will become extinct? Here is where “natural selection” comes in. Darwin argues that organisms exhibiting “advantageous variations”—variations that will allow them to adapt to their environment better than other organisms do—will be more likely to survive. Through heredity, these advantageous variations will be passed on to the organisms’ offspring. Eventually, natural selection will allow those species best adapted to their environments to survive and prosper, while species without these advantageous adaptations will lose the struggle for existence and become extinct.
Natural selection is the mechanism that leads to “descent with modification,” Darwin’s term for the process of evolution. Organisms will continually give birth to offspring that carry variations, some of which are advantageous and some of which are not. As advantageous variations are naturally selected and become perpetuated through successive generations, organisms carrying these advantageous variations will diverge from the original species, eventually becoming a species of their own. Continual modification and divergence, then, create a branching scheme of evolution, in which new species continually branch off from old ones. The “branches” help biologists link later species back to an original parent species, identifying the point at which different species are related to one another. Darwin notes that existing classification systems developed by naturalists already show these relationships between species. Darwin’s theory of descent with modification, then, simply provides an explanation for why many species seem so similar: Either they evolved from one another, or they both evolved from a common parent species.
After laying out the main principles of his theory in the early chapters of On the Origin of Species, Darwin devotes much of the rest of the book to defending his theory against criticisms and presenting detailed examples of how natural selection occurs. The geological record is a formidable impediment to Darwin’s theory, as the existing fossil record does not provide the “missing links” in the chains of descent that Darwin proposes. In response, Darwin argues that the geological record is imperfect and that many fossil remains have been destroyed by changes in the earth or have yet to be discovered.
Darwin also attempts to explain how variations occur in species, driving natural selection and the creation of new species. Geographical isolation is a key component of Darwin’s theory. Darwin hypothesizes that because all species originated from one or a few original beings, species needed modes of transportation to migrate between geographical areas throughout the world. Barriers such as oceans and mountain ranges restrict the ability of organisms to migrate, and the few that manage to do so play a large role in shaping the evolution of species on islands and in geographically isolated areas. Geographical isolation accounts for the plethora of unique species on islands, as well as the wider distribution of species across continents.
Darwin’s theory challenged not only the prevailing view of the independent creation of species but also larger claims of religion and science. Darwin explicitly denied the validity of natural theology, which posited that species’ adaptations to their environments was proof of their “intelligent design” by a creator. It was natural selection, not independent creation, that resulted in these adaptations, Darwin argued. Moreover, Darwin’s use of scientific methodology to prove his theory amounted to an explicit critique of naturalists who would attempt to ignore the scientific validity of his theory because of its controversial nature. While the text of The Origin of Species did leave room for religious theology, Darwin’s overall commitment to scientific rationale rather than theological reasoning pitted him against religious doctrine. Darwin’s text was controversial when it was published, and it remains controversial today. However, his theory of natural selection has stood the test of time in scientific circles, and it remains the leading scientific explanation for the origin of species."
Seasons,"The Common Man figures prominently both in the plot of the play and also as a narrator and commentator. Although treated in more detail in other sections, in the following plot summary, his presence is indicated only when he interacts directly with the other characters in the play.
Sir Thomas More, a scholar and statesman, objects to King Henry VIII’s plan to divorce and remarry in order to father a male heir. But More, ever the diplomat, keeps quiet about his feelings in the hopes that Henry will not bother him about the matter. At a meeting with Cardinal Wolsey, Lord Chancellor of England, More reviews the letter to Rome that requests the pope’s approval of Henry’s divorce. More points out that the pope provided a dispensation, or exemption, in order for Henry to get married in the first place, since Catherine, the woman Henry married, was the widow of Henry’s brother. More doubts that the pope will agree to overturn his first dispensation. Wolsey accuses More of being too moralistic and recommends that he be more practical.
 
After conversing with Wolsey, More runs into Thomas Cromwell, the king’s confidante. Cromwell, recently promoted to the position of cardinal’s secretary, insincerely tells More he is one of More’s greatest admirers. More also meets Signor Chapuys, the Spanish ambassador to England. Chapuys takes More’s noncommittal response to questions about his meeting with Wolsey to mean that More agrees that the divorce should not go through. Chapuys stresses Christian morals and Catholic dogma and seems most concerned that Henry does not insult Henry’s wife, Catherine, who is also the king of Spain’s aunt. Chapuys thinks he has found an ally in More.
 
Back at More’s home, More’s daughter, Margaret, has received a visit from Roper, her Lutheran boyfriend, despite the late hour. Roper asks More for Margaret’s hand, but More refuses to allow a Lutheran, in his eyes a heretic, into his family.
 
Meanwhile, Wolsey dies, leaving the position of Lord Chancellor vacant. The king was displeased with Wolsey’s failure to secure a papal dispensation to annul his marriage to Catherine, and Wolsey died in disgrace. More is appointed as Wolsey’s replacement.
 
Cromwell meets with Richard Rich, a low-level functionary whom More helped establish and to whom More gave a silver cup he was given as a bribe. (More did not realize that the cup was a bribe when he received it.) Cromwell tempts Rich with an opportunity for advancement, and the spineless Rich seems all too eager to accept the job in exchange for information he has about More. Rich and Chapuys, who has just entered, ask Cromwell what his current position is, and Cromwell announces simply that he does whatever the king wants done. He mentions that the king has planned a boat ride down the Thames to visit More. Meanwhile, More’s manservant, Matthew (played by the Common Man), has entered the room, and Cromwell, Rich, and Chapuys are eager to bribe him for information. Matthew tells them only the most well known facts about his master, but the trio pays him off anyway.
 
Back at More’s home in London’s Chelsea district, the king is set to arrive, but More is nowhere to be found. After fretting over his absence, the family eventually finds him busy at vespers (evening prayers). When the king arrives, all are on their best behavior, and More comes off as the most flattering of all. However, More does tell the king that More cannot agree to the divorce, reminding him that the king promised not to bother More about it. The king storms off, telling More he will leave him alone provided More does not speak out against the divorce. Alice, More’s wife, is angry at his behavior and thinks her husband should do as Henry wants. Rich arrives to tell More that Cromwell and Chapuys are collecting information about him. He asks for employment, but More turns him away.
 
At a local pub called the Loyal Subject, Cromwell meets Rich to conspire against More. Rich is reluctant and guilt-ridden, but he ultimately agrees to tell Cromwell about the bribe that More received and passed on to him. In exchange, Cromwell offers Rich a job.
 
Parliament passes the Act of Supremacy, which establishes the Church in England and appoints King Henry as its head. More decides that if the English bishops decide to go along with the act, he will resign as Lord Chancellor. Both Chapuys and Roper call it a remarkable “gesture,” but More, dead set against the act, thinks of it as a practical necessity. He refuses to explain himself to anyone but the king. Even his wife and daughter cannot know his reasons, because he does not want to put them in the position of having to testify against him later.
 
Cromwell meets with the Duke of Norfolk and tells him of his plan to bring More up on bribery charges. Norfolk proves that More gave the cup to Rich as soon as More realized it was a bribe, and Cromwell is forced to come up with some other way to entrap More. He tells Norfolk, however, that the king expects him to participate in the persecution of More.
 
A now impoverished More refuses to receive a letter of appreciation from the king of Spain, and he turns down the bishops’ sincere offer of charity. Cromwell calls More to his office and attempts to malign More by accusing him of sympathizing with the Holy Maid of Kent, who was executed for treason. Cromwell also accuses him of having written a book attributed to King Henry. More deconstructs both these charges, but when Cromwell reads a letter from King Henry calling More a villain, More is genuinely shaken. Meeting Norfolk outside, More insists that if he wishes to remain in the king’s favor, Norfolk should cease to be his friend, since by this point it is dangerous to know a man like More. Parliament passes another act, this time requiring subjects to swear an oath to King Henry’s supremacy in England over the Church and to the validity of his divorce and remarriage. The next time we see More, he is in jail for having refused to take the oath.
 
Cromwell, Norfolk, and the Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Cranmer, interrogate More in prison, but they cannot trick him into signing the oath or divulging his opinions on the king’s behavior. As long as More refuses to talk or sign the oath, Cromwell can keep him locked up but cannot have him executed. He removes More’s books but lets his family visit, hoping that they will be able to reason with him. Though More’s daughter, Margaret, tries to convince her father he has done all he can, More refuses to relent. Alice finally sympathizes fully with More’s predicament, and, displaying their full love toward each other, they reconcile just before the jailer (the Common Man) insists that the visit is over.
 
Cromwell gives Rich the office of attorney general for Wales in exchange for Rich’s false testimony at More’s trial. Though More never opened his mouth, Rich claims he heard More deny the king’s authority over the Church. More is sentenced to death but not before he can express his disapproval of the Supremacy Act and his disappointment with a government that would kill a man for keeping quiet. More goes to his death with dignity and composure, and the play ends with his beheading."
Decrease,"In “moon,” the first of the four parts of feed, an American teenager named Titus travels to the lunar surface with his high-school friends for spring break, hoping to escape the boredom they feel on Earth. No specific date is revealed, though it’s sometime in a dystopic future, where the moon is fully commercialized and people suffer from red sores called lesions. As Titus and his fellow upper-class friends Link, Marty, Calista, Loga, and Quendy arrive on the moon, readers also get their first glimpse of “the feed.” Although Titus doesn’t initially reveal exact details about the feed or how it works, he says it sends the friends ads and images for where to stay and shop. 
After failing to get into college-age parties, the group visits the Ricochet Lounge, where Titus becomes infatuated with a girl named Violet. She is beautiful and, he soon finds, visiting the moon by herself and is very unlike his friends: She doesn’t make pointless purchases at a mall they all soon visit and isn’t interested in malfunctioning, or falling into a drug-like stupor, via their connections to the feed. Later, when they all visit a dance club called the Rumble Spot, an old man from a dissenter group called the Coalition of Pity hacks into people’s individual feeds, causing them to broadcast the signal, “we enter a time of calamity” over the feed’s network. Police beat the man and “shut off” those hacked, including Titus and Violet, who hold hands as they collapse.
Part 2, “eden,” occurs in a lunar hospital where Violet, Titus, and his friends remain disconnected from the feed until their systems can be scanned for viruses. There, Titus provides additional details about what the feed is and how it works. Feeds are implanted inside the body and connect to a global network that provides news, entertainment, and a means to purchase every kind of product, he says while singing its praises. The feed even anticipates and creates users’ wants from individual profiles based on purchasing decisions, thoughts, and feelings. Titus and Violet grow closer during the stay. Violet, who’s home-schooled and smarter than Titus and his friends, says she hoped to enjoy herself like normal kids but now has a problem, though she remains vague about what this problem is. When doctors finally restore the friends’ feeds, they rejoice. Promotions begin to flow through their minds again, though there’s also ominous news concerning protests over America’s annexation of the moon and resulting anger from a group called the Global Alliance. Still, Titus says, the friends exalt in the return of their feeds.
In Part 3, “Utopia,” Titus and his friends return to Earth and life returns to normal for them: “upcars” travel in tubes past vertically stacked suburbs, the friends party, and U.S. President Trumbull scoffs at reports that claim toxic industries cause lesions. In defiance of rampant consumerism and a loss of individuality, Violet determines to resist the feed by creating a completely random customer profile and asks Titus to join her. Violet, who didn’t receive her feed until she was seven, voices deep concern about the decline of the world and destruction of Earth, and laments how those who’ve had the feed their entire lives are ignorant and self-centered. Titus soon has nightmares that are more likely hacks from the Coalition of Pity. In them, he sees disturbing images of eco destruction and human suffering around the world, but after Violet chats him, saying she has seen the images too, he only wants to go back to sleep.
Before long, Violet’s problem becomes clear: Her body begins to fail and she’s told by doctors that the damage to her feedware can be fatal. The prognosis makes Violet realize how much she wants to do. She starts by going to the seashore with Titus, though they need to dress in protective suits due to its toxicity. Meanwhile, feed chatter reveals that all of Earth’s forests have fallen and there is a growing rift between the U.S. and the Global Alliance. At a party where Quendy shows off her artificial lesions, Violet becomes outraged and her body falters. She chastises Titus and his friends for living in ignorance as the world dies, then collapses and is brought to the hospital. 
Violet’s condition declines further in Part 4, “slumberland,” whose chapter titles track her feed efficiency from a high of 87.3 percent to a low of 4.6 percent, 98 percent being optimal. Aware that she doesn’t have much time, Violet messages Titus a list of twenty-two things she wants to do in life, though he grows increasingly distant, and doesn’t message back. When they do reconnect, Violet sends Titus a recent memory where she falls down a staircase and receives a response from the corporation FeedTech, denying her petition to pay for her system repairs because she wasn’t deemed to be worthy due to her random customer profile. Violet later sends Titus childhood memories to preserve her history, though he deletes them. And when Violet convinces him to visit the mountains with her, one of her life goals, Titus breaks up with her, saying he was only interested in a short relationship while she wanted something eternal. 
Time passes and Titus eventually hears from Violet’s father. At Violet’s home, Titus sees her lying on a floating bed, completely pale, fully incapacitated, and covered in discs. Her father details her final, painful days and how her body failed. He then berates Titus for how badly he treated Violet and for willfully living in ignorance. Titus later visits Violet’s home a second time. Although she appears dead, her feed efficiency is at 4.6 percent and a screen shows that her heart is beating slightly. Nevertheless, Titus tells Violet a story he plans to keep telling her, he says, so she will remember herself. The story is about Violet, the end of America, and their relationship, where they learn something important about love and how to resist the feed. The book ends with a promotion on the feed for Blue-Jean Warehouse’s Final Sales Event and a recurring, fading message that “Everything must go.”"
Justice,"Lawyer Bryan Stevenson gives a first-person account of his decades helping marginalized Americans who have been unfairly and harshly punished by the U.S. criminal justice system, which disproportionately targets people of color and poor people. At the heart of Just Mercy is the story of Walter McMillian, a Black man who was framed for the murder of a girl named Ronda Morrison, convicted, and sent to death row. 
Stevenson alternates chapters about Walter with his personal reflections on our country’s history with racial disparity and issues around incarceration. Stevenson highlights other groups of vulnerable people who have been victimized by the criminal justice system and shares the stories of the prisoners he has helped over the years. The book also follows the growth of Stevenson’s nonprofit law project, the Alabama-based Equal Justice Initiative (EJI), through its expansion from focusing on death row prisoners to helping people sentenced to life without parole. Stevenson chronicles how EJI becomes a significant force in criminal justice reform.
In 1983 as a law student, Stevenson discovers his life’s passion when he interns with the Georgia-based Southern Prisoners Defense Committee and meets his first death row prisoner. After graduation Stevenson accepts a job with the organization to represent poor prisoners, including those in Alabama who lack any public defender. He meets Walter McMillian on Alabama’s death row. Walter owns a successful business but also transgresses racial boundaries when he has an affair with a white woman. Soon after the affair becomes public, the woman’s friend, Ralph Myers, accuses Walter of committing the unsolved murder of Ronda Morrison, which has outraged the community. Law enforcement, including a racist sheriff and the district attorney, eagerly pounces on this accusation, overlooking Walter’s alibi and a lack of evidence. Instead, they actively force Ralph to stick with his story even when he tries to recant. They coerce other false witness testimonies, and—as revealed years later—actively suppress evidence.
After Stevenson and the team at EJI unsuccessfully appeal Walter’s conviction, they launch their own investigation of the crime and uncover new evidence. They find witnesses who can prove the witnesses against Walter lied as well as financial records that indicate that one of these witnesses was paid to give false testimony. Stevenson and his team also petition for and receive all records from Walter’s trial. However, their big break comes when they receive a phone call from Ralph, who now wants to make amends. Ralph admits to lying about Walter and says he was threatened by law enforcement. Stevenson wins a hearing for Walter where he can present his new evidence: Ralph’s testimony, which is confirmed by health care workers and other inmates, as well as recordings of the law enforcement team threatening Ralph if he doesn’t frame Walter. 
While the judge refuses to grant Walter relief, Stevenson continues the appeal process through the Alabama courts. The district attorney asks outside agents to investigate the murder for which Walter was convicted, and the investigators determine that Walter had nothing to do with the crime. Six weeks later, the court invalidates Walter’s conviction. Stevenson and the State file a joint motion to dismiss the charges, and Walter is set free.
Throughout the process, Stevenson and Walter become close friends, and Stevenson helps Walter upon his release, including filing a civil suit on his behalf and offering him a place to stay. Walter works with Stevenson to share his story, giving interviews and speaking at legal conferences, and Walter is even featured in a documentary. Unfortunately, Walter is diagnosed with advancing dementia and is forced to rely on family and eventually a nursing facility for his care. He dies in 2013. Stevenson gives a eulogy at his funeral and shares all he learned from Walter, particularly that we must extend mercy to everyone, even those who have not earned it.
Interspersed with chapters chronicling Walter’s narrative are stories of Stevenson’s other clients and work. His closeness with these prisoners and their horrifying circumstances makes Stevenson more determined to help and causes him to reflect on abstract issues that nevertheless imbue the criminal justice system, like humanity and mercy. Stevenson focuses on several categories of vulnerable people who become trapped in the system, including mentally ill prisoners, disabled prisoners, and poor women who give birth to stillborn babies. 
Stevenson and his team at EJI also become increasingly focused on juvenile offenders who are sometimes tried as adults despite their young age. These offenders may be given de facto death sentences by being sentenced to life without parole and face perilous circumstances when they are housed in adult prisons. Stevenson illustrates how these prisoners retain their own humanity while being forced to live under inhumane conditions. He also discusses some of the qualities common among these types of prisoners: They are generally poor and disproportionately people of color, and most of them lack adequate legal counsel. The juveniles have horrific backgrounds of abuse and neglect.
Stevenson and his team at EJI also work to change the legal system to offer more protection to marginalized people. Several of his cases end up before the U.S. Supreme Court, and he succeeds in winning rulings that ban as unconstitutional the conviction of children to life without parole and the execution of people deemed incompetent from dementia or neurological disease. EJI works to raise public awareness of issues surrounding unfair incarceration, produces groundbreaking reports on racial issues, and sets up programs to help formerly incarcerated people adjust to life on the outside.
Stevenson also reflects on the issues that surround the criminal justice system. His time spent with prisoners awaiting their execution makes him realize how inhumane it is to prepare another human to die. After decades of work, when Stevenson fails to prevent the execution of a man who suffers from an intellectual disability, he momentarily feels unable to continue his work. However, he realizes that he cannot help but be broken by his experiences and comes to understand that it is his own brokenness that allows him to more fully understand the need for mercy and to bring compassion to others. The book ends with Stevenson’s renewed commitment to helping others."
Give,"Starr Carter, a sixteen-year-old black girl, attends a party in her neighborhood, Garden Heights. Starr goes with Kenya, a friend with whom she shares an older half-brother, Seven. Ever since attending Williamson Prep, a primarily white school, Starr feels out of place in the Garden Heights social scene. When Kenya goes off with other friends, Starr runs into her childhood best friend, Khalil Harris, whom she hasn’t seen in a long time. Gunshots from a gang fight interrupt the party, and Khalil offers to take Starr home. While Khalil drives, he explains rapper Tupac Shakur’s idea that “Thug Life” stands for “The Hate U Give Little Infants F---- Everybody.” Soon after, a white police officer with the badge number one-fifteen pulls them over. Khalil questions the motivation for the stop, and One-Fifteen orders him out of the car and searches him. One-Fifteen commands Khalil not to move, and returns to his car. Khalil opens the door to check on Starr. One-Fifteen fatally shoots Khalil.
Starr has nightmares about the death of another childhood friend, Natasha, who died in the crossfire of a gang shooting. At school on Monday, Starr feels tense around Hailey and Chris, her white friend and boyfriend, as memories of Khalil’s death interrupt her thoughts and she realizes they don’t understand. At the urging of her uncle Carlos, a police officer, Starr goes into the police station after school with her mother, Lisa, to testify about Khalil’s shooting. Starr realizes that the officers are asking more questions about whether Khalil was a troublemaker than about the night of the shooting. She worries that justice for Khalil will not be served. At Khalil’s funeral, a lawyer and activist named April Ofrah confirms Starr’s fears when she announces that the police will not pursue legal action against One-Fifteen and invites the attendees to a rally in Khalil’s honor. Starr blames herself for the police’s inaction. King, the head of a local gang called the King Lords, also interrupts the funeral and places a gray bandana on Khalil’s casket, signifying Khalil’s membership in the King Lords. April Ofrah tells Starr to call her if she needs legal representation.
The news that the police won’t prosecute One-Fifteen leads to days of protests in Garden Heights. During this time, Maverick, Starr’s father, explains to her his interpretation of Tupac’s phrase “Thug Life.” He believes that Thug Life describes a system designed against black communities. Only by speaking out can black communities begin to break the cycle. At the Carter family’s grocery store, a teenage member of the King Lords named DeVante begs Maverick, a former King Lord, to help him leave the gang. Maverick agrees. Starr sees DeVante’s request as a chance to help someone in a similar situation as Khalil. A few days later, Maverick gets into an argument with the neighborhood barber, Mr. Lewis. Although the argument is peaceful, two police officers intervene, and when they see Maverick is Starr’s father, they push him to the ground and search him. Between this scary event and pressure from Kenya, Starr decides that she will no longer be silent.
The District Attorney calls Lisa to announce that a grand jury will hear the case against One-Fifteen and asks if Starr will testify. Starr agrees, and April Ofrah decides to represent Starr pro bono, and also find a way to get Starr a television interview. Meanwhile, DeVante tells Starr that Khalil had never been a member of the King Lords and only sold drugs for King to protect his mother, who had stolen money from King. During Starr’s television interview, she decides, against Ms. Ofrah’s advice, to talk about the truth behind Khalil’s drug dealing. Starr’s implication of King enrages him. The night before her grand jury testimony, someone throws a brick and fires a gun into the Carter household. Unsure if the culprits are the King Lords or the police, Starr almost backs out of testifying. However, she ultimately decides that Khalil needs her truth. She testifies before the grand jury.
Almost two months later, the grand jury announces their decision not to indict One-Fifteen. Starr and some of her friends get caught up in the resulting riots. As she tries to avoid the chaos, Starr stumbles upon a protest led by Ms. Ofrah. She offers Starr the megaphone, and Starr leads a chant in front of the protest. The police try to break up the protest with tear gas. Starr and her friends head to the Carter family store to get milk to help heal their eyes. A Molotov cocktail lands in the store, setting it ablaze and trapping them. Maverick arrives just in time to unlock the back door. King arrives to taunt them, proud about getting his revenge. The police arrive, and King, confident that no one will testify against him, claims ignorance. However, the neighbors rally around the Carter family and tell the police that they saw King throw the Molotov cocktail. The police arrest King. Although the grocery store is in ruins, Starr knows that the family will rebuild. She vows to continue fighting for justice on behalf of Khalil and all other black people killed at the hands of police."
Agitations,"Washington relates the story of his life from birth to late adulthood, while introducing his theory for racial uplift and using his own personal story as example. His life begins on a plantation in Franklin County, Virginia. Following Emancipation and the end of the Civil War, Washington and his family, including his mother, his stepfather, his sister, and his older brother, move to Malden, Virginia, where Washington’s stepfather secures work at a salt-furnace. The first few years out of slavery are difficult for the family, but Washington is a curious, ambitious child and pursues his desire for an education. His first glimpse of education comes from his labor at the salt-furnace. Following this, Washington receives a spelling-book from his mother and with it, masters the alphabet. When a literate Black man from Ohio arrives, he offers his services as a teacher to the town’s Black population. In this way, Washington begins to develop academically.
Eventually, a school that holds both day and night classes opens in a nearby town and Washington attends after his work each day at the salt-furnace. At work, Washington hears word of a new school for Black students called the Hampton Institute and vows to go there for his education. He continues to work to raise money to travel to Hampton, Virginia, where the school is located. He stops working at the salt-furnace and begins to work for the owner’s wife, Mrs. Ruffner, as a servant. Mrs. Ruffner teaches Washington the strictures of civilized living: order, cleanliness, promptness. Washington also begins his first personal library at this time. After a short while, Washington heads off to Hampton. On his journey to Hampton, the stage-coach that he takes to the train station in the next town stops at a hotel. The hotel-keeper refuses to give Washington a room because of his race. Washington, consequently, sleeps outside.
After this episode, Washington walks and hitches rides to Richmond, Virginia. He reaches Richmond at night and sleeps under a raised sidewalk. The next morning, he finds work loading and unloading ships. He continues to sleep under the raised sidewalk as he earns money for the rest of his trip to Hampton. When he arrives at Hampton, his general appearance and the state of his clothing make a poor first impression. The head teacher admits several students to the school ahead of him and finally asks him to sweep the room adjoining the main hall. Washington sweeps the room as thoroughly as possible and so impresses the head teacher that he is admitted to the school and offered a position as a janitor. This provides Washington with a way to pay for his room and board, as well as a portion of his tuition.
A new life begins for Washington at Hampton. Hampton introduces Washington to the dignity in hard work and labor and teaches him the value and virtue of selflessness. Both lessons will later form the foundation of Washington’s social program for racial uplift. The man who makes the strongest impression upon Washington at Hampton is the school’s founder, General Samuel C. Armstrong. Armstrong admires Washington’s selflessness and his strength of leadership. At Hampton, Washington works at his studies and is an enthusiastic participant in the school’s debating societies. Washington does not return home to Malden, Virginia, until after his second year of school.
Washington’s mother dies during this summer and the event throws his family life into disarray. Washington considers not returning to Hampton, but his desire for an education is strong. He returns to Hampton and eventually graduates. After graduation, he returns to Malden where he opens a school for the Black community. Washington’s curriculum for the school extends beyond “mere book education” to include lessons on proper grooming, personal comportment, and personal industry. In addition to teaching the school, Washington also starts a night-school, multiple debating societies, and establishes a reading room. After two years teaching in Malden, Washington goes to Washington, D.C. to further his studies. Washington eventually returns to Hampton as a teacher and his first work at the school is to teach newly admitted Native American students. The experience solidifies Washington’s beliefs in hard work and selflessness. Washington teaches the Native American students how to operate in white society as well as traditional academic subjects.
His success at Hampton leads to an invitation to head a new school in Alabama. Once Washington reaches Tuskegee, Alabama, he finds eager students but no proper building in which to hold a school. For the first few months, Washington holds the school in a shanty located near a church. Eventually, Washington purchases an old plantation for the school. Washington, alongside his students, labors to repair the buildings to make them suitable as classrooms. He also has the students plant crops to make Tuskegee self-sustaining. These early experiments in student labor become part of the foundational curriculum at Tuskegee, each student having to learn a trade or industry alongside more traditional academic subjects.
During this time, Washington makes many trips North to raise money for the school and as a result, establishes a profile as a public speaker and Black leader. Washington begins to receive invitations to speak at all manner of events. By the time he receives the invitation to deliver what will become his most famous speech at the Atlanta Cotton States and International Exposition, his views about the proper approach to racial advancement and uplift have crystallized. In his speech at the Atlanta Exposition, which will later become known as the ""Atlanta compromise,"" Washington exhorts former slaves to “cast down [their] bucket[s] where you are” and expresses opposition to political agitation. Washington also emphasizes racial intermingling only for common business interests, and otherwise says that the races “can be as separate as the fingers.” This speech catapults Washington to a new level of fame and renown, despite vocal detractors. The speech summed up Washington's belief that Black Americans could succeed and prosper through hard work and education, while not directly challenging the status quo of segregation and the loss of the voting rights that had been taken away from them Jim Crow took hold.
Washington ends the book by reflecting on the legacy of Tuskegee and his hope for the race in the coming years. He is optimistic about both because of the large distance he himself has traveled."
Powers,"At the beginning of the novel, the priest is waiting for a boat that will take him out of the capital city. He is on the run from the police because religion has been outlawed in his state and he is the last remaining clergyman. While talking to a man named Mr. Tench, he is summoned to a dying woman's house and misses his boat. He hides out in a barn on the estate of a plantation owner, befriending the owner's daughter. Forced to move on, he heads to a village in which he used to live and work as pastor. There he meets Maria, a woman with whom he has had a brief affair, and Brigida, his illegitimate daughter. He spends the night in the town and wakes before dawn to say mass for the villagers. The lieutenant—a sworn enemy of all r eligion—arrives at the end of mass, leading a group of policemen in search of the priest, and the priest goes out to the town square to face his enemy. No one in the village turns him in, however, and the lieutenant does not realize that he has foun d the man he is looking for. Instead, the lieutenant takes a hostage, whom he says he will execute if he finds that the villagers have been lying to him about the whereabouts of the wanted man.
The priest heads to the town of Carmen, and on the way he meets a man known simply as the mestizo. Uninvited, the mestizo accompanies the priest on his journey, and it very soon becomes clear that he is an untrustworthy figure, and most likely interes ted in following the priest so that he can turn him in and collect the reward money. The priest finally admits that he is, indeed, a priest. But the mestizo, who has become feverish by the second day of their journey together, does not have the strength t o follow the priest when he veers off course. The priest knows that if he enters Carmen he will surely be captured, and he lets the mestizo ride on towards the town by himself.
The priest then backtracks to the capital city. He is in disguise, wearing a drill suit, and he tries to procure a bottle of wine so he can say mass. He meets a beggar who takes him to a hotel and introduces him to a man who says he can supply him with th e wine. The man arrives and sells the priest a bottle of wine and a bottle of brandy. But, taking advantage of the priest's offer to share a drink with him, the man proceeds to drink the entire bottle of wine, thwarting the priest's plan. The priest then leaves the hotel but is caught with the bottle of brandy by a state official. After a lengthy chase through the streets of the town, during which the priest unsuccessfully attempts to take refuge at the house of Padre Jose, he is caught and taken to j ail. In jail he speaks with the prisoners, admitting to them that he is a priest. A pious woman, in jail for having religious articles in her home, argues with the priest. The next day, the priest is ordered to clean out the cells and, while doing so, meets the mestizo again. But the mestizo decides not to turn the priest in to the authorities. The priest has another face-to-face encounter with the lieutenant, but again goes unrecognized, and is allowed to go free.
The priest spends a night at the abandoned estate of the Fellows and then moves on to an abandoned village. He meets an Indian woman whose son has been shot and killed by the gringo, an American outlaw who is also on the run from police. He accompanie s the woman to a burial ground and then leaves her there. Fatigued, and almost completely drained of the will to live, the priest staggers on, eventually coming upon a man named Mr. Lehr who informs him that he is out of danger, having crossed the bor der into a neighboring state where religion is not outlawed.
After spending a few days at the home of Mr. Lehr, the priest prepares to leave for Las Casas. But before he can depart, the mestizo arrives, informing him that the gringo has been mortally wounded by the police and is asking for someone to come and hear his confession. The priest, aware that he is walking into a trap, finally agrees to accompany the mestizo back across the border. There he meets the gringo, who refuses to repent for his sins and then dies. Then, as expected, the lieutenant arrives and ta kes the priest into custody. The two men have a long conversation about their beliefs and then, when the storm front clears, the lieutenant takes the priest back to the capital city for his trial.
On the night before the priest is to be executed, the lieutenant goes to the home of Padre Jose to see if he will come and hear the confession of the captured priest. Padre Jose refuses and the lieutenant returns to the police station with a bottle of bra ndy for the priest. That night, the priest tries to repent for his sins, but finds he cannot. He wakes up the next morning afraid of the impending execution.
The next day, Mr. Tench watches the execution from the window of the jefe's office. Later that night the boy hears about what happened to the priest and realizes that the man is a martyr and a hero. He dreams about him that night, and wakes up to the sound of knocking at the door. Opening the door, he finds a man seeking shelter, and when the boy learns that the man is a priest, he swings the door wide open to let him in."
Tomb,"An imaginative and mischievous boy named Tom Sawyer lives with his Aunt Polly and his half-brother, Sid, in the Mississippi River town of St. Petersburg, Missouri. After playing hooky from school on Friday and dirtying his clothes in a fight, Tom is made to whitewash the fence as punishment on Saturday. At first, Tom is disappointed by having to forfeit his day off. However, he soon cleverly persuades his friends to trade him small treasures for the privilege of doing his work. He trades these treasures for tickets given out in Sunday school for memorizing Bible verses and uses the tickets to claim a Bible as a prize. He loses much of his glory, however, when, in response to a question to show off his knowledge, he incorrectly answers that the first two disciples were David and Goliath.
Tom falls in love with Becky Thatcher, a new girl in town, and persuades her to get “engaged” to him. Their romance collapses when she learns that Tom has been “engaged” before—to a girl named Amy Lawrence. Shortly after being shunned by Becky, Tom accompanies Huckleberry Finn, the son of the town drunk, to the graveyard at night to try out a “cure” for warts. At the graveyard, they witness the murder of young Dr. Robinson by the Native-American “half-breed” Injun Joe. Scared, Tom and Huck run away and swear a blood oath not to tell anyone what they have seen. Injun Joe blames his companion, Muff Potter, a hapless drunk, for the crime. Potter is wrongfully arrested, and Tom’s anxiety and guilt begin to grow.
Tom, Huck, and Tom’s friend Joe Harper run away to an island to become pirates. While frolicking around and enjoying their newfound freedom, the boys become aware that the community is sounding the river for their bodies. Tom sneaks back home one night to observe the commotion. After a brief moment of remorse at the suffering of his loved ones, Tom is struck by the idea of appearing at his funeral and surprising everyone. He persuades Joe and Huck to do the same. Their return is met with great rejoicing, and they become the envy and admiration of all their friends.
Back in school, Tom gets himself back in Becky’s favor after he nobly accepts the blame for a book that she has ripped. Soon Muff Potter’s trial begins, and Tom, overcome by guilt, testifies against Injun Joe. Potter is acquitted, but Injun Joe flees the courtroom through a window.
Summer arrives, and Tom and Huck go hunting for buried treasure in a haunted house. After venturing upstairs they hear a noise below. Peering through holes in the floor, they see Injun Joe enter the house disguised as a deaf and mute Spaniard. He and his companion, an unkempt man, plan to bury some stolen treasure of their own. From their hiding spot, Tom and Huck wriggle with delight at the prospect of digging it up. By an amazing coincidence, Injun Joe and his partner find a buried box of gold themselves. When they see Tom and Huck’s tools, they become suspicious that someone is sharing their hiding place and carry the gold off instead of reburying it.
Huck begins to shadow Injun Joe every night, watching for an opportunity to nab the gold. Meanwhile, Tom goes on a picnic to McDougal’s Cave with Becky and their classmates. That same night, Huck sees Injun Joe and his partner making off with a box. He follows and overhears their plans to attack the Widow Douglas, a kind resident of St. Petersburg. By running to fetch help, Huck forestalls the violence and becomes an anonymous hero.
Tom and Becky get lost in the cave, and their absence is not discovered until the following morning. The men of the town begin to search for them, but to no avail. Tom and Becky run out of food and candles and begin to weaken. The horror of the situation increases when Tom, looking for a way out of the cave, happens upon Injun Joe, who is using the cave as a hideout. Eventually, just as the searchers are giving up, Tom finds a way out. The town celebrates, and Becky’s father, Judge Thatcher, locks up the cave. Injun Joe, trapped inside, starves to death.
A week later, Tom takes Huck to the cave and they find the box of gold, the proceeds of which are invested for them. The Widow Douglas adopts Huck, and, when Huck attempts to escape civilized life, Tom promises him that if he returns to the widow, he can join Tom’s robber band. Reluctantly, Huck agrees."
Atom,"On August 6, 1945, the American army decimates the city of Hiroshima with a bomb of enormous power; out of a population of 250,000, the bomb kills nearly 100,000 people and injures 100,000 more. In its original edition, Hersey’s Hiroshima traces the lives of six survivors—two doctors, two women, and two religious men—from the moment the bomb drops until a few months later. In 1985, Hersey added a postscript that now forms the book’s fifth chapter. In this chapter, Hersey reexamines these six individuals’ lives in the forty years since the bomb.
	The Reverend Mr. Kiyoshi Tanimoto, a community leader and an American-educated Methodist pastor, is uninjured by the explosion. As fires spread around the city, he helps get people to safety at a small park on the outskirts of the city. Tanimoto is aided by Father Wilhelm Kleinsorge, a Jesuit priest. Despite his own illness, Father Kleinsorge consoles the wounded and brings water to those who need it. Many of the victims are too weak or wounded to move, and in the absence of any official help, people like Father Kleinsorge and Mr. Tanimoto are left to protect them from encroaching fires, whirlwinds, and the rising tide of the river. Among the victims they help are Mrs. Hatsuyo Nakamura and her young children.
	Miss Toshiko Sasaki is a young clerk whose leg is fractured in the blast. Her wound becomes terribly infected, and she receives no real medical help for weeks after the explosion. The bomb kills more than half the doctors in Hiroshima and injures most of the rest; Dr. Masakazu Fujii, for instance, is unable to help anybody but himself for a long while. Dr. Terufumi Sasaki, on the other hand, remains the only uninjured doctor on the staff of the Red Cross Hospital, and in the months after the explosion he barely leaves his post, trying to stem the tide of death rising around him.
	Weeks after the explosion, after Japan capitulates and Hiroshima begins to rebuild, a new terror strikes: radiation sickness. Victims become nauseated, feverish, and anemic; many people, such as Mrs. Nakamura, watch their hair fall out. The disease baffles everyone, and many, including Father Kleinsorge, never fully recover. Still, the people of Hiroshima try to return to their normal lives. In his added postscript, Hersey traces the lives of these six characters in the forty years after the atomic bomb. Father Kleinsorge and Dr. Fujii die from sudden illnesses years later. Mrs. Nakamura and Miss Sasaki scrape their way up from the bottom to become happy and successful. After working hard and supporting her family, Mrs. Nakamura lives comfortably on a pension and a government allowance, and Miss Sasaki becomes a nun. Dr. Sasaki and Mr. Tanimoto devote their lives to helping people. Mr. Tanimoto in particular plays an important role in trying to help the victims of the bomb—most notably the Hiroshima Maidens, whose burns are so bad that they require plastic surgery. He becomes a minor celebrity in America and somewhat unsuccessfully tries to spread a message of peace in a time of nuclear escalation.
	In the end, Hersey finds that the horrors of nuclear war are far from over—the citizens of Hiroshima still suffer from aftereffects, and nuclear escalation continues to threaten the entire world. Hersey also finds that these six people show, in the aftermath of the bomb and the war, remarkable feelings of good will, reconciliation, and pride."
Zealously,"Okonkwo is a wealthy and respected warrior of the Umuofia clan, a lower Nigerian tribe that is part of a consortium of nine connected villages. He is haunted by the actions of Unoka, his cowardly and spendthrift father, who died in disrepute, leaving many village debts unsettled. In response, Okonkwo became a clansman, warrior, farmer, and family provider extraordinaire. He has a twelve-year-old son named Nwoye whom he finds lazy; Okonkwo worries that Nwoye will end up a failure like Unoka.
In a settlement with a neighboring tribe, Umuofia wins a virgin and a fifteen-year-old boy. Okonkwo takes charge of the boy, Ikemefuna, and finds an ideal son in him. Nwoye likewise forms a strong attachment to the newcomer. Despite his fondness for Ikemefuna and despite the fact that the boy begins to call him “father,” Okonkwo does not let himself show any affection for him.
During the Week of Peace, Okonkwo accuses his youngest wife, Ojiugo, of negligence. He severely beats her, breaking the peace of the sacred week. He makes some sacrifices to show his repentance, but he has shocked his community irreparably.
Ikemefuna stays with Okonkwo’s family for three years. Nwoye looks up to him as an older brother and, much to Okonkwo’s pleasure, develops a more masculine attitude. One day, the locusts come to Umuofia—they will come every year for seven years before disappearing for another generation. The village excitedly collects them because they are good to eat when cooked.
Ogbuefi Ezeudu, a respected village elder, informs Okonkwo in private that the Oracle has said that Ikemefuna must be killed. He tells Okonkwo that because Ikemefuna calls him “father,” Okonkwo should not take part in the boy’s death. Okonkwo lies to Ikemefuna, telling him that they must return him to his home village. Nwoye bursts into tears.
As he walks with the men of Umuofia, Ikemefuna thinks about seeing his mother. After several hours of walking, some of Okonkwo’s clansmen attack the boy with machetes. Ikemefuna runs to Okonkwo for help. But Okonkwo, who doesn’t wish to look weak in front of his fellow tribesmen, cuts the boy down despite the Oracle’s admonishment. When Okonkwo returns home, Nwoye deduces that his friend is dead.
Okonkwo sinks into a depression, neither able to sleep nor eat. He visits his friend Obierika and begins to feel revived a bit. Okonkwo’s daughter Ezinma falls ill, but she recovers after Okonkwo gathers leaves for her medicine.
The death of Ogbuefi Ezeudu is announced to the surrounding villages by means of the ekwe, a musical instrument. Okonkwo feels guilty because the last time Ezeudu visited him was to warn him against taking part in Ikemefuna’s death. At Ogbuefi Ezeudu’s large and elaborate funeral, the men beat drums and fire their guns. Tragedy compounds upon itself when Okonkwo’s gun explodes and kills Ogbuefi Ezeudu’s sixteen-year-old son.
Because killing a clansman is a crime against the earth goddess, Okonkwo must take his family into exile for seven years in order to atone. He gathers his most valuable belongings and takes his family to his mother’s natal village, Mbanta. The men from Ogbuefi Ezeudu’s quarter burn Okonkwo’s buildings and kill his animals to cleanse the village of his sin.
Okonkwo’s kinsmen, especially his uncle, Uchendu, receive him warmly. They help him build a new compound of huts and lend him yam seeds to start a farm. Although he is bitterly disappointed at his misfortune, Okonkwo reconciles himself to life in his motherland.
During the second year of Okonkwo’s exile, Obierika brings several bags of cowries (shells used as currency) that he has made by selling Okonkwo’s yams. Obierika plans to continue to do so until Okonkwo returns to the village. Obierika also brings the bad news that Abame, another village, has been destroyed by the white man.
Soon afterward, six missionaries travel to Mbanta. Through an interpreter named Mr. Kiaga, the missionaries’ leader, Mr. Brown, speaks to the villagers. He tells them that their gods are false and that worshipping more than one God is idolatrous. But the villagers do not understand how the Holy Trinity can be accepted as one God. Although his aim is to convert the residents of Umuofia to Christianity, Mr. Brown does not allow his followers to antagonize the clan.
Mr. Brown grows ill and is soon replaced by Reverend James Smith, an intolerant and strict man. The more zealous converts are relieved to be free of Mr. Brown’s policy of restraint. One such convert, Enoch, dares to unmask an egwugwu during the annual ceremony to honor the earth deity, an act equivalent to killing an ancestral spirit. The next day, the egwugwu burn Enoch’s compound and Reverend Smith’s church to the ground.
The District Commissioner is upset by the burning of the church and requests that the leaders of Umuofia meet with him. Once they are gathered, however, the leaders are handcuffed and thrown in jail, where they suffer insults and physical abuse.
After the prisoners are released, the clansmen hold a meeting, during which five court messengers approach and order the clansmen to desist. Expecting his fellow clan members to join him in uprising, Okonkwo kills their leader with his machete. When the crowd allows the other messengers to escape, Okonkwo realizes that his clan is not willing to go to war.
When the District Commissioner arrives at Okonkwo’s compound, he finds that Okonkwo has hanged himself. Obierika and his friends lead the commissioner to the body. Obierika explains that suicide is a grave sin; thus, according to custom, none of Okonkwo’s clansmen may touch his body. The commissioner, who is writing a book about Africa, believes that the story of Okonkwo’s rebellion and death will make for an interesting paragraph or two. He has already chosen the book’s title: The Pacification of the Primitive Tribes of the Lower Niger."
Adjusting,"Lawyer Bryan Stevenson gives a first-person account of his decades helping marginalized Americans who have been unfairly and harshly punished by the U.S. criminal justice system, which disproportionately targets people of color and poor people. At the heart of Just Mercy is the story of Walter McMillian, a Black man who was framed for the murder of a girl named Ronda Morrison, convicted, and sent to death row. 
Stevenson alternates chapters about Walter with his personal reflections on our country’s history with racial disparity and issues around incarceration. Stevenson highlights other groups of vulnerable people who have been victimized by the criminal justice system and shares the stories of the prisoners he has helped over the years. The book also follows the growth of Stevenson’s nonprofit law project, the Alabama-based Equal Justice Initiative (EJI), through its expansion from focusing on death row prisoners to helping people sentenced to life without parole. Stevenson chronicles how EJI becomes a significant force in criminal justice reform.
In 1983 as a law student, Stevenson discovers his life’s passion when he interns with the Georgia-based Southern Prisoners Defense Committee and meets his first death row prisoner. After graduation Stevenson accepts a job with the organization to represent poor prisoners, including those in Alabama who lack any public defender. He meets Walter McMillian on Alabama’s death row. Walter owns a successful business but also transgresses racial boundaries when he has an affair with a white woman. Soon after the affair becomes public, the woman’s friend, Ralph Myers, accuses Walter of committing the unsolved murder of Ronda Morrison, which has outraged the community. Law enforcement, including a racist sheriff and the district attorney, eagerly pounces on this accusation, overlooking Walter’s alibi and a lack of evidence. Instead, they actively force Ralph to stick with his story even when he tries to recant. They coerce other false witness testimonies, and—as revealed years later—actively suppress evidence.
After Stevenson and the team at EJI unsuccessfully appeal Walter’s conviction, they launch their own investigation of the crime and uncover new evidence. They find witnesses who can prove the witnesses against Walter lied as well as financial records that indicate that one of these witnesses was paid to give false testimony. Stevenson and his team also petition for and receive all records from Walter’s trial. However, their big break comes when they receive a phone call from Ralph, who now wants to make amends. Ralph admits to lying about Walter and says he was threatened by law enforcement. Stevenson wins a hearing for Walter where he can present his new evidence: Ralph’s testimony, which is confirmed by health care workers and other inmates, as well as recordings of the law enforcement team threatening Ralph if he doesn’t frame Walter. 
While the judge refuses to grant Walter relief, Stevenson continues the appeal process through the Alabama courts. The district attorney asks outside agents to investigate the murder for which Walter was convicted, and the investigators determine that Walter had nothing to do with the crime. Six weeks later, the court invalidates Walter’s conviction. Stevenson and the State file a joint motion to dismiss the charges, and Walter is set free.
Throughout the process, Stevenson and Walter become close friends, and Stevenson helps Walter upon his release, including filing a civil suit on his behalf and offering him a place to stay. Walter works with Stevenson to share his story, giving interviews and speaking at legal conferences, and Walter is even featured in a documentary. Unfortunately, Walter is diagnosed with advancing dementia and is forced to rely on family and eventually a nursing facility for his care. He dies in 2013. Stevenson gives a eulogy at his funeral and shares all he learned from Walter, particularly that we must extend mercy to everyone, even those who have not earned it.
Interspersed with chapters chronicling Walter’s narrative are stories of Stevenson’s other clients and work. His closeness with these prisoners and their horrifying circumstances makes Stevenson more determined to help and causes him to reflect on abstract issues that nevertheless imbue the criminal justice system, like humanity and mercy. Stevenson focuses on several categories of vulnerable people who become trapped in the system, including mentally ill prisoners, disabled prisoners, and poor women who give birth to stillborn babies. 
Stevenson and his team at EJI also become increasingly focused on juvenile offenders who are sometimes tried as adults despite their young age. These offenders may be given de facto death sentences by being sentenced to life without parole and face perilous circumstances when they are housed in adult prisons. Stevenson illustrates how these prisoners retain their own humanity while being forced to live under inhumane conditions. He also discusses some of the qualities common among these types of prisoners: They are generally poor and disproportionately people of color, and most of them lack adequate legal counsel. The juveniles have horrific backgrounds of abuse and neglect.
Stevenson and his team at EJI also work to change the legal system to offer more protection to marginalized people. Several of his cases end up before the U.S. Supreme Court, and he succeeds in winning rulings that ban as unconstitutional the conviction of children to life without parole and the execution of people deemed incompetent from dementia or neurological disease. EJI works to raise public awareness of issues surrounding unfair incarceration, produces groundbreaking reports on racial issues, and sets up programs to help formerly incarcerated people adjust to life on the outside.
Stevenson also reflects on the issues that surround the criminal justice system. His time spent with prisoners awaiting their execution makes him realize how inhumane it is to prepare another human to die. After decades of work, when Stevenson fails to prevent the execution of a man who suffers from an intellectual disability, he momentarily feels unable to continue his work. However, he realizes that he cannot help but be broken by his experiences and comes to understand that it is his own brokenness that allows him to more fully understand the need for mercy and to bring compassion to others. The book ends with Stevenson’s renewed commitment to helping others."
Tobillions,"In the year 2045, climate change, war and poverty have ruined most of Earth’s societies. Most people find escape and relief in the OASIS, a multiplayer online game with thousands of different locations, including games, online shopping, and even a thriving school system. Most people in the world have OASIS accounts, as there are no recurring fees and it offers an escape from the real world. The creator of the OASIS, James Halliday, has left a contest that will transfer the ownership of the OASIS and its parent company to whoever finds his Easter egg. Since the company is worth billions of dollars, many users have been trying to figure out the clues that lead to Halliday’s Easter egg for years. 
In “Level One,” Wade Watts describes his adventures trying to win Halliday’s contest. He is a high school student who lives in trailer park in Oklahoma City. Since he lives in poverty and has poor social skills, he dedicates his life to being a “gunter” (egg hunter). Since the contest was announced, no one has made any meaningful progress. Gunters are OASIS users who have not given up on finding Halliday’s Easter egg. Wade’s online avatar, Parzival, and Wade’s friend Aech spend almost all of their time looking for clues. 
Wade eventually figures out the location of the Copper Key, the first step in finding Halliday’s egg. Wade also meets a fellow gunter named Art3mis. Even though she is his competition, he has a crush on her. After acquiring the key, Wade soon passes through the First Gate. Upon doing so, his avatar becomes instantly famous across the OASIS. Art3mis, Aech, and two other gunters (Daito and Shoto) soon clear the First Gate as well. Wade is contacted by the Sixers, members of the corporation IOI, who regularly employ unfair tactics to win Halliday’s contest. Wade speaks to the leader of the Sixers, Nolan Sorrento. Sorrento threatens to kill Wade in the real world. Wade does not cooperate and the trailer where Wade’s family lives is destroyed in a large explosion. Wade warns his friends, creates a fake identity, and leaves Oklahoma City.
In “Level Two,” Wade has difficulty figuring out how to get the Jade Key, the next item in his quest. He spends more time with Art3mis and eventually professes his love for her. She breaks up with him. His friends clear the Jade Key, as do the Sixers, and eventually Aech gives him a hint. Wade acquires the Jade Key, but the Sixers have already cleared the Second Gate and have acquired the Crystal Key. Shoto contacts him and tells him that the Sixers broke into Daito’s real-world apartment and killed him. Wade eventually figures out the clues to clear the Second Gate and then acquire the Crystal Key. He also figures out the location of the Third Gate, but the Sixers are ahead of him and have set up an impenetrable barrier to its location. He gives his friends explicit instructions on how to acquire the same items and begins to formulate a dangerous plan.
In “Level Three,” Wade allows himself to be captured by IOI and sent to their indentured work program as a prisoner. Since he is using his false identity, they do not know that he is Wade/Parzival. Once inside IOI, he uses hacking resources to steal evidence of their criminal activity and set up a chain of events that will allow his group to reach the Third Gate. Wade uses his computer skills and access to escape the IOI work prison. He warns his friends that the Sixers are planning to kidnap them to win the contest. He also sends all the criminal activity that he has uncovered to every news outlet.

200,"Winston Smith is a low-ranking member of the ruling Party in London, in the nation of Oceania. Everywhere Winston goes, even his own home, the Party watches him through telescreens; everywhere he looks he sees the face of the Party’s seemingly omniscient leader, a figure known only as Big Brother. The Party controls everything in Oceania, even the people’s history and language. Currently, the Party is forcing the implementation of an invented language called Newspeak, which attempts to prevent political rebellion by eliminating all words related to it. Even thinking rebellious thoughts is illegal. Such thoughtcrime is, in fact, the worst of all crimes.
As the novel opens, Winston feels frustrated by the oppression and rigid control of the Party, which prohibits free thought, sex, and any expression of individuality. Winston dislikes the party and has illegally purchased a diary in which to write his criminal thoughts. He has also become fixated on a powerful Party member named O’Brien, whom Winston believes is a secret member of the Brotherhood—the mysterious, legendary group that works to overthrow the Party.
Winston works in the Ministry of Truth, where he alters historical records to fit the needs of the Party. He notices a coworker, a beautiful dark-haired girl, staring at him, and worries that she is an informant who will turn him in for his thoughtcrime. He is troubled by the Party’s control of history: the Party claims that Oceania has always been allied with Eastasia in a war against Eurasia, but Winston seems to recall a time when this was not true. The Party also claims that Emmanuel Goldstein, the alleged leader of the Brotherhood, is the most dangerous man alive, but this does not seem plausible to Winston. Winston spends his evenings wandering through the poorest neighborhoods in London, where the proletarians, or proles, live squalid lives, relatively free of Party monitoring.
One day, Winston receives a note from the dark-haired girl that reads “I love you.” She tells him her name, Julia, and they begin a covert affair, always on the lookout for signs of Party monitoring. Eventually they rent a room above the secondhand store in the prole district where Winston bought the diary. This relationship lasts for some time. Winston is sure that they will be caught and punished sooner or later (the fatalistic Winston knows that he has been doomed since he wrote his first diary entry), while Julia is more pragmatic and optimistic. As Winston’s affair with Julia progresses, his hatred for the Party grows more and more intense. At last, he receives the message that he has been waiting for: O’Brien wants to see him.
Winston and Julia travel to O’Brien’s luxurious apartment. As a member of the powerful Inner Party (Winston belongs to the Outer Party), O’Brien leads a life of luxury that Winston can only imagine. O’Brien confirms to Winston and Julia that, like them, he hates the Party, and says that he works against it as a member of the Brotherhood. He indoctrinates Winston and Julia into the Brotherhood, and gives Winston a copy of Emmanuel Goldstein’s book, the manifesto of the Brotherhood. Winston reads the book—an amalgam of several forms of class-based twentieth-century social theory—to Julia in the room above the store. Suddenly, soldiers barge in and seize them. Mr. Charrington, the proprietor of the store, is revealed as having been a member of the Thought Police all along.
Torn away from Julia and taken to a place called the Ministry of Love, Winston finds that O’Brien, too, is a Party spy who simply pretended to be a member of the Brotherhood in order to trap Winston into committing an open act of rebellion against the Party. O’Brien spends months torturing and brainwashing Winston, who struggles to resist. At last, O’Brien sends him to the dreaded Room 101, the final destination for anyone who opposes the Party. Here, O’Brien tells Winston that he will be forced to confront his worst fear. Throughout the novel, Winston has had recurring nightmares about rats; O’Brien now straps a cage full of rats onto Winston’s head and prepares to allow the rats to eat his face. Winston snaps, pleading with O’Brien to do it to Julia, not to him.
Giving up Julia is what O’Brien wanted from Winston all along. His spirit broken, Winston is released to the outside world. He meets Julia but no longer feels anything for her. He has accepted the Party entirely and has learned to love Big Brother."
Government,"In Common Sense, Thomas Paine argues for American independence. His argument begins with more general, theoretical reflections about government and religion, then progresses onto the specifics of the colonial situation.
Paine begins by distinguishing between government and society. Society, according to Paine, is everything constructive and good that people join together to accomplish. Government, on the other hand, is an institution whose sole purpose is to protect us from our own vices. Government has its origins in the evil of man and is therefore a necessary evil at best. Paine says that government's sole purpose is to protect life, liberty and property, and that a government should be judged solely on the basis of the extent to which it accomplishes this goal.
Paine then considers an imagined scenario in which a small group of people has been placed on an island, and cut off from the rest of society. In time, these people develop ties with one another, and lawmaking becomes inevitable. Paine says the people will be much happier if they are responsible for the creation of the laws that rule them. Paine is also implicitly arguing that such a system of representation is also better for the American colonists. Having expressed his disagreement with British reign in America, Paine proceeds to launch a general attack on the British system of government. Paine says the British system is too complex and rife with contradictions, and that the monarchy is granted far too much power. The British system pretends to offer a reasonable system of checks and balances, but in fact, it does not.
From here Paine moves on to discuss, in general, the notions of monarchy and hereditary succession. Man, Pain argues, was born into a state of equality, and the distinction that has arisen between king and subject is an unnatural one. At first, Paine says, the world was without kings, but the ancient Jews decided they wanted a king. This angered God, but he allowed them to have one. Paine presents pages of biblical evidence detailing God's wrath at the idea of the Jews having a king. The conclusion Paine reaches is that the practice of monarchy originates from sin, and is an institution that the Bible and God condemn. Paine calls hereditary succession an abominable practice. He says that even if people were to choose to have a king, that does not legitimize that King's child acting as a future ruler. Furthermore, hereditary succession has brought with it innumerable evils, such as incompetent kings, corruption, and civil war.
Having dispensed with the preliminary theoretical issues, Paine sets in to discuss the details of the American situation. In response to the argument that America has flourished under British rule, and therefore ought to stay under the king, Paine says that such an argument fails to realize that America has evolved and no longer needs Britain's help. Some say that Britain has protected America, and therefore deserves allegiance, but Paine responds that Britain has only watched over America in order to secure its own economic well-being. Paine adds that most recently, instead of watching over the colonies, the British have been attacking them, and are therefore undeserving of American loyalty.
Paine says that the colonies have little to gain from remaining attached to Britain. Commerce can be better conducted with the rest of Europe, but only after America becomes independent. Paine also asserts that if the colonies remain attached to Britain, the same problems that have arisen in the past will arise in the future. Paine argues that it is necessary to seek independence now, as to do otherwise would only briefly cover up problems that will surely reemerge.
Paine even proposes the form of government that the independent colonies should adopt. His recommendation is for a representative democracy that gives roughly equal weight to each of the colonies.
Paine explains why the current time is a good time to break free of Britain. Primarily, Paine focuses on the present size of the colonies, and on their current capabilities. He presents an inventory of the British Navy and gives calculations revealing how America could build a navy of comparable size. Paine recommends this as a way of ensuring America's security and prosperity in trade. Paine also argues that America is sufficiently small as to be united now. If time were to elapse, and the population of the colonies to grow, the same feeling of unity would not be present. Paine adds that if the Americans revolt now, they can use the vast expanses of uncharted land to the West in order to pay down some of the debt they will incur.
Paine says that as a colony of Britain, America lacks respectability on the international scene. They are seen simply as rebels, and cannot form substantial alliances with other nations. In order to prosper in the long term, the colonies need to be independent. Paine says that, by declaring independence, America will be able to ask for the help of other countries in its struggle for freedom. For all of these reasons, Paine says it is imperative and urgent that the colonies declare independence."
Why,"Clay Jensen is a diligent high school student. He is close to being class valedictorian and almost always chooses to study on weekends instead of going to parties. Clay’s classmate, Hannah Baker, has recently taken her own life. After Hannah’s suicide, Clay receives a package in the mail with no return address. When he opens it, he a shoebox containing seven two-sided audio cassettes with the A and B sides numbered in sequential order.
We learn that the tapes were recorded by Hannah just prior taking her own life, and that on thirteen of the fourteen sides she described troubling events leading up to her suicide. Thirteen Reasons Why follows Clay as he travels around town, with the aid of a map that Hannah created, listening to Hannah’s voiceover as she describes the events (one per tape side) and the key individuals involved in them—all of whom Hannah holds culpable in some way for her decision to take her own life. Clay, who was not close friends with Hannah, is initially puzzled about why he was sent the tapes, but as he listens to more and more of her disturbing stories, he belatedly begins to understand that he had an important place in Hannah’s world and psyche. 
Clay listens to the first tape on an old stereo his family’s garage. He hears Hannah say that she will explain why she took her own life, but that anyone listening to the tapes is one of the reasons she did so. Hannah says that whoever receives the tapes should listen to them and then send them on to the next person listed. She warns that if anyone either tries to avoid listening to the tapes or doesn’t pass them on, a backup set of the tapes will be released. In addition to the tapes, each recipient has received a map with different places marked, so that they can travel around town to each location mentioned in Hannah’s story.
On Cassette 1, Side A, Hannah tells of dating Justin Foley, who was her first kiss. They dated for a month, but when rumors started to circulate (some of them originating with Justin), Hannah gained a reputation for being promiscuous. Hannah addresses this on the tape with the statement, “Hannah Baker is not, and never was, a slut.” Realizing he’ll need way to listen to the rest of the tapes as he travels around town, Clay goes to his friend Tony’s house to get a Walkman. 
After leaving Tony’s, Clay listens to Cassette 1, Side B. On it, Hannah discusses Alex Standall. Hannah, Alex and a girl named Jessica Davis became friends and started spending time at Monet’s, a local coffee shop. After Jessica and Alex had an unpleasant breakup, Alex made a “Who’s Hot / Who’s Not” list and passed it around school. Trying to make Jessica angry, Alex listed Hannah as “Best Ass in the Freshman Class” and listed Jessica as the worst. Shortly afterwards, a student came up behind Hannah and spanked as she was standing in line at a store. With the promiscuity rumors already circulating, Hannah believes that Alex’s list gave the student an excuse for his behavior.
Clay sits on the curb outside the store where the incident occurred and plays the next tape, Cassette 2, Side A. Hannah describes her friendship with Jessica Davis. After the “Who’s Hot / Who’s Not” list started to circulate through school, Jessica confronted Hannah, stating that the promiscuity rumors must be true, and that Hannah had been involved with Alex. Hannah tried to explain that Alex put their names on his list just to make Jessica jealous, but Jessica became angry and struck Hannah, leaving a small scar above her eyebrow. Clay takes a city bus to Monet’s and orders a coffee.
At Monet’s, Clay listens to Cassette 2, Side B. Hannah talks about a yearbook photographer, Tyler Down, who secretly took pictures of her from outside her bedroom window. Hannah asked a fellow classmate, Courtney Crimsen, to help her catch this Peeping Tom in the act. In Hannah’s room, she and Courtney talk loudly and provocatively to entice the photographer, and then run to the window and see someone who Hannah later confirms is Tyler. Hannah has recorded this tape while standing outside Tyler’s window, and she marks his address on the map so others can invade his privacy, just like he invaded hers.
While taking another bus to get to Tyler’s house, Clay sees that a fellow student, Skye Miller, is also aboard. He had a crush on her in eighth grade, but Clay says that at some point Skye stopped talking to other students. Exiting the bus, Clay sees that Tyler’s window has been broken. On Cassette 3, Side A, Hannah talks about Courtney Crimsen, who everyone assumes is a good person. Hannah gives examples of how Courtney manipulates people and is quite fake. After giving Courtney a ride to a party, she even tried to start new rumors about Hannah.
On Cassette 3, Side B, Hannah describes going on a date with Marcus Cooley at Rosie’s, a local diner. While sitting in a booth, Marcus put his hand on Hannah’s thigh. After he refused to remove his hand, Hannah shoved him out of the booth. He loudly called her a “tease” and left. 
Clay thinks about how he and Hannah used to work at the local movie theater together. He had feelings for her but couldn’t bring himself to tell her because he was worried what people would think about him given Hannah’s reputation. 
Clay walks to Rosie’s Diner. On Cassette 4, Side A, Hannah tells how Zach Dempsey interfered with her life. In Mrs. Baker’s Peer Communications class, each student had a paper bag in which other students could leave anonymous compliments. After realizing that she was no longer receiving compliments, Hannah caught Zach stealing them. Hannah understood that Zach’s actions were childish, but says that this was a time in her life when she needed encouragement. Hannah then left a note in Mrs. Baker’s paper bag requesting a class discussion topic. On the note, Hannah said that she was contemplating suicide. Hannah was hurt when many students voiced annoyance over the topic and the anonymous student who’d suggested it.
Still at Rosie’s, Clay listens to Cassette 4, Side B. Hannah talks about Ryan Shaver, the editor of a school publication called the Lost-N-Found Gazette. She and Ryan met at a poetry group and got along. Ryan published one of Hannah’s poems in the Lost-N-Found Gazette without her permission. While he did not put her name on it, some students guessed who wrote it and made fun of her. Hannah felt as though her thoughts and feelings were offered up for ridicule.
When Clay leaves the diner, Tony is waiting and tells Clay to get in his car. Tony explains that he has the second set of tapes and that he’s been making sure that everyone on the list listens to them and passes them on. 
Clay listens to Cassette 5, Side A—the tape about him. Hannah talks about the time she and Clay connected at a party, eventually kissing in an unoccupied bedroom. But Hannah, exhausted from the stress of her life, freaked out and told Clay to leave, which he did.
Tony drives through different neighborhoods while Clay listens to Cassette 5, Side B. Hannah continues her story of the party, from the moment after Clay left. While hiding in a closet, she heard Bryce Walker sexually assault Jessica Davis, who was passed out on the nearby bed. The tape is actually dedicated to Justin Foley, though, because he left Jessica in the room and let Bryce in, knowing what Bryce would do.
Disgusted by what he’s heard, Clay leaves Tony’s car and starts walking. On Cassette 6, Side A, Hannah tells of leaving the party where the assault occurred with Jenny Kurtz. While driving Hannah home, Jenny ran over a stop sign. Hannah thought that they should tell the police, but Jenny didn’t want to get in trouble, so she drove off, leaving Hannah to walk home. Later that night, there was an accident at that intersection in which a student from Hannah and Clay’s school was killed. 
Clay listens to Cassette 6, Side B, in which Hannah tells a story about giving up on herself. Late at night, Hannah walked past a house where a party was winding down. Bryce Walker asked Hannah to join him in a hot tub. Hannah knew that it was a terrible idea but stripped down to her underwear and got in anyway. Bryce put his hands in Hannah’s underwear, despite Hannah turning away from him and crying. On the tape, she states that she never told him “no,” and that she was just using him to let go of life completely. 
On Cassette 7, Side A, Clay listens to a conversation that Hannah had recorded between herself and her school guidance counselor, Mr. Porter. She tells Mr. Porter that she is considering suicide, and he tries to help her, but the conversation only angers Hannah. When she leaves his office, he doesn’t pursue her. 
The next morning, Clay mails the tapes to Jenny Kurtz, who is next on the list. When he goes to school, he sees Skye Miller, the girl from the bus who stopped talking to other people. Clay runs after her and talks to her."
Sovereignties,"On the morning of February 10, 1675, the British settlement of Lancaster, in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, is besieged by Native Americans. The attackers burn down houses and open fire on the settlers, wounding and killing several of them, and take a number of the survivors captive. Mary Rowlandson is one of the wounded, as is her youngest child, Sarah. Other members of Rowlandson’s family are killed outright. As the melee dies down, the Native Americans begin to lead their captives, including Rowlandson and her three children, from the settlement into the surrounding wilderness. At this point, Rowlandson and her two elder children are separated, but she and the youngest are allowed to remain together.
After a night spent in an abandoned town nearby, from which colonists had fled in fear of Indian attack, the captors and their captives begin to trek westward, farther into the forest. As Rowlandson and her daughter are both wounded, the journey is difficult and painful. After another day of travel, they reach an Indian settlement called Wenimesset. Here, Rowlandson meets another British captive, Robert Pepper, who wants to offer the new captives comfort. The Indians and their captives remain in Wenimesset for over a week, and during this time, Rowlandson’s wounded child becomes more ill, finally dying on February 18. By this time, Rowlandson’s original captor has sold her to a Saggamore Indian named Quannopin, who is related by marriage to King Philip. Quannopin oversees the burial of Rowlandson’s dead child, and a grieving Rowlandson visits her elder daughter (also named Mary), who she learns is also being held in Wenimesset. As she despairs over the fate of her family, her son visits her—he has been allowed to come from the nearby Indian settlement where he is being held in captivity. Meanwhile, the Indians continue to attack British towns, including Medfield, killing and looting as they go. Her captors give Rowlandson a Bible, part of the spoils of Medfield, and in it she finds comfort and hope.
After the fighting at Medfield, the Indians decide again to “remove” westward, now heading north as well. Rowlandson is again separated from her family and acquaintances. After a four-day rest in the forest, the band of Indians with whom Rowlandson is traveling begins to travel more swiftly. Rowlandson suspects that the British army must be close. They reach the Baquaug River and cross it, and the English arrive close behind. The British soldiers, however, are unable to ford the river, and the Indians and Rowlandson continue to the northwest. Rowlandson and her captors soon reach the Connecticut River, which they plan to cross in order to meet with King Philip. Here, however, are English scouts, and the Indians and Rowlandson are forced to scatter in the forest to remain undetected. Rowlandson again meets up with her son and his captors, though they must soon part ways.
After this detour, Rowlandson and the Indians cross the river, and on the other side, she meets with King Philip as planned. For some time, she remains at this settlement, sewing clothes for the Indians in return for food. The Indians, meanwhile, raid Northampton and return with spoils, including horses. Rowlandson asks to be taken to Albany on horseback, hoping that there she will be “sold” in exchange for gunpowder, but instead, the Indians prepare to take her northward and over the river once more.
After a brief sojourn at a settlement five miles north of King Philip’s abode, Rowlandson’s captors once again bring her north but then turn south again. Rowlandson hopes she’ll be returned home, but the Indians delay the journey, continuing south down the Connecticut River rather than turning east toward civilization. Indian attacks on British towns continue, and another captive, Thomas Read, joins Rowlandson’s group. From Read, Rowlandson learns that her husband is alive and well, which heartens her. Rowlandson also sees her son again, briefly. Rowlandson and her captors finally begin to move east.
They again cross the Baquaug River. Messengers meet them and report that Rowlandson must go to Wachuset, where the Indians will meet to discuss her possible return to freedom. More hopeful than she has been in some time, Rowlandson eagerly sets off toward the council’s meeting place. But the journey tires her, and she is disheartened by the sight of an injured colonist, wounded in still another Indian attack. At Wachuset, she speaks with King Philip, who promises her she’ll be free in two weeks. Nonetheless, the council continues to deliberate, asking Rowlandson how much her husband would be willing to pay them as ransom. The Indians then send a letter to Boston, stating that Rowlandson can be redeemed for twenty pounds. Meanwhile, attacks on British settlements continue, including an attack on Sudbury, after which Rowlandson must travel with her captors back into the forest.
As the Indians celebrate their victories, messengers arrive from the council, along with an Englishman named John Hoar. Rowlandson hopes she’ll be allowed to leave with Hoar, but negotiations continue for several more days. Rowlandson is finally allowed to travel back to now-abandoned Lancaster, then on to Concord, and finally to Boston. After nearly twelve weeks in the wilderness, Rowlandson is reunited with her husband. The two stay with a friend in Concord for eleven weeks, during which time Rowlandson’s sister is also released from her captivity. Rowlandson’s son and daughter are eventually returned as well. The family, together again at last, sets up a new household in Boston, where they continue to live until 1677."
Pathway,"Siddhartha, the handsome and respected son of a Brahmin, lives with his father in ancient India. Everyone in the village expects Siddhartha to be a successful Brahmin like his father. Siddhartha enjoys a near-idyllic existence with his best friend, Govinda, but he is secretly dissatisfied. He performs all the rituals of religion, and he does what religion says should bring him happiness and peace. Nonetheless, he feels something is missing. His father and the other elders have still not achieved enlightenment, and he feels that staying with them will not settle the questions he has about the nature of his existence. Siddhartha believes his father has already passed on all the wisdom their community has to offer, but he longs for something more. 
One day, a group of wandering ascetics called Samanas passes through town. They are starved and almost naked and have come to beg for food. They believe enlightenment can be reached through asceticism, a rejection of the body and physical desire. The path the Samanas preach is quite different from the one Siddhartha has been taught, and he believes it may provide some of the answers he is looking for. He decides to follow this new path. Siddhartha’s father does not want him to join the Samanas, but he cannot dissuade Siddhartha. Govinda also wants to find a path to enlightenment, and he joins Siddhartha in this new life.
	Siddhartha adjusts quickly to the ways of the Samanas because of the patience and discipline he learned in the Brahmin tradition. He learns how to free himself from the traditional trappings of life, and so loses his desire for property, clothing, sexuality, and all sustenance except that required to live. His goal is to find enlightenment by eliminating his Self, and he successfully renounces the pleasures of the world. 
Sunburned and half-starved, Siddhartha soon ceases to resemble the boy he used to be. Govinda is quick to praise the Samanas and notes the considerable moral and spiritual improvements they both have achieved since joining. Siddhartha, however, is still dissatisfied. The path of self-denial does not provide a permanent solution for him. He points out that the oldest Samanas have lived the life for many years but have yet to attain true spiritual enlightenment. The Samanas have been as unsuccessful as the Brahmins Siddhartha and Govinda left behind. At this time, Siddhartha and the other Samanas begin to hear about a new holy man named Gotama the Buddha who has attained the total spiritual enlightenment called Nirvana. Govinda convinces Siddhartha they both should leave the Samanas and seek out Gotama. Siddhartha and Govinda inform the leader of the Samanas of their decision to leave. The leader is clearly displeased, but Siddhartha silences him with an almost magical, hypnotizing gaze. 
Siddhartha and Govinda find Gotama’s camp of followers and are taken in. Siddhartha is initially pleased with Gotama, and he and Govinda are instructed in the Eightfold Path, the four main points, and other aspects of Buddhism. However, while Govinda is convinced to join Gotama and his followers, Siddhartha still has doubts. He has noticed a contradiction in Gotama’s teachings: Siddhartha questions how one can embrace the unity of all things, as the Buddha asks, if they are also being told to overcome the physical world. Siddhartha realizes Buddhism will not give him the answers he needs. Sadly, he leaves Govinda behind and begins a search for the meaning of life, the achievement of which he feels will not be dependent on religious instruction. 
	Siddhartha decides to embark on a life free from meditation and the spiritual quests he has been pursuing, and to instead learn from the pleasures of the body and the material world. In his new wanderings, Siddhartha meets a friendly ferryman, fully content with his simple life. Siddhartha crosses the ferryman’s river and comes to a city. Here, a beautiful courtesan named Kamala entrances him. He knows she would be the best one to teach him about the world of love, but Kamala will not have him unless he proves he can fit into the material world. She convinces him to take up the path of the merchant. With her help, Siddhartha soon finds employment with a merchant named Kamaswami and begins to learn the trade. While Siddhartha learns the wisdom of the business world and begins to master the skills Kamaswami teaches him, Kamala becomes his lover and teaches him what she knows about love.
	Years pass, and Siddhartha’s business acumen increases. Soon, he is a rich man and enjoys the benefits of an affluent life. He gambles, drinks, and dances, and anything that can be bought in the material world is his for the taking. Siddhartha is detached from this life, however, and he can never see it as more than a game. He doesn’t care if he wins or loses this game because it doesn’t touch his spirit in any lasting way. The more he obtains in the material world, the less it satisfies him, and he is soon caught in a cycle of unhappiness that he tries to escape by engaging in even more gambling, drinking, and sex. When he is at his most disillusioned, he dreams that Kamala’s rare songbird is dead in its cage. He understands that the material world is slowly killing him without providing him with the enlightenment for which he has been searching. One night, he resolves to leave it all behind and departs without notifying either Kamala or Kamaswami. 
Sick at heart, Siddhartha wanders until he finds a river. He considers drowning himself, but he instead falls asleep on the riverbank. While he is sleeping, Govinda, who is now a Buddhist monk, passes by. Not recognizing Siddhartha, he watches over the sleeping man to protect him from snakes. Siddhartha immediately recognizes Govinda when he wakes up, but Govinda notes that Siddhartha has changed significantly from his days with the Samanas and now appears to be a rich man. Siddhartha responds that he is currently neither a Samana nor a rich man. Siddhartha wishes to become someone new. Govinda soon leaves to continue on his journey, and Siddhartha sits by the river and considers where his life has taken him. 
	Siddhartha seeks out the same content ferryman he met years before. The ferryman, who introduces himself as Vasudeva, radiates an inner peace that Siddhartha wishes to attain. Vasudeva says he himself has attained this sense of peace through many years of studying the river. Siddhartha expresses a desire to likewise learn from the river, and Vasudeva agrees to let Siddhartha live and work beside him. Siddhartha studies the river and begins to take from it a spiritual enlightenment unlike any he has ever known. While sitting by the river, he contemplates the unity of all life, and in the river’s voice he hears the word Om. 

	One day Kamala the courtesan approaches the ferry along with her son on a pilgrimage to visit Gotama, who is said to be dying. Before they can cross, a snake bites Kamala. Siddhartha and Vasudeva tend to Kamala, but the bite kills her. Before she dies, she tells Siddhartha that he is the father of her eleven-year-old son. Siddhartha does his best to console and provide for his son, but the boy is spoiled and cynical. Siddhartha’s son dislikes life with the two ferrymen and wishes to return to his familiar city and wealth. Vasudeva believes Siddhartha’s son should be allowed to leave if he wants to, but Siddhartha is not ready to let him go. One morning, Siddhartha awakens to find his son has run away and stolen all of his and Vasudeva’s money. Siddhartha chases after the boy, but as he reaches the city he realizes the chase is futile. Vasudeva follows Siddhartha and brings him back to their home by the river, instructing him to soothe the pain of losing his son by listening to the river.
	Siddhartha studies the river for many years, and Vasudeva teaches Siddhartha how to learn the many secrets the river has to tell. In contemplating the river, Siddhartha has a revelation: Just as the water of the river flows into the ocean and is returned by rain, all forms of life are interconnected in a cycle without beginning or end. Birth and death are all part of a timeless unity. Life and death, joy and sorrow, good and evil are all parts of the whole and are necessary to understand the meaning of life. By the time Siddhartha has learned all the river’s lessons, Vasudeva announces that he is through with his life at the river. He retires into the forest, leaving Siddhartha to be the ferryman.
	The novel ends with Govinda returning to the river to seek enlightenment by meeting with a wise man who lives there. When Govinda arrives, he does not recognize that the wise man is Siddhartha himself. Govinda is still a follower of Gotama but has yet to attain the kind of enlightenment that Siddhartha now radiates, and he asks Siddhartha to teach him what he knows. Siddhartha explains that neither he nor anyone can teach the wisdom to Govinda, because verbal explanations are limited and can never communicate the entirety of enlightenment. Instead, he asks Govinda to kiss him on the forehead, and when Govinda does, the vision of unity that Siddhartha has experienced is communicated instantly to Govinda. Govinda and Siddhartha have both finally achieved the enlightenment they set out to find in the days of their youth."
Ripped,"An introduction explains that this tale was found among the papers of a man named Diedrich Knickerbocker, a historian of the Dutch settlers of New York. Knickerbocker, however, was less interested in getting his history from books than from other people's stories. The narrator insists that Knickerbocker's greatest attribute was his accuracy, and that the truth of the story to come is assured.  
Rip Van Winkle lives in a small Dutch village along the Hudson River in the shadow of the Catskill Mountains (spelled here Kaatskill). Rip is a good-natured man, though inclined to avoid work. His wife considers him a terrible husband, yet he is beloved throughout the village. He does odd jobs for others and plays games with the children. He is attentive to everyone else's business but his own, which frustrates his wife constantly. His small farm is chaotic and poorly managed, and the soil produces less and less yearly. The state of his children reflects his general disinterest in taking care of his own responsibilities, and his son looks to be inheriting his father's traits.  
Rip’s idleness is mirrored in both his dog, Wolf, and the company he keeps at the village inn, where other men sit and chat about the issues of the day without much enthusiasm. The schoolmaster, Derrick Van Bummel, reads whatever news comes their way and the landlord of the inn, Nicholas Vedder, steers opinion through his pipe smoke exhalations.  
One evening, Rip rests in the wilderness after squirrel hunting with his dog. He sees a stranger, dressed in old-fashioned Dutch clothes, climbing the hill toward Rip and lugging a keg on his shoulder. The stranger gestures to Rip to help, which Rip does, though stunned by the man’s appearance. Hearing what he believes is thunder, Rip follows the stranger through a ravine into a hollow, where he sees more strange-looking men dressed in similarly outdated clothing joylessly playing a kind of bowling called nine-pins. They remind Rip of a painting of old Flemish men belonging to the village parson. The sound that Rip believed to be thunder turns out to be the sound of the balls being rolled toward the pins. The players stop playing at his approach and fill their cups with liquor from the keg. They drink and return to their game, even as Rip is awed and unnerved by their appearance. Eventually, Rip tries the liquor and finds it to his liking. After more than a few drinks, he falls asleep. 
Upon waking, Rip finds himself where he first saw the man with the keg. He worries that he has slept there all night and anticipates a scolding from his wife. He notices that his well-loved gun is gone, and in its place are the rusted, ruined pieces of what was once a rifle. Unable to call his dog to him, he is determined to revisit the scene of the previous evening's encounter. Stiff upon rising, he wanders through the woods again, but the way is blocked, and he can’t find the hollow. Unhappy about losing his dog and the prospect of seeing his wife again, he heads home. 
Arriving back in his village, he notes that people are wearing a different style of clothing than he is used to, and those who acknowledge him all seem to stroke their chins. Stroking his own, Rip finds a foot-long grey beard. As he moves through the village, he finds it altered: bigger, more populated, full of children he doesn't know and names he doesn't recognize over doors and on businesses. He begins to fear that the drink has confused him to the extent that he can't recognize his own village or is somehow in a different village. Making his way to his house, he finds it in ruins with a strange dog skulking around that growls at him. The house is empty, and it appears as though no one has lived there for quite some time.  
Hoping to find some remnant of familiarity, he goes to the inn, but even that is altered. It is now The Union Hotel, with a flagpole replacing the large tree that stood outside the inn he frequented. The flag that flies atop the flagpole is an American flag, and the portrait on the inn of King George has been replaced with a portrait of George Washington. Instead of the group of idle men lounging outside the door, there is a bustling crowd, including one man talking loudly about political concerns, of which Rip understands nothing. 
Rip's strange appearance and unfamiliarity draw attention from the crowd. As they inquire about which side he voted for in the election, Rip has no idea what anyone is talking about. One man, seeing Rip's old rifle, accuses Rip of planning to stir up trouble. When Rip, flustered, cries that he is just a simple man, an inhabitant of the village, and loyal to the king, there is an uproar that takes some time to settle down. When Rip finally asks after his friends at the tavern, he is told of their fates: two dead, one in congress. It is also revealed that Nicholas Vedder has been dead for 18 years, indicating Rip has been gone for at least that long. Dismayed, Rip asks if anyone knows Rip Van Winkle. A few in the crowd point out a young man, and as Rip considers him, he realizes that this young man looks just like him at the age he fell asleep. Someone asks what his name is, and he is at a loss, confused by this twin version of himself, his age, and the changed world around him.  
At this, the crowd begins to believe that this old man has lost his wits, before a young woman is heard shushing her baby, whose name is apparently Rip. When asked her name and her father's name, it is revealed that she is Rip's daughter, and she explains that he disappeared 20 years ago and hasn't been seen since. When asked, she tells Rip that Dame Van Winkle recently died. Rip exclaims that he is her father, and then looks around to ask if anyone remembers him. An elderly woman recognizes him by name, and asks about his prolonged absence. As Rip tells his story, the crowd is skeptical. The village, however, agrees to let Peter Vanderdonk decide whether or not the story is reasonable. Vanderdonk is the oldest person in the village and knows the history of the area as well as the folklore. He describes the surrounding mountains as being inhabited by strange creatures. He also claims that Hendrick (Henry) Hudson and his crew, legendary explorers of the area, come back every 20 years to visit and make sure the land is still in good order. In fact, Vanderdonk's father had once seen them, dressed in their old-fashioned clothing, playing nine-pins. Vanderdonk himself says that he once heard the thundering of their bowling balls one summer afternoon. This wise testimony seems to validate Rip's story in the eyes of the townspeople. 
Rip moves in with his daughter and her husband, whom Rip recognizes as one of the children he used to play with in his youth. He resumes his idle ways, now old enough to do so without criticism. He takes walks and sits outside the hotel, telling stories about the time before the war and learning more about how the world has changed in his absence. Soon, everyone in town knows the tale by heart.  
A note appended to the end of the story comes from Knickerbocker insisting that every word of the story is true. He has spoken to Rip Van Winkle himself and seen a document verifying the veracity of the story, so the reader has no reason whatsoever to doubt it. 
A postscript is included, supposedly from notes made by Knickerbocker about the indigenous folklore of the region concerning both the spirits that manifest the weather and those that live in the Catskill Mountains."
Santo,"The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao recounts the life of the title character, whose real name is Oscar de León. Oscar is a Dominican-American who grew up in Paterson, New Jersey, and struggled his whole life to find community, a sense of identity, and, above all, love. Yunior, who was Oscar’s college roommate, serves as the novel’s primary narrator. Interspersed throughout the account of Oscar’s life, Yunior recounts stories of how Oscar’s mother and grandfather suffered under the regime of the Dominican dictator, Trujillo.
Yunior prefaces his biography of Oscar with a description of the legendary fukú curse that originated in Africa and arrived in the Caribbean when Spanish colonists transported slaves across the Atlantic. The curse has allegedly haunted the New World ever since. The story Yunior plans to tell is, he thinks, a fukú story.
The novel’s first chapter tells of Oscar’s early years. Oscar exhibited charm and swagger as a young boy. At age seven, however, after his attempt to date two girls simultaneously went awry, Oscar’s mental health started to suffer. Puberty wreaked havoc on his body and self-confidence. Throughout high school he felt increasingly isolated and depressed, yet his desire for love only grew stronger. He fell hopelessly in love with a young woman he met in an SAT prep class but suffered intense heartbreak when she rejected him for her older, abusive boyfriend. Dispirited, Oscar left home to start school at Rutgers University.
Oscar’s sister, Lola, narrates the novel’s second chapter. She recounts the tense relationship she had with her mother as she struggled to find herself during her teenage years. After her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer, Lola’s anger and grief sent her into a rebellious downward spiral. She shaved her head, and when the environment at home got too intense, she ran away to live near the Jersey Shore with her boyfriend, Aldo. Life with Aldo and his racist father drained Lola emotionally. She called Oscar and told him to meet her with money. She planned to run away and hoped he would come with her. But Oscar brought along their mother, Beli, who guilted Lola into coming home. As punishment, Lola was sent to live in the Dominican Republic with her grandmother, La Inca. Lola thrived there, and one night, La Inca told her the story of her mother’s youth.
Like Lola, Beli had a rebellious adolescence. Her parents died when she was young, and La Inca, who is actually her father’s cousin, looked after her. La Inca sent Beli to a good private school, but Beli showed more interest in boys than academics. After puberty transformed her body, Beli realized the power she had over men. She avidly pursued a light-skinned boy named Jack Pujols, but a scandal ensued when they were discovered having sex in a broom closet. Jack’s family disapproved of Beli’s dark skin and working-class status. Later, at a club, Beli met a man known as “the Gangster,” who worked for the Dominican dictator, Trujillo. Beli started dating the Gangster without knowing that he was already married to Trujillo’s sister. When the Gangster’s wife found out that Beli was pregnant with her husband’s child, she sent men to beat her to death in a cane field. Beli survived but lost her baby. Fearing for Beli’s life, La Inca sent her to live in New York.
Oscar remained an outcast in college. Yunior offered to move in with Oscar to impress Lola. Though initially taken aback by Oscar’s strangeness, Yunior befriended him. Darkness descended when Oscar fell in love with a student named Jenni. Oscar felt betrayed when he found her sleeping with someone else and attempted suicide by jumping off a bridge. Though physically broken, he survived and embarked on an ambitious writing project that he hoped would make him “the Dominican Tolkien.”
Yunior’s narrative again moves back in time to recount the story of Oscar’s grandfather, Abelard Luis Cabral. Abelard was a respected surgeon in the Dominican Republic. He ran a clinic with his wife, Socorro, with whom he had two daughters. His eldest daughter, Jacquelyn, possessed great beauty. Trujillo had a reputation for raping young women, and Abelard worried that he would do the same to Jacquelyn. Abelard was arrested for an alleged joke that slandered Trujillo, and his arrest proved disastrous for the family. Socorro, who was pregnant with their third child at the time of the arrest, gave birth to another daughter and then committed suicide. The older two daughters both died under mysterious circumstances. The youngest daughter, Beli, was passed to distant relatives who sold her into slavery. La Inca eventually tracked Beli down and adopted her.
Oscar graduated from Rutgers and started teaching at his old high school. Over the next three years, his life grew increasingly formulaic and depressing. One summer, he traveled with his family to Santo Domingo, where he met a semi-retired prostitute ten years his senior named Ybón Pimentel. True to his character, Oscar fell head over heels in love with her despite the fact that she already had a boyfriend: a cop Yunior refers to only as “the Capitán.” The Capitán learned about Oscar and became jealous. One day, when he witnessed Oscar kissing Ybón (Oscar’s first kiss ever), the Capitán had his henchmen take Oscar to a cane field and beat him.
Oscar survived the attack and returned to New Jersey, but he couldn’t stop thinking about Ybón and returned to Santo Domingo the first chance he got. Ybón begged him to leave, as did his family, but Oscar refused. Eventually the Capitán caught wind of Oscar’s presence. He had his henchmen kidnap Oscar again and take him back to the cane field, where they executed him.
Beli died not long after Oscar’s funeral. Lola broke up with Yunior, who had continued to cheat on her. She moved to Miami and had a baby with another man, but later moved back to New Jersey. Yunior imagined that her daughter, Isis, might one day put an end to the family curse."
Existing,"Guy Montag is a fireman who burns books in a futuristic American city. In Montag’s world, firemen start fires rather than putting them out. The people in this society do not read books, enjoy nature, spend time by themselves, think independently, or have meaningful conversations. Instead, they drive very fast, watch excessive amounts of television on wall-size sets, and listen to the radio on “Seashell Radio” sets attached to their ears.
Montag encounters a gentle seventeen-year-old girl named Clarisse McClellan, who opens his eyes to the emptiness of his life with her innocently penetrating questions and her unusual love of people and nature. Over the next few days, Montag experiences a series of disturbing events. First, his wife, Mildred, attempts suicide by swallowing a bottle of sleeping pills. Then, when he responds to an alarm that an old woman has a stash of hidden literature, the woman shocks him by choosing to be burned alive along with her books. A few days later, he hears that Clarisse has been killed by a speeding car. Montag’s dissatisfaction with his life increases, and he begins to search for a solution in a stash of books that he has stolen from his own fires and hidden inside an air-conditioning vent.
When Montag fails to show up for work, his fire chief, Beatty, pays a visit to his house. Beatty explains that it’s normal for a fireman to go through a phase of wondering what books have to offer, and he delivers a dizzying monologue explaining how books came to be banned in the first place. According to Beatty, special-interest groups and other “minorities” objected to books that offended them. Soon, books all began to look the same, as writers tried to avoid offending anybody. This was not enough, however, and society as a whole decided to simply burn books rather than permit conflicting opinions. Beatty tells Montag to take twenty-four hours or so to see if his stolen books contain anything worthwhile and then turn them in for incineration. Montag begins a long and frenzied night of reading.
Overwhelmed by the task of reading, Montag looks to his wife for help and support, but she prefers television to her husband’s company and cannot understand why he would want to take the terrible risk of reading books. He remembers that he once met a retired English professor named Faber sitting in a park, and he decides that this man might be able to help him understand what he reads. He visits Faber, who tells him that the value of books lies in the detailed awareness of life that they contain. Faber says that Montag needs not only books but also the leisure to read them and the freedom to act upon their ideas.
Faber agrees to help Montag with his reading, and they concoct a risky scheme to overthrow the status quo. Faber will contact a printer and begin reproducing books, and Montag will plant books in the homes of firemen to discredit the profession and to destroy the machinery of censorship. Faber gives him a two-way radio earpiece (the “green bullet”) so that he can hear what Montag hears and talk to him secretly.
Montag goes home, and soon two of his wife’s friends arrive to watch television. The women discuss their families and the war that is about to be declared in an extremely frivolous manner. Their superficiality angers him, and he takes out a book of poetry and reads “Dover Beach” by Matthew Arnold. Faber buzzes in his ear for him to be quiet, and Mildred tries to explain that the poetry reading is a standard way for firemen to demonstrate the uselessness of literature. The women are extremely disturbed by the poem and leave to file a complaint against Montag.
Montag goes to the fire station and hands over one of his books to Beatty. Beatty confuses Montag by barraging him with contradictory quotations from great books. Beatty exploits these contradictions to show that literature is morbid and dangerously complex, and that it deserves incineration. Suddenly, the alarm sounds, and they rush off to answer the call, only to find that the alarm is at Montag’s own house. Mildred gets into a cab with her suitcase, and Montag realizes that his own wife has betrayed him.
Beatty forces Montag to burn the house himself; when he is done, Beatty places him under arrest. When Beatty continues to berate Montag, Montag turns the flamethrower on his superior and proceeds to burn him to ashes. Montag knocks the other firemen unconscious and runs. The Mechanical Hound, a monstrous machine that Beatty has set to attack Montag, pounces and injects Montag’s leg with a large dose of anesthetic. Montag manages to destroy it with his flamethrower; then he walks off the numbness in his leg and escapes with some books that were hidden in his backyard. He hides these in another fireman’s house and calls in an alarm from a pay phone.
Montag goes to Faber’s house, where he learns that a new Hound has been put on his trail, along with several helicopters and a television crew. Faber tells Montag that he is leaving for St. Louis to see a retired printer who may be able to help them. Montag gives Faber some money and tells him how to remove Montag’s scent from his house so the Hound will not enter it. Montag then takes some of Faber’s old clothes and runs off toward the river. The whole city watches as the chase unfolds on TV, but Montag manages to escape in the river and change into Faber’s clothes to disguise his scent. He drifts downstream into the country and follows a set of abandoned railroad tracks until he finds a group of renegade intellectuals (“the Book People”), led by a man named Granger, who welcome him. They are a part of a nationwide network of book lovers who have memorized many great works of literature and philosophy. They hope that they may be of some help to mankind in the aftermath of the war that has just been declared. Montag’s role is to memorize the Book of Ecclesiastes. Enemy jets appear in the sky and completely obliterate the city with bombs. Montag and his new friends move on to search for survivors and rebuild civilization."
Local,"Winesburg, Ohio begins with a sort of prologue, in which an old writer imagines all the people he has known as ""grotesques,"" warped in their pursuits of various truths. A series of stories ensues, each concerned with a single resident of Winesburg. The first, entitled ""Hands,"" describes Wing Biddlebaum, a recluse with remarkable hands that he cannot control, who has fled from false accusations of molesting a boy in another town. The second, ""Paper Pills,"" is about Doctor Reefy, an aging medical man who marries one of his young patients, only to have her die six months later. In the third, ""Mother,"" we meet Elizabeth Willard, the mother of the book's central character, George Willard, who is a young reporter for the local paper. Elizabeth is a sick woman, trapped in an unhappy marriage, and she imagines herself locked in a struggle with her husband for influence over George.
In the next story, ""The Philosopher,"" the eccentric Doctor Parcival imagines that a lynch mob is after him, and tells George Willard the secret of life: ""Everyone in the world is Christ and they are all crucified."" In ""Nobody Knows,"" George goes out into the fields and sleeps with a girl named Louise Trunnion, only to feel guilty about it afterward. The next four stories, all lumped under the heading ""Godliness,"" depict Jesse Bentley, a wealthy farmer who imagines himself a Biblical figure chosen by God. His daughter, Louise Bentley, receives no love from him, and stumbles into a loveless marriage. Her son, David Hardy, is sent to live with his grandfather on the old man's farm, and Jesse takes the boy out into the forest in search of a message from God. He finds no message, however, and succeeds only in traumatizing the boy so much that David runs away from Winesburg forever.
In ""A Man of Ideas,"" the next story, a talkative man named Joe Welling successfully courts a woman whose father and brother are notorious thugs. The following story, ""Adventure,"" depicts the loneliness of Alice Hindman, an unmarried woman whose true love (as she considers him) left Winesburg years ago and has never returned. ""Respectability"" portrays Wash Williams, the filthy, ugly telegraph operator in Winesburg who despises women because of his wife's infidelity and his mother-in-law's treachery.

At the end of a long evening with Helen White, the daughter of the Winesburg banker, he tells her that he plans to leave town for good.
""Tandy"" tells the story of a little girl named Tandy Hard whose first name comes from a drunken man's description of the perfect woman. In ""The Strength of God,"" a minister named Curtis Hartman is tempted into lust by the sight of Kate Swift, a local schoolteacher. His temptation passes when he sees her, one snowy night, praying naked. ""The Teacher"" takes place on the same night, and depicts Kate Smith's attraction to George Willard--her simultaneous desires to teach and embrace him--and her sudden guilty flight from his office, which leaves him confused. ""Loneliness"" details Enoch Robinson's move from Winesburg to New York, where he populates his apartment with imaginary friends, only to have them move out when he tries to tell his female neighbor about them.
In ""An Awakening,"" George Willard goes out walking one night and has what he thinks is an epiphany. He tries to tell Belle Carpenter, the girl he has been seeing, about it, but another one of her suitors beats him up, and the magic of the evening slips away. ""Queer"" depicts the resentment that Elmer Cowley, the son of a store owner, feels toward Winesburg and George Willard because he thinks that the town considers his family to be odd. The story ends with Elmer beating up George and hopping a train out of town. In ""The Untold Lie,"" a farmhand named Hal Winters asks another farmhand named Ray Pearson for advice about whether to get married, causing Ray to reflect on his marriage, which he does with disgust. ""Drink"" portrays a genial, happy young man named Tom Foster and his first experience with drunkenness.
In ""Death,"" Elizabeth Willard and Doctor Reefy spend time together and begin to fall in love, as she slips toward death. She dies, finally, and George decides to quit Winesburg forever. In ""Sophistication,"" he and Helen White go out walking together on the night of the county fair, and run around like children as evening falls on Winesburg. Both are moving on from their small town, as Helen is going to college, and in the final story, ""Departure,"" George Willard boards a train and leaves Winesburg for good, letting his life there ""become but a background on which to paint the dreams of his manhood."""
With,"Jack Worthing, the play’s protagonist, is a pillar of the community in Hertfordshire, where he is guardian to Cecily Cardew, the pretty, eighteen-year-old granddaughter of the late Thomas Cardew, who found and adopted Jack when he was a baby. In Hertfordshire, Jack has responsibilities: he is a major landowner and justice of the peace, with tenants, farmers, and a number of servants and other employees all dependent on him. For years, he has also pretended to have an irresponsible black-sheep brother named Ernest who leads a scandalous life in pursuit of pleasure and is always getting into trouble of a sort that requires Jack to rush grimly off to his assistance. In fact, Ernest is merely Jack’s alibi, a phantom that allows him to disappear for days at a time and do as he likes. No one but Jack knows that he himself is Ernest. Ernest is the name Jack goes by in London, which is where he really goes on these occasions—probably to pursue the very sort of behavior he pretends to disapprove of in his imaginary brother.
Jack is in love with Gwendolen Fairfax, the cousin of his best friend, Algernon Moncrieff. When the play opens, Algernon, who knows Jack as Ernest, has begun to suspect something, having found an inscription inside Jack’s cigarette case addressed to “Uncle Jack” from someone who refers to herself as “little Cecily.” Algernon suspects that Jack may be leading a double life, a practice he seems to regard as commonplace and indispensable to modern life. He calls a person who leads a double life a “Bunburyist,” after a nonexistent friend he pretends to have, a chronic invalid named Bunbury, to whose deathbed he is forever being summoned whenever he wants to get out of some tiresome social obligation.
At the beginning of Act 1, Jack drops in unexpectedly on Algernon and announces that he intends to propose to Gwendolen. Algernon confronts him with the cigarette case and forces him to come clean, demanding to know who “Jack” and “Cecily” are. Jack confesses that his name isn’t really Ernest and that Cecily is his ward, a responsibility imposed on him by his adoptive father’s will. Jack also tells Algernon about his fictional brother. Jack says he’s been thinking of killing off this fake brother, since Cecily has been showing too active an interest in him. Without meaning to, Jack describes Cecily in terms that catch Algernon’s attention and make him even more interested in her than he is already.
Gwendolen and her mother, Lady Bracknell, arrive, which gives Jack an opportunity to propose to Gwendolen. Jack is delighted to discover that Gwendolen returns his affections, but he is alarmed to learn that Gwendolen is fixated on the name Ernest, which she says “inspires absolute confidence.” Gwendolen makes clear that she would not consider marrying a man who was not named Ernest.
Lady Bracknell interviews Jack to determine his eligibility as a possible son-in-law, and during this interview she asks about his family background. When Jack explains that he has no idea who his parents were and that he was found, by the man who adopted him, in a handbag in the cloakroom at Victoria Station, Lady Bracknell is scandalized. She forbids the match between Jack and Gwendolen and sweeps out of the house.
In Act 2, Algernon shows up at Jack’s country estate posing as Jack’s brother Ernest. Meanwhile, Jack, having decided that Ernest has outlived his usefulness, arrives home in deep mourning, full of a story about Ernest having died suddenly in Paris. He is enraged to find Algernon there masquerading as Ernest but has to go along with the charade. If he doesn’t, his own lies and deceptions will be revealed.
While Jack changes out of his mourning clothes, Algernon, who has fallen hopelessly in love with Cecily, asks her to marry him. He is surprised to discover that Cecily already considers that they are engaged, and he is charmed when she reveals that her fascination with “Uncle Jack’s brother” led her to invent an elaborate romance between herself and him several months ago. Algernon is less enchanted to learn that part of Cecily’s interest in him derives from the name Ernest, which, unconsciously echoing Gwendolen, she says “inspires absolute confidence.”
Algernon goes off in search of Dr. Chasuble, the local rector, to see about getting himself christened Ernest. Meanwhile, Gwendolen arrives, having decided to pay Jack an unexpected visit. Gwendolen is shown into the garden, where Cecily orders tea and attempts to play hostess. Cecily has no idea how Gwendolen figures into Jack’s life, and Gwendolen, for her part, has no idea who Cecily is. Gwendolen initially thinks Cecily is a visitor to the Manor House and is disconcerted to learn that Cecily is “Mr. Worthing’s ward.” She notes that Ernest has never mentioned having a ward, and Cecily explains that it is not Ernest Worthing who is her guardian but his brother Jack and, in fact, that she is engaged to be married to Ernest Worthing. Gwendolen points out that this is impossible as she herself is engaged to Ernest Worthing. The tea party degenerates into a war of manners.
Jack and Algernon arrive toward the climax of this confrontation, each having separately made arrangements with Dr. Chasuble to be christened Ernest later that day. Each of the young ladies points out that the other has been deceived: Cecily informs Gwendolen that her fiancé is really named Jack and Gwendolen informs Cecily that hers is really called Algernon. The two women demand to know where Jack’s brother Ernest is, since both of them are engaged to be married to him. Jack is forced to admit that he has no brother and that Ernest is a complete fiction. Both women are shocked and furious, and they retire to the house arm in arm.
Act 3 takes place in the drawing room of the Manor House, where Cecily and Gwendolen have retired. When Jack and Algernon enter from the garden, the two women confront them. Cecily asks Algernon why he pretended to be her guardian’s brother. Algernon tells her he did it in order to meet her. Gwendolen asks Jack whether he pretended to have a brother in order to come into London to see her as often as possible, and she interprets his evasive reply as an affirmation. The women are somewhat appeased but still concerned over the issue of the name. However, when Jack and Algernon tell Gwendolen and Cecily that they have both made arrangements to be christened Ernest that afternoon, all is forgiven and the two pairs of lovers embrace. At this moment, Lady Bracknell’s arrival is announced.
Lady Bracknell has followed Gwendolen from London, having bribed Gwendolen’s maid to reveal her destination. She demands to know what is going on. Gwendolen again informs Lady Bracknell of her engagement to Jack, and Lady Bracknell reiterates that a union between them is out of the question. Algernon tells Lady Bracknell of his engagement to Cecily, prompting her to inspect Cecily and inquire into her social connections, which she does in a routine and patronizing manner that infuriates Jack. He replies to all her questions with a mixture of civility and sarcasm, withholding until the last possible moment the information that Cecily is actually worth a great deal of money and stands to inherit still more when she comes of age. At this, Lady Bracknell becomes genuinely interested.
Jack informs Lady Bracknell that, as Cecily’s legal guardian, he refuses to give his consent to her union with Algernon. Lady Bracknell suggests that the two young people simply wait until Cecily comes of age, and Jack points out that under the terms of her grandfather’s will, Cecily does not legally come of age until she is thirty-five. Lady Bracknell asks Jack to reconsider, and he points out that the matter is entirely in her own hands. As soon as she consents to his marriage to Gwendolen, Cecily can have his consent to marry Algernon. However, Lady Bracknell refuses to entertain the notion. She and Gwendolen are on the point of leaving when Dr. Chasuble arrives and happens to mention Cecily’s governess, Miss Prism. At this, Lady Bracknell starts and asks that Miss Prism be sent for.
When the governess arrives and catches sight of Lady Bracknell, she begins to look guilty and furtive. Lady Bracknell accuses her of having left her sister’s house twenty-eight years before with a baby and never returned. She demands to know where the baby is. Miss Prism confesses she doesn’t know, explaining that she lost the baby, having absentmindedly placed it in a handbag in which she had meant to place the manuscript for a novel she had written. Jack asks what happened to the bag, and Miss Prism says she left it in the cloakroom of a railway station. Jack presses her for further details and goes racing offstage, returning a few moments later with a large handbag. When Miss Prism confirms that the bag is hers, Jack throws himself on her with a cry of “Mother!” It takes a while before the situation is sorted out, but before too long we understand that Jack is not the illegitimate child of Miss Prism but the legitimate child of Lady Bracknell’s sister and, therefore, Algernon’s older brother. Furthermore, Jack had been originally christened “Ernest John.” All these years Jack has unwittingly been telling the truth: Ernest is his name, as is Jack, and he does have an unprincipled younger brother—Algernon. Again the couples embrace, Miss Prism and Dr. Chasuble follow suit, and Jack acknowledges that he now understands “the vital Importance of Being Earnest.”"
Relearned,"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern wander through a featureless wilderness, flipping coins, which keep coming up heads. Each time a coin lands on heads, Rosencrantz wins it. While Guildenstern worries about the improbability of a coin landing on heads so many times in a row, Rosencrantz happily continues flipping. Guildenstern wonders if they have entered a world where the laws of chance and time are absent. The pair struggles to recall why they are traveling and remember only that a messenger called them.
They encounter a troupe of actors, known as the Tragedians. The leader of the group, called the Player, indicates that the Tragedians specialize in sexual performances and gives Rosencrantz and Guildenstern the chance to participate for a fee. Guildenstern turns the improbable coin-flipping episode to their advantage by offering the Player a bet. The Player loses but claims he cannot pay. Guildenstern asks for a play instead. Guildenstern starts to leave as the Tragedians prepare, and Rosencrantz reveals that the most recently flipped coin landed tails-up.
The scene changes suddenly. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are now inside Elsinore, the royal castle of Denmark, watching as Hamlet and Ophelia burst onstage and leave in opposite directions. Mistaking Rosencrantz for Guildenstern, Claudius explains that he sent for the pair so that they could ascertain what is bothering Hamlet, their childhood friend.
Bewildered, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern discuss how they might probe Hamlet for the cause of his supposed madness. They play a game of question-and-answer, further confusing themselves about their purpose and even their identities. Guildenstern suggests that he pretend to be Hamlet while Rosencrantz questions him. They realize that Hamlet’s disturbed state is due to the fact that his father, the former king of Denmark, has recently died, and the throne has been usurped by Hamlet’s uncle, Claudius, who also has married Hamlet’s mother, Gertrude. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern overhear Hamlet speaking riddles to Polonius.
Hamlet confuses Rosencrantz and Guildenstern with an enigmatic speech. Polonius comes in to tell Hamlet that the Tragedians have arrived. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern despair about how little they learned of Hamlet’s feelings. They cannot decide whether he is insane.
Polonius, Hamlet, and the Tragedians enter, and Hamlet announces that there will be a play the next day. Hamlet leaves, and Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and the Player discuss the possible causes of Hamlet’s strange behavior. The Player departs while Rosencrantz and Guildenstern discuss what happens after death.
As Claudius, Gertrude, Polonius, and Ophelia enter, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern explain that Hamlet wants them all to attend the play. The group leaves, but Hamlet enters. Not noticing Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, Hamlet wonders whether he should commit suicide. Ophelia enters, praying. After a short conversation, she and Hamlet exit.
Alfred, one of the Tragedians, arrives dressed as Gertrude. The other Tragedians enter to rehearse their play, which parallels Claudius’s rise to power and marriage to Gertrude. Ophelia enters, crying, followed by an angry Hamlet, who tells her to become a nun, then quickly departs. Claudius and Polonius enter and leave with Ophelia. The Player explains the tragic aspects of the Tragedians’ play, which metaphorically retells the recent events at Elsinore and foreshadows the deaths of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. They discuss whether death can be adequately represented on stage. The scene goes black.
In darkness, voices indicate that the play has disturbed Claudius. The next day, Claudius and Gertrude ask Rosencrantz and Guildenstern to find Hamlet, who has killed Polonius. Alone again, the pair concocts a plan to trap Hamlet with their belts, but they fail as Hamlet enters from an unexpected direction and immediately leaves, carrying the dead Polonius. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern call Hamlet back, but he refuses to say what he has done with Polonius’s body. Hamlet accuses Rosencrantz and Guildenstern of being Claudius’s tools. Hamlet escapes as Claudius enters, only to be brought back onstage under guard. The scene shifts outdoors, where Guildenstern tells Rosencrantz that they have to escort Hamlet to England. Hamlet arrives in conversation with a soldier. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern reluctantly depart.
On the boat to England, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern wonder where they are and whether they might be dead. They notice Hamlet sleeping nearby, remember their mission, and consider what to do when they arrive. Guildenstern has a letter from Claudius, which reveals that Hamlet is to be executed in England. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern cannot decide what to do.
As the pair sleeps, Hamlet switches the letter they were carrying with one he has written. The next morning, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern awake and hear music coming from barrels onboard the ship. To their surprise, the Tragedians emerge from the barrels just before pirates charge the ship. Hamlet, the Player, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern jump into the barrels, and the lights go down.
When the lights come back up, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and the Player come out of the barrels. Hamlet is gone. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern tell the Player about the letter and rehearse what they will say to the English king. Guildenstern discovers that the letter now states that Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are to be executed. The Tragedians encircle the pair. Despairing about his fate, Guildenstern takes a knife from the Player and stabs him. The Player cries out and falls, apparently dead. The Tragedians clap as the Player jumps up. He says that his death was a mediocre performance while showing Guildenstern that the knife was actually a stage prop.
The Player describes the different deaths that his troupe can perform while the Tragedians act out those deaths onstage. Rosencrantz applauds, and the light shifts, leaving Rosencrantz and Guildenstern alone. Rosencrantz breaks down and leaves as he realizes his death is near. Guildenstern wonders how they were caught in this situation, lamenting that they failed to seize an opportunity to avert their fate. Guildenstern exits.
The light changes, revealing the dead bodies of Claudius, Gertrude, Hamlet, and Laertes. Horatio arrives and delivers the final speech of Shakespeare’s Hamlet, as the music rises and lights fall."
Personal,"Anne’s diary begins on her thirteenth birthday, June 12, 1942, and ends shortly after her fifteenth. At the start of her diary, Anne describes fairly typical girlhood experiences, writing about her friendships with other girls, her crushes on boys, and her academic performance at school. Because anti-Semitic laws forced Jews into separate schools, Anne and her older sister, Margot, attended the Jewish Lyceum in Amsterdam.
	The Franks had moved to the Netherlands in the years leading up to World War II to escape persecution in Germany. After the Germans invaded the Netherlands in 1940, the Franks were forced into hiding. With another family, the van Daans, and an acquaintance, Mr. Dussel, they moved into a small secret annex above Otto Frank’s office where they had stockpiled food and supplies. The employees from Otto’s firm helped hide the Franks and kept them supplied with food, medicine, and information about the outside world.
	The residents of the annex pay close attention to every development of the war by listening to the radio. Some bits of news catch Anne’s attention and make their way into her diary, providing a vivid historical context for her personal thoughts. The adults make optimistic bets about when the war will end, and their mood is severely affected by Allied setbacks or German advances. Amsterdam is devastated by the war during the two years the Franks are in hiding. All of the city’s residents suffer, since food becomes scarce and robberies more frequent.
	Anne often writes about her feelings of isolation and loneliness. She has a tumultuous relationship with the adults in the annex, particularly her mother, whom she considers lacking in love and affection. She adores her father, but she is frequently scolded and criticized by Mr. and Mrs. van Daan and Mr. Dussel. Anne thinks that her sister, Margot, is smart, pretty, and agreeable, but she does not feel close to her and does not write much about her. Anne eventually develops a close friendship with Peter van Daan, the teenage boy in the annex. Mr. Frank does not approve, however, and the intensity of Anne’s infatuation begins to lessen.
	Anne matures considerably throughout the course of her diary entries, moving from detailed accounts of basic activities to deeper, more profound thoughts about humanity and her own personal nature. She finds it difficult to understand why the Jews are being singled out and persecuted. Anne also confronts her own identity. Though she considers herself to be German, her German citizenship has been revoked, and though she calls Holland her home, many of the Dutch have turned against the Jews. Anne feels a tremendous solidarity with her aggrieved people, and yet at the same time she wants to be seen as an individual rather than a member of a persecuted group.
During the two years recorded in her diary, Anne deals with confinement and deprivation, as well as the complicated and difficult issues of growing up in the brutal circumstances of the Holocaust. Her diary describes a struggle to define herself within this climate of oppression. Anne’s diary ends without comment on August 1, 1944, the end of a seemingly normal day that leaves us with the expectation of seeing another entry on the next page. However, the Frank family is betrayed to the Nazis and arrested on August 4, 1944. Anne’s diary, the observations of an imaginative, friendly, sometimes petty, and rather normal teenage girl, comes to an abrupt and silent end. 
Otto Frank is the family’s sole survivor, and he recovers Anne’s diary from Miep. He decides to fulfill Anne’s wishes by publishing the diary. Anne’s diary becomes a condemnation of the unimaginable horror of the Holocaust, and one of the few accounts that describe it from a young person’s perspective.
	Since Anne’s diary is a true personal account of a life in hiding, it is inappropriate to analyze it as a novel or other work of fiction. Parts of the diary were intended for public view, but others clearly were not. To appreciate and interpret the diary, it is necessary to consider its horrible context, World War II and the Holocaust, before any discussion of plot development or thematic content."
Suns,"A Thousand Splendid Suns is divided into four parts. Part 1 tells the story of Mariam, a young girl born in Afghanistan in the 1950s. Part 2 describes the early life of Laila, who was born in Kabul in the late 1970’s. The lives of the two women intersect in Part 3. Part 4 is from Laila’s perspective. Throughout the story, global and regional power struggles bring chaos and destruction to both women’s lives, and to the country of Afghanistan.
Mariam spends the first fifteen years of her life living with her mother, Nana, in a small kolba (shack) built for them by Mariam’s father, Jalil. Nana and Jalil were not married when Nana became pregnant with Mariam, and Nana often reminds Mariam that she is a harami, an illegitimate child. Jalil visits Mariam weekly, and Mariam longs to be accepted by her father as his other children are. Mariam has one dear friend, Mullah Faizullah, the town tutor. He teaches Mariam from the Koran and cares for Mariam like family. On Mariam’s fifteenth birthday, Jalil does not fulfill his promise to take her to the cinema. It is Mariam’s one wish to be seen around town with her father. When Jalil does not arrive, Mariam leaves her home to find him. Mariam is turned away from her father’s home. When she is taken back to her kolba, Mariam discovers that Nana has hung herself. 
Mariam feels responsible for Nana’s death. When Mariam asked Jalil to take her to see “Pinocchio,” Nana begged Mariam not to leave her alone. Mullah Faizullah tries to comfort Mariam, by visiting her as much as he can. Jalil’s wives soon tell Mariam that she is to be married. Mariam begs her father not to send her away, but Jalil’s decision has already been made. Mariam is married to Rasheed, a shoemaker nearly thirty years older than Mariam. When Jalil sends Mariam to Kabul to live with her new husband, Mariam tells Jalil she never wishes to see him again.
Rasheed’s Islamic beliefs are fundamentalist, and he expects Mariam to keep house, respect her husband, and cover herself when she leaves their home. Kabul is a confusing place for Mariam. While Mariam wears a burqa in public, she sees other women wearing makeup and high heels. Within a few years, Mariam becomes pregnant, and Rasheed prays for a boy. Fariba, a woman from Rasheed’s neighborhood, discovers Mariam bleeding. Rasheed takes Mariam to the hospital, and a doctor confirms that Mariam has had a miscarriage. Soon, Rasheed’s critical attitude toward his wife turns abusive.
In 1978, the political environment in Afghanistan is chaotic. The communist party gains power and eventually overthrows the Afghan government and executes its president. Fariba’s daughter, Laila, is born during this revolution.
Laila has never known her brothers, Ahmad and Noor. The two young men are members of the Afghan resistance fighting against the communist rule of Soviet Russia. Laila’s Mammy is often unwell, in bed, and finds fault with her husband. Hakim, whom Laila calls Babi, is a teacher at the university in Kabul. Babi is tender with Laila and patient with Mammy. When Laila’s family is informed of her brother’s deaths, Mammy is despondent. Laila feels guilty for not grieving as deeply as Mammy. Laila cares more for her dearest friend, Tariq, than she does for her brothers.
Tariq, just a few years older than Laila, is kind to her and a fierce protector. Even though Tariq has lost a leg, he fights neighborhood boys when they bully Laila. As they grow older, Laila becomes more aware of the gossip that surrounds her friendship with Tariq. Though Laila worries about her reputation, she allows her relationship with Tariq to become intimate. By 1992, Laila is fourteen. Communist forces in Afghanistan have been overthrown, and the city of Kabul becomes a battleground for rival warlords. When Tariq tells Laila that his family is leaving Afghanistan, Laila is overcome. The young couple sleep together, even though they have been taught that this is a sin against Allah. Laila refuses to go with Tariq; she will not leave her parents behind. 
Babi finally convinces Mammy to leave Kabul, even though it is Mammy’s dearest wish to see her sons’ cause prevail. As Laila is packing, a rocket hits their home, leaving Mammy and Babi dead and Laila gravely injured.
Rasheed pulls Laila from the rubble, and Mariam nurses Laila back to health. Laila receives a visit from a man named Abdul Sharif. The stranger tells Laila that he spent time in a hospital with Tariq before Tariq died. Laila is heartbroken, and believes Allah is punishing her for not grieving her brothers properly. Rasheed proposes to Laila, and Laila accepts because she is pregnant with Tariq’s child. Laila knows that she has no other choice. Rasheed and Laila are married. Soon, Laila tells Rasheed that she is having his child, and Rasheed once more prays for a son. Again, he is disappointed. Mariam sees how cruel Rasheed is to Laila and her infant daughter, Aziza. Mariam’s once hostile attitude toward Laila grows into fondness. Aziza and Mariam develop a special relationship. 
Rasheed’s cruelty toward the women in his family is tolerated under the new Shari’a law, enforced by the new Taliban regime. Rasheed is now sure that Tariq is Aziza’s real father, and Rasheed uses this secret to keep Laila in line. Mariam and Laila attempt to take the children and leave Rasheed, but the women and children are caught. Under the Taliban, it is illegal for women to run away from the husbands. Rasheed beats Laila and Mariam for trying to leave, and he threatens them with worse if they try again.
Laila does eventually give Rasheed a son, Zalmai. Rasheed spoils his son, and he continues mistreating his wives and Aziza. Rasheed is foolish with his money. When he loses his job, Rasheed forces Laila to put Aziza in an orphanage. Though it is illegal for women to leave their homes without a male family member, Laila visits Aziza as often as she can. She must avoid the Taliban forces, who beat her when they catch her alone. One day, Laila receives a visitor of her own. Tariq is not dead. He has come to take Mariam with him back to Pakistan. Mariam realizes that Rasheed paid a friend to make up the story about Tariq’s death, in order to convince Laila to marry Rasheed.
Zalmai tells his father that Laila had a male visitor. Rasheed is furious, and Mariam sees that he will kill Laila. Mariam beats Rasheed with a shovel until he is dead. Mariam knows she will not live after committing this crime, and she sends Laila and the children away with Tariq. Mariam confesses to murdering her husband, and she is sentenced to death. 
Laila and Tariq take the children to Pakistan, and the two are married. Aziza bonds quickly with her real father, knowing that Tariq will never hurt or leave her. Zalmai asks for Rasheed at first, but he soon learns to love Tariq too. Laila and Tariq watch from afar as the Taliban are driven out by allied forces, following the attack on the United States on September 11th, 2001. Laila convinces Tariq to return to Kabul. On their way home, Laila visits Mariam’s hometown to say goodbye to the woman who saved her life. While there, she meets the son of Mullah Faizullah. Laila learns that the tutor is dead, and so is Mariam’s father Jalil. Jalil had written Mariam a letter, asking for her forgiveness, and he had intended to give Mariam the money from his sold land. 
Laila and Tariq use the money to renovate the orphanage, where Laila is now a teacher. Laila is pregnant with a third child. Kabul has been restored, and Laila wishes her parents were alive to see it."
Race,"Oluo uses the introduction to establish herself as a Black woman who is both proud of her culture and constantly hindered by America’s racism and the social injustice that permeates its society. She is ready to demand change, as are many Black people in an internet age that allows the documentation and validation of their experiences. White people might find these conversations uncomfortable or even scary, but it is far past time for America to address white supremacy and its fundamental, systemic inequities. 
Social change cannot be made in America without considering race, because racial disparities permeate every aspect of society. American society, and especially the American economy, rest on the premise that people of color are born inferior to white people. Even Obama’s election only reaffirmed white America’s denial of racism while spurring white people on to demand more in comparison with their Black and brown counterparts. Racism is systemic, affecting every part of American life. Individual exceptions do not invalidate the overall, cumulative experience of social inequality and oppression. White people do not experience racism, so they need to listen to people of color and trust the validity of their experiences. 
Racism is not limited to the fear or hatred that a white person might feel toward a Black person. It’s the system of inequality perpetuated by the government, business, and education. Only this definition offers the hope of systemic change while demanding that majority individuals face their privilege, their racism, and their role in the fight. Because America is a racist society, white people are guaranteed to make mistakes when talking about it. That fact cannot become an excuse to stop trying, although good intentions are no longer sufficient. White people must apologize and learn to do better when they make hurtful comments. A good start is for everyone to understand the extent of their privilege. The exercise is not intended to inflict guilt but to force everyone to realize the ways in which their lived experiences are different than those of others. That understanding can help everyone demand change in the places where they exercise power.  
People’s identities are compilations of many factors. Intersectionality is a viewpoint that acknowledges all of these factors so people can be respected and valued for all of their identities, whether Black, mixed, male, female, feminist, scholar, artist, and so on. It’s a tough task because it slows social progress and demands empathy, but without it, any social progress only establishes a new hierarchy that then serves to oppress another group of people.  
The book’s central chapters address a variety of racial topics. Police in America treat Black people differently because of racism’s systemic nature. White people have trouble acknowledging this fact because doing so requires they admit the ways racism benefits them. Affirmative action is an admittedly flawed program that nevertheless benefits minorities and should be continued but also advanced. Teachers and school administrators see Black children as larger, older, more aggressive, and less intelligent than their white counterparts, so Black children are disciplined more often and more harshly, leading to their criminalization and institutionalization. The word “n*****” is intrinsically harmful, and even free speech does not justify its use. Also painful is the adoption of a culture’s customs (i.e., cultural appropriation), while benefiting financially from them, not acknowledging their historical development, and not having to share in the struggles that formed them. Touching a Black person’s hair continues America’s racist history of treating Black people’s bodies as white people’s property. It denies a Black person’s autonomy, agency, and right to personal space.  
In the final five chapters, Oluo addresses the painful effects of cumulative acts of systemic racism, beginning with microaggressions. These thoughtless or cruel comments and behaviors accumulate, resulting in psychological damage. Black people have the right to call out these comments and behaviors and to demand an apology. Oluo then discusses that despite the best efforts of previous generations, young Black people have inherited a deeply unjust America, and adults must trust them to carry the battle forward. Racism’s systemic nature is maintained in part by the argument that some Black people, such as Martin Luther King, Jr., are “good” activists who deserve social equality while others, such as Malcolm X, are not. The dichotomy is false; either every person is equal, or America is doomed to forever be a white supremacy. Finally, Oluo encourages her readers to move beyond talking about racism and to take actions to make society truly equal for all."
Earth,"Wang Lung is a poor young farmer in rural, turn-of-the-century China. During the time in which the novel takes place, Chinese society is showing signs of modernization while remaining deeply connected to ancient traditions and customs. When Wang Lung reaches a marriageable age, his father approaches the powerful local Hwang family to ask if they have a spare slave who could marry his son. The Hwangs agree to sell Wang a 20-year-old slave named O-lan, who becomes his wife. O-lan and Wang Lung are pleased with each other, although they exchange few words and although Wang is initially disappointed that O-lan does not have bound feet.
Together, Wang Lung and O-lan cultivate a bountiful and profitable harvest from their land. O-lan becomes pregnant, and Wang Lung is overjoyed when O-lan’s first child is a son. Meanwhile, the powerful Hwang family lives decadently—the husband is obsessed with women, and the wife is an opium addict. Because of their costly habits, the Hwangs fall on hard times, and Wang Lung is able to purchase a piece of their fertile rice land. He enjoys another profitable harvest, and O-lan gives birth to another son. Wang Lung’s new wealth catches the attention of his greedy, lazy uncle. Custom dictates that Wang Lung must show the utmost respect to members of the older generation, especially relatives, so he is forced to loan his uncle money despite knowing that the money will be wasted on drinking and gambling. The Hwang family’s finances continue to falter, and the Hwangs sell another tract of land to Wang Lung.
After O-lan gives birth to a daughter, a terrible famine settles on the land. In the midst of this crisis, O-lan gives birth to another daughter. She strangles the second girl because there is not enough food to feed the baby and the rest of the family. Wang Lung is forced to take his family to a southern city for the winter. There, O-lan and the children beg while Wang Lung earns money by transporting people in a rented rickshaw. They earn just enough money to eat. Wang Lung begins to despair of ever making enough money to return to his land. He and O-lan briefly consider selling their surviving daughter as a slave. Eventually, a group of poor and desperate people ransacks a rich man’s home, and Wang Lung and O-lan join them. Wang Lung steals a pile of gold coins. With this new wealth, he moves the family back home and purchases a new ox and some seeds. O-lan had stolen some jewels during the looting. Wang Lung allows her to keep two small pearls, but he takes the rest and hurries to buy three hundred acres of Old Master Hwang’s land. O-lan gives birth to twins shortly thereafter. The couple realizes that their oldest daughter has severe intellectual disabilities, but Wang Lung loves the child dearly.
Wang Lung hires laborers to plant and harvest his land. He enjoys several years of profitable harvests and becomes a rich man. When a flood forces him to be idle, he begins to feel restless and bored. He finds fault with O-lan’s appearance and cruelly criticizes her for having big feet. He becomes obsessed with Lotus, a beautiful, delicate prostitute with bound feet. Eventually, he purchases Lotus to be his concubine. When O-lan becomes terminally ill, Wang Lung regrets his cruel words and comes to appreciate everything his wife has done for him. Meanwhile, to lessen the demands of his uncle and his uncle’s wife, who have moved their family into his house and continued to exploit his wealth, he tricks them into becoming opium addicts. Eventually, Wang Lung rents the Hwangs’ house and moves into it with his family, leaving his own house to his uncle’s family.
After O-lan’s death, Wang Lung’s sons begin to rebel against his plans for their life. They do not want to work as farmers and do not have his devotion to the land. Furthermore, his first and second sons often argue over money, and their wives develop an intense animosity toward one another. In his old age, Wang Lung takes a young slave, Pear Blossom, as a concubine. She promises to care for his disabled daughter after his death. In time, Wang Lung is surrounded by grandchildren, but he is also surrounded by petty family disagreements. By the end of the novel, despite Wang’s passionate dissent, his sons plan to sell the family land and divide the money among themselves, signaling their final break with the land that made them wealthy."
Ravaged,"Euripedes' Medea opens in a state of conflict. Jason has abandoned his wife, Medea, along with their two children. He hopes to advance his station by remarrying with Glauce, the daughter of Creon, king of Corinth, the Greek city where the play is set. All the events of play proceed out of this initial dilemma, and the involved parties become its central characters.
Outside the royal palace, a nurse laments the events that have lead to the present crisis. After a long series of trials and adventures, which ultimately forced Jason and Medea to seek exile in Corinth, the pair had settled down and established their family, achieving a degree of fame and respectability. Jason's recent abandonment of that family has crushed Medea emotionally, to the degree that she curses her own existence, as well as that of her two children.
Fearing a possible plot of revenge, Creon banishes Medea and her children from the city. After pleading for mercy, Medea is granted one day before she must leave, during which she plans to complete her quest for ""justice""--at this stage in her thinking, the murder of Creon, Glauce, and Jason. Jason accuses Medea of overreacting. By voicing her grievances so publicly, she has endangered her life and that of their children. He claims that his decision to remarry was in everyone's best interest. Medea finds him spineless, and she refuses to accept his token offers of help.
Appearing by chance in Corinth, Aegeus, King of Athens, offers Medea sanctuary in his home city in exchange for her knowledge of certain drugs that can cure his sterility. Now guaranteed an eventual haven in Athens, Medea has cleared all obstacles to completing her revenge, a plan which grows to include the murder of her own children; the pain their loss will cause her does not outweigh the satisfaction she will feel in making Jason suffer.
For the balance of the play, Medea engages in a ruse; she pretends to sympathize with Jason (bringing him into her confidence) and offers his wife ""gifts,"" a coronet and dress. Ostensibly, the gifts are meant to convince Glauce to ask her father to allow the children to stay in Corinth. The coronet and dress are actually poisoned, however, and their delivery causes Glauce's death. Seeing his daughter ravaged by the poison, Creon chooses to die by her side by dramatically embracing her and absorbing the poison himself.
A messenger recounts the gruesome details of these deaths, which Medea absorbs with cool attentiveness. Her earlier state of anxiety, which intensified as she struggled with the decision to commit infanticide, has now given way to an assured determination to fulfill her plans. Against the protests of the chorus, Medea murders her children and flees the scene in a dragon-pulled chariot provided by her grandfather, the Sun-God. Jason is left cursing his lot; his hope of advancing his station by abandoning Medea and marrying Glauce, the conflict which opened the play, has been annihilated, and everything he values has been lost through the deaths that conclude the tragedy."
Encyclopedia,"In the prologue, we meet a man named Elwood Curtis who is living in New York City. As a teenager, he attended the Nickel Academy, a reform school in Florida that is now being demolished. He reads in the newspaper that a secret graveyard has been discovered on the grounds and realizes that he needs to return to the school and tell his story.
Part One of the book takes place in 1962 in Tallahassee, Florida, where a teenage Elwood Curtis receives a record album of speeches by Martin Luther King, Jr. The speeches introduce him to the Civil Rights Movement and have a profound impact on his thinking. Since his parents left town, Elwood has been raised by his strict grandmother, Harriet. After school, Elwood goes to the Richmond Hotel where Harriet works, and he waits in the kitchen, interacting with the staff. One day the kitchen staff trick Elwood into a dish-drying competition and his prize is a set of encyclopedias left behind by a traveling salesman. After hauling the heavy books home, he discovers that all but one of the volumes are blank. Elwood is hurt that the staff took advantage of his trusting nature, and he stops going to the hotel. 
Elwood gets a job as a stock boy at Marconi’s Tobacco & Cigars, a neighborhood grocery. He reads magazines there and becomes more immersed in the Civil Rights Movement. He is smart and capable, but his grandmother and Mr. Marconi worry that his high ideals will get him in trouble. When he exposes some boys who are shoplifting candy, Mr. Marconi disapproves and the boys beat up Elwood after work. A teacher, Mr. Hill, arrives at Elwood’s high school and encourages Elwood’s enthusiasm for civil rights. He gives Elwood books to read, meets him at a local demonstration, and ultimately arranges for Elwood to take a class at a nearby community college. Elwood hitchhikes to see the school, and it turns out that the man who is giving him a ride is driving a stolen car. They’re pulled over by the police and Elwood gets arrested. 
At the beginning of Part Two, a judge sentences Elwood to a reform school called Nickel Academy. He’s taken there in handcuffs with two white boys. Once they arrive, Elwood is hopeful because the Academy looks like a school, not a prison. He is assigned to Cleveland dormitory on the Black students’ campus. The next morning, Desmond, a boy from his dormitory, shows him around. Elwood learns that Nickel is not providing an education, and he is assigned to work on the yard crew with Jaimie, a Hispanic boy who is moved back and forth from the Black campus to the white campus. Desmond and others tell Elwood how to get along at Nickel so he can get released early. Elwood vows to keep quiet and get out early. However, when he sees a boy, Corey, being bullied in the bathroom, he steps in to intervene. All four boys, including Corey and Elwood, are taken from their beds in the middle of the night by the superintendent, Maynard Spencer, and a white houseman named Earl, and subjected to a brutal beating in a building called the White House.
Elwood wakes up from the beating in the school infirmary, where he stays for two weeks until his legs and back have healed. Turner, Elwood’s best friend, eats soap powder to make himself sick so he can visit Elwood. Turner counsels Elwood to try to avoid conflict. Elwood, however, believes that if people are confronted by injustice, they will do the right thing. However, when he sees the scars on his legs from the beating, Elwood is ashamed that he let himself be beaten so badly and doesn’t tell his grandmother about the incident when she visits. 
When Elwood returns to Nickel campus life, Turner gets him a new job called “Community Service.”  Elwood and Turner leave campus in a van with a white 20-year-old named Harper. They bring goods that meant to be used for the Black boys at Nickel and distribute them to local businessmen. The businessmen give envelopes of money to Harper for the medicine, food, and other supplies. Harper then gives the money to Superintendent Spencer and his boss, Director Hardee. After this, Harper leaves Turner and Elwood at the home of one of the board members to paint his gazebo. At night, Elwood writes down everything they do in a notebook.
Every year at Nickel there is a student boxing match between the best Black boxer and the best white boxer. This year the Black boxer is a large, violent bully nicknamed Griff. Superintendent Spencer tells Griff that he needs to lose the fight on purpose, pretending to be knocked out in the third, final round. But the night of the fight, Griff wins. He tells Spencer that he lost track of the rounds and thought there was one more. That night, Spencer and Earl take Griff “out back,” chain him between two trees, and beat him to death. The boys on campus convince themselves that Griff escaped, but his body is found in the secret cemetery decades later.
The students work on an elaborate Christmas Festival containing lights and large displays that attract paying tourists. The festival includes a staff luncheon, and Jaimie puts poison in housemaster Earl’s drink, hoping to kill him. But Earl lives and no one realizes he was poisoned. 
Part Three of the book alternates between adult Elwood’s life in the 1970s and teenage Elwood’s life in Nickel. In the 1970s, Elwood has a girlfriend and is working for a moving company in New York City. He buys his own van and starts a company, Ace Moving, which he later realizes he named after the highest level of achievement at Nickel. 
Back in the 1960s, Elwood realizes that Nickel is breaking him down. The merit and punishment system at Nickel is arbitrary and he feels unable to earn early release. He is losing hope and losing his belief in the teachings of Martin Luther King, Jr. When his grandmother tells him that the lawyer she hired to help him left town with their money, Elwood decides he wants to expose Nickel’s injustices and get the school closed down. 
In the 1980s, Elwood, now the owner of a successful moving company, is recognized on the street by Chickie Pete, who was a fellow student at Nickel. They go to a bar for a drink, and Elwood reflects on how damaged all the boys from Nickel are. Chickie Pete has just gotten out of rehab and has no job or place to live. Elwood is a successful businessman, but he struggles with relationships and is still unmarried. Chickie Pete asks Elwood for a job, but Elwood throws Chickie Pete’s contact information out the window on his cab ride home.
In the 1960s, Spencer is told about an upcoming “surprise” inspection by the state, and all the boys get busy fixing up Nickel and hiding its secrets. Elwood decides to give his notebook, which details the corruption at Nickel, to one of the inspectors. Turner tells him that this is a bad idea and begs him not to do it. Elwood again states his philosophy that people are ultimately good and want to do what is right. On the day of the inspection, Elwood is sent on an errand and is unable to give his notebook to the inspectors, so Turner volunteers to do it for him. When they meet up again, Turner tells Elwood that he handed the notebook to an inspector who looked like John F. Kennedy through the car window as he was leaving. A few nights later, Spencer and his new assistant, Hennepin, come for Elwood at night and he is beaten at the White House. 
In the 2000s, Elwood meets his wife Millie at a fancy restaurant in Harlem. He reflects on a time when the neighborhood was more run-down. 
When the narrative returns to the past, Elwood is locked in a dark room on the top floor of the dormitory, a form of solitary confinement that has been outlawed by the state. He’s there for weeks, subsisting on hardly any food and subjected to extra beatings by Spencer and Hennepin. One night, Turner comes and gets Elwood, telling him that the boys overheard that the following night Spencer is going to take him “out back” and kill him like they killed Griff. Turner and Elwood run away, taking bikes from a house they had cleared out as part of Community Service. They ride all night and through the next day, trying to get to Tallahassee. Turner and Elwood are almost there when a white van pulls up beside them—the Community Service van from Nickel. The boys run across a field as Hennepin and Harper shoot at them with rifles. Hennepin misses, but Harper shoots Elwood, who falls to his death with arms outstretched. Turner keeps running, leaving Elwood behind. 
Back in New York in 2014, Turner, who took Elwood’s identity after he escaped, tells his wife Millie the true story. He tells her about his time in Nickel and reveals his full name: Jack Turner (though no one but his mother has ever called him Jack). They cry together, and Millie commits to helping Turner heal from the trauma of his horrific experience.
The next day, Turner flies to Tallahassee to attend a hearing where the Nickel boys will tell the stories of the atrocities they witnessed and endured. Turner is the only Black alumnus testifying. Turner plans to tell the story of Elwood’s death, and presumably Griff’s story and other accounts. Before the hearing, he has lunch in the restaurant at the hotel where he is staying. The hotel is now called the Radisson, but it used to be the Richmond Hotel. Although Turner doesn’t make the connection, this is the same hotel restaurant where young Elwood sat in the kitchen waiting for his grandmother and dreaming of the day that a Black man would be served in the dining room."
Indignity,"Beloved begins in 1873 in Cincinnati, Ohio, where Sethe, a former slave, has been living with her eighteen-year-old daughter Denver. Sethe’s mother-in-law, Baby Suggs, lived with them until her death eight years earlier. Just before Baby Suggs’s death, Sethe’s two sons, Howard and Buglar, ran away. Sethe believes they fled because of the malevolent presence of an abusive ghost that has haunted their house at 124 Bluestone Road for years. Denver, however, likes the ghost, which everyone believes to be the spirit of her dead sister.
On the day the novel begins, Paul D, whom Sethe has not seen since they worked together on Mr. Garner’s Sweet Home plantation in Kentucky approximately twenty years earlier, stops by Sethe’s house. His presence resurrects memories that have lain buried in Sethe’s mind for almost two decades. From this point on, the story will unfold on two temporal planes. The present in Cincinnati constitutes one plane, while a series of events that took place around twenty years earlier, mostly in Kentucky, constitutes the other. This latter plane is accessed and described through the fragmented flashbacks of the major characters. Accordingly, we frequently read these flashbacks several times, sometimes from varying perspectives, with each successive narration of an event adding a little more information to the previous ones.
From these fragmented memories, the following story begins to emerge: Sethe, the protagonist, was born in the South to an African mother she never knew. When she is thirteen, she is sold to the Garners, who own Sweet Home and practice a comparatively benevolent kind of slavery. There, the other slaves, who are all men, lust after her but never touch her. Their names are Sixo, Paul D, Paul A, Paul F, and Halle. Sethe chooses to marry Halle, apparently in part because he has proven generous enough to buy his mother’s freedom by hiring himself out on the weekends. Together, Sethe and Halle have two sons, Howard and Buglar, as well as a baby daughter whose name we never learn. When she leaves Sweet Home, Sethe is also pregnant with a fourth child. After the eventual death of the proprietor, Mr. Garner, the widowed Mrs. Garner asks her sadistic, vehemently racist brother-in-law to help her run the farm. He is known to the slaves as schoolteacher, and his oppressive presence makes life on the plantation even more unbearable than it had been before. The slaves decide to run.
Schoolteacher and his nephews anticipate the slaves’ escape, however, and capture Paul D and Sixo. Schoolteacher kills Sixo and brings Paul D back to Sweet Home, where Paul D sees Sethe for what he believes will be the last time. She is still intent on running, having already sent her children ahead to her mother-in-law Baby Suggs’s house in Cincinnati. Invigorated by the recent capture, schoolteacher’s nephews seize Sethe in the barn and violate her, stealing the milk her body is storing for her infant daughter. Unbeknownst to Sethe, Halle is watching the event from a loft above her, where he lies frozen with horror. Afterward, Halle goes mad: Paul D sees him sitting by a churn with butter slathered all over his face. Paul D, meanwhile, is forced to suffer the indignity of wearing an iron bit in his mouth.
When schoolteacher finds out that Sethe has reported his and his nephews’ misdeeds to Mrs. Garner, he has her whipped severely, despite the fact that she is pregnant. Swollen and scarred, Sethe nevertheless runs away, but along the way she collapses from exhaustion in a forest. A white girl, Amy Denver, finds her and nurses her back to health. When Amy later helps Sethe deliver her baby in a boat, Sethe names this second daughter Denver after the girl who helped her. Sethe receives further help from Stamp Paid, who rows her across the Ohio River to Baby Suggs’s house. Baby Suggs cleans Sethe up before allowing her to see her three older children.
Sethe spends twenty-eight wonderful days in Cincinnati, where Baby Suggs serves as an unofficial preacher to the black community. On the last day, however, schoolteacher comes for Sethe to take her and her children back to Sweet Home. Rather than surrender her children to a life of dehumanizing slavery, she flees with them to the woodshed and tries to kill them. Only the third child, her older daughter, dies, her throat having been cut with a handsaw by Sethe. Sethe later arranges for the baby’s headstone to be carved with the word “Beloved.” The sheriff takes Sethe and Denver to jail, but a group of white abolitionists, led by the Bodwins, fights for her release. Sethe returns to the house at 124, where Baby Suggs has sunk into a deep depression. The community shuns the house, and the family continues to live in isolation.
Meanwhile, Paul D has endured torturous experiences in a chain gang in Georgia, where he was sent after trying to kill Brandywine, a slave owner to whom he was sold by schoolteacher. His traumatic experiences have caused him to lock away his memories, emotions, and ability to love in the “tin tobacco box” of his heart. One day, a fortuitous rainstorm allows Paul D and the other chain gang members to escape. He travels northward by following the blossoming spring flowers. Years later, he ends up on Sethe’s porch in Cincinnati.
Paul D’s arrival at 124 commences the series of events taking place in the present time frame. Prior to moving in, Paul D chases the house’s resident ghost away, which makes the already lonely Denver resent him from the start. Sethe and Paul D look forward to a promising future together, until one day, on their way home from a carnival, they encounter a strange young woman sleeping near the steps of 124. Most of the characters believe that the woman—who calls herself Beloved—is the embodied spirit of Sethe’s dead daughter, and the novel provides a wealth of evidence supporting this interpretation. Denver develops an obsessive attachment to Beloved, and Beloved’s attachment to Sethe is equally if not more intense. Paul D and Beloved hate each other, and Beloved controls Paul D by moving him around the house like a rag doll and by seducing him against his will.
When Paul D learns the story of Sethe’s “rough choice”—her infanticide—he leaves 124 and begins sleeping in the basement of the local church. In his absence, Sethe and Beloved’s relationship becomes more intense and exclusive. Beloved grows increasingly abusive, manipulative, and parasitic, and Sethe is obsessed with satisfying Beloved’s demands and making her understand why she murdered her. Worried by the way her mother is wasting away, Denver leaves the premises of 124 for the first time in twelve years in order to seek help from Lady Jones, her former teacher. The community provides the family with food and eventually organizes under the leadership of Ella, a woman who had worked on the Underground Railroad and helped with Sethe’s escape, in order to exorcise Beloved from 124. When they arrive at Sethe’s house, they see Sethe on the porch with Beloved, who stands smiling at them, naked and pregnant. Mr. Bodwin, who has come to 124 to take Denver to her new job, arrives at the house. Mistaking him for schoolteacher, Sethe runs at Mr. Bodwin with an ice pick. She is restrained, but in the confusion Beloved disappears, never to return.
Afterward, Paul D comes back to Sethe, who has retreated to Baby Suggs’s bed to die. Mourning Beloved, Sethe laments, “She was my best thing.” But Paul D replies, “You your best thing, Sethe.” The novel then ends with a warning that “[t]his is not a story to pass on.” The town, and even the residents of 124, have forgotten Beloved “[l]ike an unpleasant dream during a troubling sleep.”"
Atrocious,"Jethro Creighton, the protagonist, is young and idealistic when the Civil War begins. At first he thinks the war will be neat, full of marching soldiers and demonstrative patriotism. He learns the realities of war soon enough as he watches his three brothers, his cousin, and his teacher go off to fight. One of his brothers, Bill, chooses to fight for the South in a decision that plagues him for a long time. Jethro and his family follow the progress of the war through the newspapers, but it is hard to tell exactly what is happening. Each day the paper is full of praise or criticism for one of the Union generals, and Jethro has trouble sorting out what is actually going on.
One day Jethro's parents ask him to take the team of horses fifteen miles into town to get supplies. Jethro, excited to prove his responsibility, goes to town, makes his purchases, and then talks to some men at the store. One of the men asks Jethro about Bill and gets angry at the prospect of Bill's betrayal. Jethro stands by Bill, and, later, the editor of the town paper, Ross Milton, takes Jethro to lunch to apologize. Milton and Jethro begin a friendship that lasts throughout the book.
On the way home, Jethro is stopped by Mr. Burdow, the father of the boy who killed Jethro's sister, Mary. Mr. Burdow rides with Jethro for a while, and initially Jethro is scared, but Mr. Burdow explains that he thinks one of the men from the store is waiting for Jethro down the road. They encounter the man, and Mr. Burdow is able to prevent him from hurting Jethro. Jethro makes it home and tells his family about the encounter.
The men from the store begin to haunt the Creightons, eventually burning down their barn and putting oil in their well. The Creightons become sleepless and scared that the men will take further retribution. One day, a boy who is on leave from the war for an injury comes to the Creightons to tell them that their son Tom is dead. While the Creightons mourn, Ross Milton writes a letter in the paper to the men that have been tormenting them, saying that regardless of Bill's decisions the Creightons have sacrificed and lost enough. The attacks stop.
Not long after, Matt, Jethro's father, has a heart attack that renders him unable to work the field. Jenny and Jethro assume that responsibility together. Meanwhile, the war goes back and forth, with reports indicating no clear victors overall. The only concrete information they glean from the paper is the atrocious death toll.
One day while working the fields, Jethro hears a sound in the woods. He investigates and finds his cousin Eb, who has deserted the war. Eb says that he could not continue fighting—the conditions were horrible, and the soldiers did not believe they could win the war. Jethro, unsure about what to do, sneaks food and blankets to Eb but does not tell the rest of the family, who are subject to penalties for housing a deserter. He writes to President Lincoln to ask for advice, and Lincoln responds by telling Jethro that he, too, has been plagued with that problem and has decided to grant amnesty to the deserters who return to their post by a certain time.
Word comes that Shadrach, Jethro's teacher, has been critically injured during a battle, and Jenny and Ross Milton leave for Washington D.C. so that Jenny can see Shadrach for one last time. Eventually, she is able to nurse Shadrach back to health, and Matt gives his consent for the two to marry.
Meanwhile, the Union army plunders the South, as General Sherman leads troops north from Savannah, ransacking and devastating farms and homesteads along the way. He soon joins forces with Grant, and they are able to cut off supplies to the Confederate Army. The Confederate Army surrenders.
Just when it seems that, with the war over, life is going to return to a state of security, President Lincoln is assassinated. His murder leaves Jethro bereft, and nothing is able to soothe him. Shadrach returns and tells Jethro that Jethro is going to move in with him and Jenny so that Jethro can continue his studies."
My,"Jim Burden, a successful New York City lawyer, gives an acquaintance a memoir of his Nebraska childhood in the form of a recollection of their mutual friend, Ántonia Shimerda. This memoir makes up the bulk of the novel.
Jim first arrives in Nebraska at the age of ten, when he makes the trip west to live with his grandparents after finding himself an orphan in Virginia. On the train out west, Jim gets his first glimpse of the Shimerdas, a Bohemian immigrant family traveling in the same direction.
As fate would have it, the Shimerdas have taken up residence in farm neighboring the Burdens’. Jim makes fast friends with the Shimerda children, especially Ántonia, who is nearest to him in age and eager to learn English. Jim tutors Ántonia, and the two of them spend much of the autumn exploring their new landscape together.
In late January, tragedy strikes with the suicide of Mr. Shimerda. After an emotional funeral, the Shimerdas retreat into despair, and the Burdens struggle to be as accommodating as possible. As a result of the hardships that the Shimerdas suffer, Ántonia and Jim find that a wedge has been driven between them.
A couple of years later, the Burdens decide to move into town, and shortly thereafter Ántonia takes a job as a housekeeper with a neighboring family, the Harlings. Jim begins to see more of Ántonia once again, especially when a dancing pavilion comes to town and enlivens the social scene.
Jim’s high school years quickly come to a close, and he is offered a spot at the university in Lincoln. He makes a great success of his high school commencement speech and spends the summer hard at work in preparation for his course of study. Before leaving, he takes one last trip out to the countryside with Ántonia and her friends, where they gather to reminisce about old times together.
In Lincoln, Jim throws himself into his studies, which take up the majority of his time in the first year and a half of his course. In the spring of his second year, he begins to see a good deal of Lena Lingard, a mutual friend of his and Ántonia’s who has always intrigued Jim. After a few months of theatergoing and dalliances about town, Jim decides that he needs to make a fresh start of things and prepares to transfer to Harvard University for his final two years of college.
While Jim is away, Ántonia gets engaged to a local boy and moves to Denver in order to be with him. Days before the wedding, the boy -abandons Ántonia, and she returns to Nebraska heartbroken. She covers up an unexpected pregnancy throughout its term, but in giving birth to a daughter incurs the disapproval of her family. However, she resolves to take care of her baby and continues to work on the farm with her brother.
After graduating from college, during the summer before entering law school, Jim returns to Nebraska to be with his grandparents. Upon hearing of Ántonia’s situation, he decides to drive out to the countryside and visit her. They spend a happy day together reliving old times, and Jim parts with a promise to visit her again very soon.
Twenty years pass before Jim is able to visit Ántonia again. In the intervening period, he establishes himself as a prosperous New York City lawyer, and Ántonia marries and has many children with a man named Cuzak, also of Bohemian origin. Jim’s visit to the Cuzak farm is a happy one, with plenty of laughter and stories. Ántonia and Jim renew their old ties, and Jim resolves to be in closer contact with the Cuzaks in the -coming years.
As he prepares to leave Nebraska and return to New York City, Jim walks along the outskirts of town, near the overgrown road that leads to his childhood home. At peace with himself in this familiar landscape, he feels that his life has come full circle, and he reflects in the moonlight on all that his past with Ántonia has meant to him."
Cautious,"In the shadows within her father’s palace, Circe is mocked and scorned by members of her divine family. She seeks to please others and feel valued but continues to be an afterthought to her parents and a target for her brother and sister’s cruel taunts. When Circe sees Prometheus being whipped and condemned to a terrible fate, she defies her father and brings Prometheus nectar and talks with him. He is the first being to ever suggest to her that she could strive to be different from the other gods. That interaction has a lasting effect on Circe as does the birth of a new brother, Aeëtes, who is also rejected by their mother. As he grows to become Circe’s one and only source of love and friendship, Aeëtes reveals that he has heard secrets the gods talk about. When he tells Circe about pharmaka, magical herbs that grow from blood spilled when the Titans and Olympians battled, the course of Circe’s life changes.  
 
Circe’s loneliness grows when her siblings all leave their father’s palace. Pasiphaë marries King Minos and leaves. Helios gifts Aeëtes with a kingdom far away, and Circe’s brother Perses also leaves. When Circe meets the mortal sailor Glaucos they become friends, and Circe falls in love. Knowing she can never have a life with a mortal, Circe asks her grandmother, Tethys, to change Glaucos into a god. When Tethys says it’s impossible, Circe asks if it could be done through pharmaka. Tethys is horrified at the idea, but Circe learns where divine blood was spilled, goes there, finds magical flowers, and lets sap drip into Glaucos’s mouth as he naps. When he transforms into an arrogant, blue-skinned sea god, Circe believes her dreams of love will finally be realized, and Glaucos is welcomed as a member of the divine family. Instead of marrying Circe, however, Glaucos chooses a nymph named Scylla. Circe is devastated, especially since she thinks of Scylla as vain and cruel. In her desire to divert Glaucos’s plans, Circe pours the magical sap into a cove where Scylla bathes with the idea that it will make Scylla as ugly on the outside as Circe believes she is on the inside. Instead, Scylla becomes a horrifying, six-headed monster who flees to live in a cave near a whirlpool. Horrified and crushed by guilt, Circe confesses to Helios who says what she claims is impossible. It’s only when Aeëtes visits and tells Helios that he, his sisters, and brother are all pharmakis, witches, capable of incredible acts of magic, that Helios takes Circe seriously for the first time in her life.  
It’s decided in a meeting between Helios and Zeus that Circe will be exiled because she’s the only one who willingly sought out pharmaka. The next day, Helios abandons her on an island where she must remain forever. Her new home, Aiaia, has a beautiful house filled with everything she needs, and Circe devotes herself to learning about and honing her witchcraft. Circe’s happiness and newfound sense of freedom ends, however, when Hermes appears one day and shares gossip, including news of how Scylla has been murdering and eating passing sailors. Circe and Hermes become lovers, though she says she will never bear him a child. 
One day, a ship arrives on Aiaia with Daedalus onboard. Circe remembers seeing him at Pasiphaë’s wedding to Minos, and he’s still under Pasiphaë’s control. Circe’s cruel sister sent Daedalus to bring Circe to her. Although she distrusts Pasiphaë, Circe agrees and uses the opportunity to sail through Scylla’s territory to try to stop the monster she created. The spells fail, and sailors on their ship are eaten. Seeing the horror of Scylla in person consumes Circe with guilt. More horror awaits in Crete where the pregnant and laboring Pasiphaë tells Circe she must help her deliver her baby, a monster called the Minotaur, who is the result of Pasiphaë coupling with a magical bull. After cutting the creature from her sister, Circe and Daedalus put the Minotaur in a cage, and Circe makes a potion to control the monster’s appetite to just one season each year. Daedalus and Circe become lovers, and when she leaves, he gives her a loom and materials to weave on it.  
After returning to Aiaia, Circe is lonelier than ever until another ship arrives with Aeëtes’s daughter Medea and her husband Jason. They ask to be cleansed, and Circe does it. Later, they reveal that Medea killed her own brother in order to slow down her father’s pursuit after they took his golden fleece. After observing the couple, Circe tells her niece privately that she doesn’t think her marriage to Jason will last and asks her to live with her on Aiaia and practice their magic together. Medea scorns the offer, declares her love for and trust in Jason, and says Circe is just lonely. Medea and Jason leave, and Aeëtes arrives soon after, furious that Circe didn’t detain the pair. For the first time, however, Circe stands up to him, and he leaves. 
Without any warning, the young nymph Alke arrives and says she was sent to live with Circe as punishment. More nymphs arrive as word spreads among the gods that sending disobedient daughters to Aiaia is a good idea. When Hermes visits, Circe complains about the presence of all the nymphs, and Hermes says she’s gotten dull. Finally disgusted with him, Circe tells Hermes she’s done with him. Another ship arrives with sailors who say they’re lost, and Circe is excited by the prospect of being helpful and useful. Still, she is wise enough to be cautious and adds a potion to the wine in case they mean harm. Despite her precautions, the captain rapes Circe, covering her mouth so she can’t speak the spell to save herself. After it’s over, she turns all the men into pigs and slaughters them. More ships come, and Circe turns all the sailors into pigs until a man named Odysseus arrives alone and says his crew visited while he waited by the shore. For the first time, Circe finds someone who is a match for her wit and is impressed when Odysseus takes care in how he speaks to her and doesn’t drink the enchanted wine. Intrigued, Circe transforms his crew back, and they stay for a year, during which time Odysseus and Circe become lovers. He tells her about his adventures, including the Trojan War and how the goddess Athena is his patron, but he eventually leaves to return to his wife and son. Unbeknownst to him, Circe is pregnant with Odysseus’s son. 
Circe is sick throughout her pregnancy, and she has a hard time birthing Telegonus. He is a difficult baby who always seems to be in danger of harm. When the goddess Athena visits and demands the baby, Circe summons all her powers to put a spell over the entire island to protect Telegonus from Athena. For sixteen years, the boy grows up healthy and happy on Aiaia until he reveals that he wants to go find his father. Terrified of what could happen to him if he leaves her zone of protection, Circe refuses, and she’s furious when she learns Hermes has secretly helped the boy build a boat. Ultimately, though, Circe realizes she can’t stop him. She goes to the bottom of the sea to challenge Trygon, a massive stingray with a poison tail that is said to be able to wound even the gods. After winning the tail, she makes a spear for Telegonus with Trygon’s tail to take on his journey, and Telegonus sails for Ithaca to meet Odysseus. 
After long days of waiting, Circe welcomes Telegonus home, but he has brought Penelope and Telemachus with him. As his story unfolds about his journey, Telegonus tearfully confides how he accidentally killed Odysseus with the spear. Telemachus did not try to avenge his father’s death, so he and his mother had to flee the angry and vengeful citizens of Ithaca. When Telegonus brings them to his mother, Telemachus tells Circe that his father was paranoid and violent, and Penelope confesses that she’s afraid Athena will kill Telemachus for not seeking revenge. Although still suspicious and on guard, Circe allows them to stay, and they live peacefully together until Hermes comes with a message that Athena demands to come speak with them. Only after Athena promises that no harm will come to any of them, including Telegonus, does Circe agree to drop the spell. 
Athena arrives and offers Telemachus a kingdom in the west. He graciously refuses, so Athena makes the offer to Telegonus. Knowing her son will never be happy living on Aiaia, Circe reluctantly gives her blessing. Telegonus leaves, and Circe realizes she is also desperate to see the world. She summons Helios and demands to be released from exile, threatening him until he relents. Circe leaves Aiaia in Penelope’s care, and Telemachus asks to join Circe on her journey. After a long life of growing in power and wisdom, Circe finally creates a plan and a potion to turn Scylla to stone. Free from the burden that has tormented her for so long, Circe finally feels free. She and Telemachus become lovers before traveling to where she first found the magical flowers that began her witchcraft and then returning to Aiaia. With a vision of a happy mortal life with Telemachus in her mind, Circe drinks the magical sap, hoping that it will make her mortal so she can make her vision come true."
Accords,"Gregor Samsa, a traveling salesman, wakes up in his bed to find himself transformed into a large insect. He looks around his room, which appears normal, and decides to go back to sleep to forget about what has happened. He attempts to roll over, only to discover that he cannot due to his new body—he is stuck on his hard, convex back. He tries to scratch an itch on his stomach, but when he touches himself with one of his many new legs, he is disgusted. He reflects on how dreary life as a traveling salesman is and how he would quit if his parents and sister did not depend so much on his income. He turns to the clock and sees that he has overslept and missed his train to work.
Gregor’s mother knocks on the door, and when he answers her, Gregor finds that his voice has changed. His family suspects that he may be ill, so they ask him to open the door, which he keeps locked out of habit. He tries to get out of bed, but he cannot maneuver his transformed body. While struggling to move, he hears his office manager come into the family’s apartment to find out why Gregor has not shown up to work. He eventually rocks himself to the floor and calls out that he will open the door momentarily.
Through the door, the office manager warns Gregor of the consequences of missing work and hints that Gregor’s recent work has not been satisfactory. Gregor protests and tells the office manager that he will be there shortly. Neither his family nor the office manager can understand what Gregor says, and they suspect that something may be seriously wrong with him. Gregor manages to unlock and open the door with his mouth, since he has no hands. He begs the office manager’s forgiveness for his late start. Horrified by Gregor’s appearance, the office manager bolts from the apartment. Gregor tries to catch up with the fleeing office manager, but his father drives him back into the bedroom with a cane and a rolled newspaper. Gregor injures himself squeezing back through the doorway, and his father slams the door shut. Gregor, exhausted, falls asleep.
Gregor wakes and sees that someone has put milk and bread in his room. Initially excited, he quickly discovers that he has no taste for milk, once one of his favorite foods. He settles himself under a couch and listens to the quiet apartment. The next morning, his sister Grete comes in, sees that he has not touched the milk, and replaces it with rotting food scraps, which Gregor happily eats. This begins a routine in which his sister feeds him and cleans up while he hides under the couch, afraid that his appearance will frighten her. Gregor spends his time listening through the wall to his family members talking. They often discuss the difficult financial situation they find themselves in now that Gregor can’t provide for them. Gregor also learns that his mother wants to visit him, but his sister and father will not let her.
Gregor grows more comfortable with his changed body. He begins climbing the walls and ceiling for amusement. Discovering Gregor’s new pastime, Grete decides to remove some of the furniture to give Gregor more space. She and her mother begin taking furniture away, but Gregor finds their actions deeply distressing. He tries to save a picture on the wall of a woman wearing a fur hat, fur scarf, and a fur muff. Gregor’s mother sees him hanging on the wall and passes out. Grete calls out to Gregor—the first time anyone has spoken directly to him since his transformation. Gregor runs out of the room and into the kitchen. His father returns from his new job, and misunderstanding the situation, believes Gregor has tried to attack the mother. The father throws apples at Gregor, and one sinks into his back and remains lodged there. Gregor manages to get back into his bedroom but is severely injured.
Gregor’s family begins leaving the bedroom door open for a few hours each evening so he can watch them. He sees his family wearing down as a result of his transformation and their new poverty. Even Grete seems to resent Gregor now, feeding him and cleaning up with a minimum of effort. The family replaces their maid with a cheap cleaning lady who tolerates Gregor’s appearance and speaks to him occasionally. They also take on three boarders, requiring them to move excess furniture into Gregor’s room, which distresses Gregor. Gregor has also lost his taste for the food Grete brings and he almost entirely ceases eating.
One evening, the cleaning lady leaves Gregor’s door open while the boarders lounge about the living room. Grete has been asked to play the violin for them, and Gregor creeps out of his bedroom to listen. The boarders, who initially seemed interested in Grete, grow bored with her performance, but Gregor is transfixed by it. One of the boarders spots Gregor and they become alarmed. Gregor’s father tries to shove the boarders back into their rooms, but the three men protest and announce that they will move out immediately without paying rent because of the disgusting conditions in the apartment.
Grete tells her parents that they must get rid of Gregor or they will all be ruined. Her father agrees, wishing Gregor could understand them and would leave of his own accord. Gregor does in fact understand and slowly moves back to the bedroom. There, determined to rid his family of his presence, Gregor dies.
Upon discovering that Gregor is dead, the family feels a great sense of relief. The father kicks out the boarders and decides to fire the cleaning lady, who has disposed of Gregor’s body. The family takes a trolley ride out to the countryside, during which they consider their finances. Months of spare living as a result of Gregor’s condition have left them with substantial savings. They decide to move to a better apartment. Grete appears to have her strength and beauty back, which leads her parents to think about finding her a husband."
Then,"Eight people, all strangers to each other, are invited to Indian Island, off the English coast. Vera Claythorne, a former governess, thinks she has been hired as a secretary; Philip Lombard, an adventurer, and William Blore, an ex-detective, think they have been hired to look out for trouble over the weekend; Dr. Armstrong thinks he has been hired to look after the wife of the island’s owner. Emily Brent, General Macarthur, Tony Marston, and Judge Wargrave think they are going to visit old friends.
	When they arrive on the island, the guests are greeted by Mr. and Mrs. Rogers, the butler and housekeeper, who report that the host, someone they call Mr. Owen, will not arrive until the next day. That evening, as all the guests gather in the drawing room after an excellent dinner, they hear a recorded voice accusing each of them of a specific murder committed in the past and never uncovered. They compare notes and realize that none of them, including the servants, knows “Mr. Owen,” which suggests that they were brought here according to someone’s strange plan.
	As they discuss what to do, Tony Marston chokes on poisoned whiskey and dies. Frightened, the party retreats to bed, where almost everyone is plagued by guilt and memories of their crimes. Vera Claythorne notices the similarity between the death of Marston and the first verse of a nursery rhyme, “Ten Little Indians,” that hangs in each bedroom. 
	The next morning the guests find that Mrs. Rogers apparently died in her sleep. The guests hope to leave that morning, but the boat that regularly delivers supplies to the island does not show up. Blore, Lombard, and Armstrong decide that the deaths must have been murders and determine to scour the island in search of the mysterious Mr. Owen. They find no one, however. Meanwhile, the oldest guest, General Macarthur, feels sure he is going to die and goes to look out at the ocean. Before lunch, Dr. Armstrong finds the general dead of a blow to the head.
	The remaining guests meet to discuss their situation. They decide that one of them must be the killer. Many make vague accusations, but Judge Wargrave reminds them that the existing evidence suggests any of them could be the killer. Afternoon and dinner pass restlessly, and everyone goes to bed, locking his or her door before doing so. The next morning, they find that Rogers has been killed while chopping wood in preparation for breakfast. At this point, the guests feel sure the murders are being carried out according to the dictates of the nursery rhyme. Also, they realize that the dining-room table initially featured ten Indian figures, but with each death one of the figures disappears.
	After breakfast, Emily Brent feels slightly giddy, and she remains alone at the table for a while. She is soon found dead, her neck having been injected with poison. At this point, Wargrave initiates an organized search of everyone’s belongings, and anything that could be used as a weapon is locked away. The remaining guests sit together, passing time and casting suspicious looks at each other. Finally, Vera goes to take a bath, but she is startled by a piece of seaweed hanging from her ceiling and cries out. Blore, Lombard, and Armstrong run to help her, only to return downstairs to find Wargrave draped in a curtain that resembles courtroom robes and bearing a red mark on his forehead. Armstrong examines the body and reports that Wargrave has been shot in the head.
	That night, Blore hears footsteps in the hall; upon checking, he finds that Armstrong is not in his room. Blore and Lombard search for Armstrong, but they cannot find him anywhere in the house or on the island. When they return from searching, they discover another Indian figure missing from the table.
	Vera, Lombard, and Blore go outside, resolving to stay in the safety of the open land. Blore decides to go back into the house to get food. The other two hear a crash, and they find someone has pushed a statue out of a second-story window, killing Blore as he approached the house. Vera and Lombard retreat to the shore, where they find Armstrong’s drowned body on the beach. Convinced that Lombard is the killer, Vera steals Lombard’s gun and shoots him. She returns to her bedroom to rest, happy to have survived. But upon finding a noose waiting for her in her room, she feels a strange compulsion to enact the last line of the nursery rhyme, and hangs herself.
	The mystery baffles the police until a manuscript in a bottle is found. The late Judge Wargrave wrote the manuscript explaining that he planned the murders because he wanted to punish those whose crimes are not punishable under law. Wargrave frankly admits to his own lust for blood and pleasure in seeing the guilty punished. When a doctor told Wargrave he was dying, he decided to die in a blaze, instead of letting his life trickle away. He discusses how he chose his victims and how he did away with Marston, Mr. and Mrs. Rogers, Macarthur, and Emily Brent. Wargrave then describes how he tricked Dr. Armstrong into helping him fake his own death, promising to meet the doctor by the cliffs to discuss a plan. When Armstrong arrived, Wargrave pushed him over the edge into the sea, then returned to the house and pretended to be dead. His ruse enabled him to dispose of the rest of the guests without drawing their suspicion. Once Vera hanged herself on a noose that he prepared for her, Wargrave planned to shoot himself in such a way that his body would fall onto the bed as if it had been laid there. Thus, he hoped, the police would find ten dead bodies on an empty island."
Apply,"A Raisin in the Sun portrays a few weeks in the life of the Youngers, a Black family living on the South Side of Chicago in the 1950s. When the play opens, the Youngers are about to receive an insurance check for $10,000. This money comes from the deceased Mr. Younger’s life insurance policy. Each of the adult members of the family has an idea as to what he or she would like to do with this money. The matriarch of the family, Mama, wants to buy a house to fulfill a dream she shared with her husband. Mama’s son, Walter Lee, would rather use the money to invest in a liquor store with his friends. He believes that the investment will solve the family’s financial problems forever. Walter’s wife, Ruth, agrees with Mama, however, and hopes that she and Walter can provide more space and opportunity for their son, Travis. Finally, Beneatha, Walter’s sister and Mama’s daughter, wants to use the money for her medical school tuition. She also wishes that her family members were not so interested in assimilating into the white world. Beneatha instead tries to find her identity by looking back to the past and to Africa.
As the play progresses, the Youngers clash over their competing dreams. Ruth discovers that she is pregnant but fears that if she has the child, she will put more financial pressure on her family members. When Walter says nothing to Ruth’s admission that she is considering abortion, Mama puts a down payment on a house for the whole family. She believes that a bigger, brighter dwelling will help them all. This house is in Clybourne Park, an entirely white neighborhood. When the Youngers’ future neighbors find out that the Youngers are moving in, they send Mr. Lindner, from the Clybourne Park Improvement Association, to offer the Youngers money in return for staying away. The Youngers refuse the deal, even after Walter loses the rest of the money ($6,500) to his friend Willy Harris, who persuades Walter to invest in the liquor store and then runs off with his cash.
In the meantime, Beneatha rejects her suitor, George Murchison, whom she believes to be shallow and blind to the problems of race. Subsequently, she receives a marriage proposal from her Nigerian boyfriend, Joseph Asagai, who wants Beneatha to get a medical degree and move to Africa with him (Beneatha does not make her choice before the end of the play). The Youngers eventually move out of the apartment, fulfilling the family’s long-held dream. Their future seems uncertain and slightly dangerous, but they are optimistic and determined to live a better life. They believe that they can succeed if they stick together as a family and resolve to defer their dreams no longer."
Stipulations,"Marjane “Marji” Satrapi is an intelligent, spirited, and very modern girl living with her parents in Iran’s capital of Tehran during the eventful period of Iranian history from the late 1970s into the early 1980s. In Persepolis: The Story of a Childhood, Marji’s remembers her life during those years, mostly from when she was about ten to age fourteen. This account includes how Marji and her family lived through and were affected by turbulent events that included the overthrow of the autocratic Shah of Iran by the Islamic revolution, the oppressive fundamentalist regime that replaced the Shah, and the devasting Iran-Iraq war.
The nation’s wealth has long made it a target of outside invaders, but Islamic revolution of 1979 has pushed out the Western-backed government of the Shah.  The revolution has ushered in a new Islamic regime that is bringing massive societal changes impacting how people are supposed to behave--including Marji and her family. Marji struggles to adjust to the changes at her liberal French bilingual school, which has become increasingly stricter. Girls are required to wear veils and female and male students are now separated. Marji’s wealthy and modern parents—her father, Ebi, and her mother, Taji—take part in the massive protests against the new regime’s strict rules on behavior (just as they had previously protested against the Shah’s regime). Marji’s parents worry when a photo of Marji’s mother a protest appears in newspapers magazines. Later, after a demonstration they are at turns violent, the Satrapis decide that openly protesting is too dangerous to continue to do.
Marji feels conflict between her own deeply spiritual feelings and the stark modernism of her parents. She talks to God at night and has believed she will become a prophet one day since she was six years old, Marji. But the revolution leads to Marji setting aside these ambitions while she studies and imitates protestors and revolutionaries. She mimics protestors in the garden of her house and studies books about famous revolutionaries and philosophers given to her by her parents. She fantasizes about becoming a hero and wants her parents to become heroes too. Marji’s relationship with God becomes strained, as she finds that she and God have less to talk about—although God does still come by to see her from time to time.
Marji thrills when she learns that rebels fill her family history. She learns that her grandfather was a prince and later a communist whom the Shah removed from power and that her uncle Anoosh, also a communist, spent nine years in prison during the Shah’s regime. Marji spends a short time with Anoosh, learning about his life. After the Shah fell from power in 1979, Anoosh was released from prison, but when Islamic fundamentalists consolidate their grip on power, they hunt Anoosh down, imprison him, and later execute him. Her new idol killed, Marji feels crushed. She completely abandons her faith in God and increasingly questions the pro-regime propaganda she hears—especially at school.
Marji deeply loves and identifies with of her parents, even if she does sometimes feel that their actions and behavior (as wealthy and privileged individuals) do not always live up to their pro-democratic and liberal rhetoric. Marji also has a special connection with her grandmother, who remains stoic and inspiring to Marji in spite of the turmoil and numerous tragedies stemming from political actions that impact her and the family. Marji’s uncle Anoosh is not Marji’s only direct experience with the cruel consequences of the government’s actions. Throughout the book, death and devastation occurs among Marji’s extended family and friends as direct results of the brutality and fanaticism of the Iranian regimes and the war with Iraq.
People had rejoiced when the Shah was forced out, but as Islamic fundamentalists retain power, Marji and her family watch as their neighbors’ behavior shifts back and forth to coincide with the current political winds. The neighbors go from wearing short skirts and drinking alcohol to covering themselves and denouncing the use of alcohol. Marji’s parents ask her to tell everyone that she prays every day, a lie they hope will keep Marji safe, but acknowledge that the rules seem foolish. Marji grows more rebellious, as she increasingly views the rules at school and elsewhere as hypocritical and difficult to follow. Armed with more knowledge and personal experience, Marji begins to act out in ways that put her safety at risk. In fact, she even (accidentally) hits her principal during an argument, which results in her expulsion from school. Fearing her rebellious behavior will get her killed, Marji’s mother tries to reason with Marji by telling her that it is not her responsibility to serve justice and that the bad guys eventually pay for their sins in the end.
The war with Iraq had originally inspired Marji to vocal patriotism in protection her country against another invasion, but Marji begins to realize there are greater forces behind the war. She sees how the Islamic regime needs the war to continue survive and keep power. The war promotes a sense of nationalism and pride in the public, and those who die in the war are hailed as “martyrs.” Marji sees thousands of poor boys lured into war without proper training. She becomes increasingly uncomfortable and aware of class differences within society. Poor young boys are lured into the army with gold-painted keys to the “kingdom of heaven” to help them enter paradise after dying on the battlefield, while children in her wealthy neighborhood are left alone.
More and more people try to escape Iran as the borders tighten and Iraqi forces bomb Tehran and other Iranian cities. Realizing that Marji’s chances of escaping Iran are narrowing, her parents make the difficult decision to send her abroad alone to finish school in Vienna, explaining that only a good education will free her of Iran. Marji feels heartbroken. She spends one last night with her grandmother, who gives her warm advice and inspires her to be compassionate and understanding while in Vienna. Marji gives away all of her prized contraband to her friends, including a Kim Wilde poster. At the airport, as Marji turns to say goodbye to her parents one last time to see that her mother, devasted by her only child’s departure, has fainted."
While,"NOTE: Although Night is not necessarily a memoir, this SparkNotes guide often refers to it as one, since the work’s mixture of testimony, deposition, and emotional truth-telling renders it similar to works in the memoir genre. It is clear that Eliezer is meant to serve, to a great extent, as author Elie Wiesel’s stand-in and representative. Minor details have been altered, but what happens to Eliezer is what happened to Wiesel himself during the Holocaust. It is important to remember, however, that there is a difference between the persona of narrator of Night, Eliezer, and that of its author, Elie Wiesel.
Night is narrated by Eliezer, a Jewish teenager who, when the memoir begins, lives in his hometown of Sighet, in Hungarian Transylvania. Eliezer studies the Torah (the first five books of the Old Testament) and the Kabbalah (a doctrine of Jewish mysticism). His instruction is cut short, however, when his teacher, Moishe the Beadle, is deported. In a few months, Moishe returns, telling a horrifying tale: the Gestapo (the German secret police force) took charge of his train, led everyone into the woods, and systematically butchered them. Nobody believes Moishe, who is taken for a lunatic.
In the spring of 1944, the Nazis occupy Hungary. Not long afterward, a series of increasingly repressive measures are passed, and the Jews of Eliezer’s town are forced into small ghettos within Sighet. Soon they are herded onto cattle cars, and a nightmarish journey ensues. After days and nights crammed into the car, exhausted and near starvation, the passengers arrive at Birkenau, the gateway to Auschwitz.
Upon his arrival in Birkenau, Eliezer and his father are separated from his mother and sisters, whom they never see again. In the first of many “selections” that Eliezer describes in the memoir, the Jews are evaluated to determine whether they should be killed immediately or put to work. Eliezer and his father seem to pass the evaluation, but before they are brought to the prisoners’ barracks, they stumble upon the open-pit furnaces where the Nazis are burning babies by the truckload.
The Jewish arrivals are stripped, shaved, disinfected, and treated with almost unimaginable cruelty. Eventually, their captors march them from Birkenau to the main camp, Auschwitz. They eventually arrive in Buna, a work camp, where Eliezer is put to work in an electrical-fittings factory. Under slave-labor conditions, severely malnourished and decimated by the frequent “selections,” the Jews take solace in caring for each other, in religion, and in Zionism, a movement favoring the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine, considered the holy land. In the camp, the Jews are subject to beatings and repeated humiliations. A vicious foreman forces Eliezer to give him his gold tooth, which is pried out of his mouth with a rusty spoon.
The prisoners are forced to watch the hanging of fellow prisoners in the camp courtyard. On one occasion, the Gestapo even hang a small child who had been associated with some rebels within Buna. Because of the horrific conditions in the camps and the ever-present danger of death, many of the prisoners themselves begin to slide into cruelty, concerned only with personal survival. Sons begin to abandon and abuse their fathers. Eliezer himself begins to lose his humanity and his faith, both in God and in the people around him.
After months in the camp, Eliezer undergoes an operation for a foot injury. While he is in the infirmary, however, the Nazis decide to evacuate the camp because the Russians are advancing and are on the verge of liberating Buna. In the middle of a snowstorm, the prisoners begin a death march: they are forced to run for more than fifty miles to the Gleiwitz concentration camp. Many die of exposure to the harsh weather and exhaustion. At Gleiwitz, the prisoners are herded into cattle cars once again. They begin another deadly journey: one hundred Jews board the car, but only twelve remain alive when the train reaches the concentration camp Buchenwald. Throughout the ordeal, Eliezer and his father help each other to survive by means of mutual support and concern. In Buchenwald, however, Eliezer’s father dies of dysentery and physical abuse. Eliezer survives, an empty shell of a man until April 11, 1945, the day that the American army liberates the camp."
Giving,"The Giver is written from the point of view of Jonas, an eleven-year-old boy living in a futuristic society that has eliminated all pain, fear, war, and hatred. There is no prejudice, since everyone looks and acts basically the same, and there is very little competition. Everyone is unfailingly polite. The society has also eliminated choice: at age twelve every member of the community is assigned a job based on his or her abilities and interests. Citizens can apply for and be assigned compatible spouses, and each couple is assigned exactly two children each. The children are born to Birthmothers, who never see them, and spend their first year in a Nurturing Center with other babies, or “newchildren,” born that year. When their children are grown, family units dissolve and adults live together with Childless Adults until they are too old to function in the society. Then they spend their last years being cared for in the House of the Old until they are finally “released” from the society. In the community, release is death, but it is never described that way; most people think that after release, flawed newchildren and joyful elderly people are welcomed into the vast expanse of Elsewhere that surrounds the communities. Citizens who break rules or fail to adapt properly to the society’s codes of behavior are also released, though in their cases it is an occasion of great shame. Everything is planned and organized so that life is as convenient and pleasant as possible.
Jonas lives with his father, a Nurturer of new children, his mother, who works at the Department of Justice, and his seven-year-old sister Lily. At the beginning of the novel, he is apprehensive about the upcoming Ceremony of Twelve, when he will be given his official Assignment as a new adult member of the community. He does not have a distinct career preference, although he enjoys volunteering at a variety of different jobs. Though he is a well-behaved citizen and a good student, Jonas is different: he has pale eyes, while most people in his community have dark eyes, and he has unusual powers of perception. Sometimes objects “change” when he looks at them. He does not know it yet, but he alone in his community can perceive flashes of color; for everyone else, the world is as devoid of color as it is of pain, hunger, and inconvenience.
At the Ceremony of Twelve, Jonas is given the highly honored Assignment of Receiver of Memory. The Receiver is the sole keeper of the community’s collective memory. When the community went over to Sameness—its painless, warless, and mostly emotionless state of tranquility and harmony—it abandoned all memories of pain, war, and emotion, but the memories cannot disappear totally. Someone must keep them so that the community can avoid making the mistakes of the past, even though no one but the Receiver can bear the pain. Jonas receives the memories of the past, good and bad, from the current Receiver, a wise old man who tells Jonas to call him the Giver.
The Giver transmits memories by placing his hands on Jonas’s bare back. The first memory he receives is of an exhilarating sled ride. As Jonas receives memories from the Giver—memories of pleasure and pain, of bright colors and extreme cold and warm sun, of excitement and terror and hunger and love—he realizes how bland and empty life in his community really is. The memories make Jonas’s life richer and more meaningful, and he wishes that he could give that richness and meaning to the people he loves. But in exchange for their peaceful existence, the people of Jonas’s community have lost the capacity to love him back or to feel deep passion about anything. Since they have never experienced real suffering, they also cannot appreciate the real joy of life, and the life of individual people seems less precious to them. In addition, no one in Jonas’s community has ever made a choice of his or her own. Jonas grows more and more frustrated with the members of his community, and the Giver, who has felt the same way for many years, encourages him. The two grow very close, like a grandfather and a grandchild might have in the days before Sameness, when family members stayed in contact long after their children were grown.
Meanwhile, Jonas is helping his family take care of a problem newchild, Gabriel, who has trouble sleeping through the night at the Nurturing Center. Jonas helps the child to sleep by transmitting soothing memories to him every night, and he begins to develop a relationship with Gabriel that mirrors the family relationships he has experienced through the memories. When Gabriel is in danger of being released, the Giver reveals to Jonas that release is the same as death. Jonas’s rage and horror at this revelation inspire the Giver to help Jonas devise a plan to change things in the community forever. The Giver tells Jonas about the girl who had been designated the new Receiver ten years before. She had been the Giver’s own daughter, but the sadness of some of the memories had been too much for her and she had asked to be released. When she died, all of the memories she had accumulated were released into the community, and the community members could not handle the sudden influx of emotion and sensation. The Giver and Jonas plan for Jonas to escape the community and to actually enter Elsewhere. Once he has done that, his larger supply of memories will disperse, and the Giver will help the community to come to terms with the new feelings and thoughts, changing the society forever.
However, Jonas is forced to leave earlier than planned when his father tells him that Gabriel will be released the next day. Desperate to save Gabriel, Jonas steals his father’s bicycle and a supply of food and sets off for Elsewhere. Gradually, he enters a landscape full of color, animals, and changing weather, but also hunger, danger, and exhaustion. Avoiding search planes, Jonas and Gabriel travel for a long time until heavy snow makes bike travel impossible. Half-frozen, but comforting Gabriel with memories of sunshine and friendship, Jonas mounts a high hill. There he finds a sled—the sled from his first transmitted memory—waiting for him at the top. Jonas and Gabriel experience a glorious downhill ride on the sled. Ahead of them, they see—or think they see—the twinkling lights of a friendly village at Christmas, and they hear music. Jonas is sure that someone is waiting for them there."
South,"A Raisin in the Sun portrays a few weeks in the life of the Youngers, a Black family living on the South Side of Chicago in the 1950s. When the play opens, the Youngers are about to receive an insurance check for $10,000. This money comes from the deceased Mr. Younger’s life insurance policy.

River,"The novel’s protagonist and narrator, Salim, grew up in a community of ethnically Indian Muslims on the east African coast. As the novel opens, Salim explains how he came to leave his coastal home and move to an unnamed country in the African interior. Worried that the trend of political independence sweeping the continent would scatter his home community, Salim sought a way out. When a family friend named Nazruddin returned to the coast after several years in the interior, he offered to sell Salim his trading goods shop. Salim took Nazruddin up on his offer and drove to his new home: a former colonial town located at the bend in a major river.
Salim found the town decrepit and scattered with vestiges of empire that local Africans had destroyed in retaliation against their longstanding colonial oppressor. Only a few Europeans remained, and most Africans had returned to their villages in the bush. Not long after Salim’s arrival in the interior, an uprising devastated the Indian community on the coast. News of the persecutions vindicated Salim’s decision to relocate. In the midst of the uprising, Salim’s family sent a half-African former slave named Metty to serve as Salim’s shop assistant.
Salim’s modest shop traded in basic household goods, and his first customer was an African trader named Zabeth, locally renowned as a sorceress. Zabeth wanted her son, Ferdinand, to get a formal education, so she sent him to attend the secondary school in the town and asked Salim to watch over him. A Belgian priest named Father Huismans ran the school. Though Huismans believed in European superiority, African religions fascinated him, and he maintained a collection of wooden masks.
Just as life in the town began to pick up, rebel activity ignited in the bush. The President sent white mercenaries, and they swiftly quashed the rebellion. As peace set in again, Huismans was murdered while on an expedition in the bush. Soon after the murder, which nobody investigated, an American traveler stole the majority of Huismans’s mask collection.
Following the rebellion, the town experienced an economic boom, and it once again became a regional trading center. In the midst of the boom, the President commandeered a section of land near the town that had once been a European suburb but had since reverted to bush. On the large plot, now deemed a “Domain of the State,” the President commissioned the construction of modern-looking buildings that would comprise a new polytechnic university. The people in the town, however, remained largely ignorant of what went on in the Domain, which seemed to them a world apart.
Lecturers and professors came from the capital and from abroad, including a childhood friend of Salim’s named Indar. Indar introduced Salim to the society of the Domain, which was full of European intellectuals and African students discussing “the new Africa.” Though stimulated by his experiences in the Domain, Salim felt conflicted about the place. The lofty discussions of African modernity clashed with the evidently shoddy construction of the buildings and an aborted farm project, already overgrown with unused tractors rusting in the field.
Among the people Salim met in the Domain were a historian named Raymond and his much younger wife, Yvette. Raymond was once the President’s mentor, and he remained loyal to the President despite falling out of the politician’s favor. Though Raymond’s progress on a monumental history of the country had stalled, he worked on editing a collection of the President’s speeches. But the President, evidently displeased with Raymond’s work, published and distributed a radically altered version of the book that only included brief maxims.
Meanwhile, Salim engaged in an affair with Yvette. For Salim, who had only previously slept with prostitutes, his intensely physical liaisons with Yvette proved reinvigorating. But as their relationship progressed, Salim grew uncomfortable with his connection to Yvette and the failures of her husband. Sensing that Yvette saw him as another version of Raymond, Salim attacked her. Their affair fizzled out.
When a prominent business owner suddenly sold off his assets and left town, Salim and others understood the event as marking the end of the town’s boom. Soon after, political unrest began to grow. The President established a Youth Guard to help maintain order, but he disbanded the group when members started abusing their power. Presumably humiliated by the President’s denunciation, former Youth Guard members formed a Liberation Army, which publicly proclaimed its rejection of the President and his vision of a new Africa.
Increasing violence perpetrated by the Liberation Army led Salim to seek a way out of the country. He decided to travel to London to visit Nazruddin. During his visit, Salim learned about Nazruddin’s disastrous business ventures in Canada and his troubles in London. Salim also felt disenchanted to see so many people “like him” struggling to survive. The experience made him realize the need to reject false ideals about home and security and instead live in the world as it was. Before he left London, Salim got engaged to Nazruddin’s daughter, Kareisha.
Upon returning to the town at the bend in the river, Salim learned that the President had ordered the nationalization of all foreign-owned businesses. An inexperienced and increasingly troublesome African named Théotime now owned the shop and kept Salim on as manager and chauffeur. Desperate to get out of the country for good, Salim started trading illegally in gold and ivory. On a tip from Metty, the police discovered Salim’s hidden cache of prohibited goods, and when Salim refused to pay a bribe, they arrested him.
After days in jail, the arresting officer escorted Salim to see the commissioner, who happened to be Zabeth’s son, Ferdinand. Ferdinand informed Salim that the political situation was deteriorating and counseled him to leave town as soon as possible. The next day, on the eve of the President’s arrival in the town, Salim boarded the steamer and left."
Thy,"The protagonist, who is named Tim O’Brien, begins by describing an event that occurred in the middle of his Vietnam experience. “The Things They Carried” catalogs the variety of things his fellow soldiers in the Alpha Company brought on their missions. Several of these things are intangible, including guilt and fear, while others are specific physical objects, including matches, morphine, M-16 rifles, and M&M’s candy.
Throughout the collection, the same characters reappear in various stories. The first member of the Alpha Company to die is Ted Lavender, a “grunt,” or low-ranking soldier, who deals with his anxiety about the war by taking tranquilizers and smoking marijuana. Lavender is shot in the head on his way back from going to the bathroom, and his superior, Lieutenant Jimmy Cross, blames himself for the tragedy. When Lavender is shot, Cross is distracting himself with thoughts of Martha, a college crush. It is revealed in “Love” that Cross’s feelings for Martha, whom he dated once before leaving for Vietnam, were never reciprocated, and that even twenty years after the war, his guilt over Lavender’s death remains.
In “On the Rainy River,” the narrator, O’Brien, explains the series of events that led him to Vietnam in the first place. He receives his draft notice in June of 1968, and his feelings of confusion drive him north to the Canadian border, which he contemplates crossing so that he will not be forced to fight in a war in which he doesn’t believe. Sitting in a rowboat with the proprietor of the Tip Top Lodge, where he stays, O’Brien decides that his guilt about avoiding the war and fear of disappointing his family are more important than his political convictions. He soon leaves, going first back home to Worthington, Minnesota and later to Vietnam.
In addition to Ted Lavender, a few other members of the Alpha Company are killed during their mission overseas, including Curt Lemon, who is killed when he steps on a rigged mortar round. Though O’Brien is not close to Lemon, in “The Dentist,” he tells a story of how Lemon, who faints before a routine checkup with an army-issued dentist, tries to save face by insisting that a perfectly good tooth be pulled. Lee Strunk, another member of the company, dies from injuries he sustains by stepping on a landmine. In “Friends,” O’Brien remembers that before Strunk was fatally hurt, Strunk and Dave Jensen had made a pact that if either man were irreparably harmed, the other man would see that he was quickly killed. However, when Strunk is actually hurt, he begs Jensen to spare him, and Jensen complies. Instead of being upset by the news of his friend’s swift death en route to treatment, Jensen is relieved.
The death that receives the most attention in The Things They Carried is that of Kiowa, a much-loved member of the Alpha Company and one of O’Brien’s closest friends. In “Speaking of Courage,” the story of Kiowa’s death is relayed in retrospect through the memory of Norman Bowker, years after the war. As Bowker drives around a lake in his Iowa hometown, he thinks that he failed to save Kiowa, who was killed when a mortar round hit and caused him to sink headfirst into a marshy field. O’Brien realizes that he has dealt with his guilt over Kiowa’s death differently than Norman Bowker in “Notes.” Just before the end of the war, O’Brien receives a long letter from Bowker that says he hasn’t found a way to make life meaningful after the war. O’Brien resolves to tell Bowker’s story, and the story of Kiowa’s death, in order to negotiate his own feelings of guilt and hollowness.
Like “Love” and “Notes,” several of O’Brien’s stories are told from a perspective twenty years after the Vietnam War, when he is a forty-three-year-old writer living in Massachusetts. Exposure to the guilt of old friends like Jimmy Cross and Norman Bowker prompts him to write stories in order to understand what they were going through. But two stories, “The Man I Killed” and “Ambush,” are written so that O’Brien can confront his own guilt over killing a man with a grenade outside the village of My Khe. In “The Man I Killed,” O’Brien imagines the life of his victim, from his childhood to the way things would have turned out for him had O’Brien not spotted him on a path and thrown a grenade at his feet. In “Ambush,” O’Brien imagines how he might relay the story of the man he killed to his nine-year-old daughter, Kathleen. In this second story, O’Brien provides more details of the actual killing—including the sound of the grenade and his own feelings—and explains that even well after the fact, he hasn’t finished sorting out the experience.
In the last story, “The Lives of the Dead,” O’Brien gives another twist to his contention that stories have the power to save people. In the stories of Curt Lemon and Kiowa, O’Brien explains that his imagination allowed him to grapple successfully with his guilt and confusion over the death of his fourth-grade first love, Linda."
Purchase,"In “moon,” the first of the four parts of feed, an American teenager named Titus travels to the lunar surface with his high-school friends for spring break, hoping to escape the boredom they feel on Earth. No specific date is revealed, though it’s sometime in a dystopic future, where the moon is fully commercialized and people suffer from red sores called lesions. As Titus and his fellow upper-class friends Link, Marty, Calista, Loga, and Quendy arrive on the moon, readers also get their first glimpse of “the feed.” Although Titus doesn’t initially reveal exact details about the feed or how it works, he says it sends the friends ads and images for where to stay and shop. 
After failing to get into college-age parties, the group visits the Ricochet Lounge, where Titus becomes infatuated with a girl named Violet. She is beautiful and, he soon finds, visiting the moon by herself and is very unlike his friends: She doesn’t make pointless purchases at a mall they all soon visit and isn’t interested in malfunctioning, or falling into a drug-like stupor, via their connections to the feed. Later, when they all visit a dance club called the Rumble Spot, an old man from a dissenter group called the Coalition of Pity hacks into people’s individual feeds, causing them to broadcast the signal, “we enter a time of calamity” over the feed’s network. Police beat the man and “shut off” those hacked, including Titus and Violet, who hold hands as they collapse.
Part 2, “eden,” occurs in a lunar hospital where Violet, Titus, and his friends remain disconnected from the feed until their systems can be scanned for viruses. There, Titus provides additional details about what the feed is and how it works. Feeds are implanted inside the body and connect to a global network that provides news, entertainment, and a means to purchase every kind of product, he says while singing its praises. The feed even anticipates and creates users’ wants from individual profiles based on purchasing decisions, thoughts, and feelings. Titus and Violet grow closer during the stay. Violet, who’s home-schooled and smarter than Titus and his friends, says she hoped to enjoy herself like normal kids but now has a problem, though she remains vague about what this problem is. When doctors finally restore the friends’ feeds, they rejoice. Promotions begin to flow through their minds again, though there’s also ominous news concerning protests over America’s annexation of the moon and resulting anger from a group called the Global Alliance. Still, Titus says, the friends exalt in the return of their feeds.
In Part 3, “Utopia,” Titus and his friends return to Earth and life returns to normal for them: “upcars” travel in tubes past vertically stacked suburbs, the friends party, and U.S. President Trumbull scoffs at reports that claim toxic industries cause lesions. In defiance of rampant consumerism and a loss of individuality, Violet determines to resist the feed by creating a completely random customer profile and asks Titus to join her. Violet, who didn’t receive her feed until she was seven, voices deep concern about the decline of the world and destruction of Earth, and laments how those who’ve had the feed their entire lives are ignorant and self-centered. Titus soon has nightmares that are more likely hacks from the Coalition of Pity. In them, he sees disturbing images of eco destruction and human suffering around the world, but after Violet chats him, saying she has seen the images too, he only wants to go back to sleep.
Before long, Violet’s problem becomes clear: Her body begins to fail and she’s told by doctors that the damage to her feedware can be fatal. The prognosis makes Violet realize how much she wants to do. She starts by going to the seashore with Titus, though they need to dress in protective suits due to its toxicity. Meanwhile, feed chatter reveals that all of Earth’s forests have fallen and there is a growing rift between the U.S. and the Global Alliance. At a party where Quendy shows off her artificial lesions, Violet becomes outraged and her body falters. She chastises Titus and his friends for living in ignorance as the world dies, then collapses and is brought to the hospital. 
Violet’s condition declines further in Part 4, “slumberland,” whose chapter titles track her feed efficiency from a high of 87.3 percent to a low of 4.6 percent, 98 percent being optimal. Aware that she doesn’t have much time, Violet messages Titus a list of twenty-two things she wants to do in life, though he grows increasingly distant, and doesn’t message back. When they do reconnect, Violet sends Titus a recent memory where she falls down a staircase and receives a response from the corporation FeedTech, denying her petition to pay for her system repairs because she wasn’t deemed to be worthy due to her random customer profile. Violet later sends Titus childhood memories to preserve her history, though he deletes them. And when Violet convinces him to visit the mountains with her, one of her life goals, Titus breaks up with her, saying he was only interested in a short relationship while she wanted something eternal. 
Time passes and Titus eventually hears from Violet’s father. At Violet’s home, Titus sees her lying on a floating bed, completely pale, fully incapacitated, and covered in discs. Her father details her final, painful days and how her body failed. He then berates Titus for how badly he treated Violet and for willfully living in ignorance. Titus later visits Violet’s home a second time. Although she appears dead, her feed efficiency is at 4.6 percent and a screen shows that her heart is beating slightly. Nevertheless, Titus tells Violet a story he plans to keep telling her, he says, so she will remember herself. The story is about Violet, the end of America, and their relationship, where they learn something important about love and how to resist the feed. The book ends with a promotion on the feed for Blue-Jean Warehouse’s Final Sales Event and a recurring, fading message that “Everything must go.”"
Prideful,"The news that a wealthy young gentleman named Charles Bingley has rented the manor of Netherfield Park causes a great stir in the nearby village of Longbourn, especially in the Bennet household. The Bennets have five unmarried daughters—from oldest to youngest, Jane, Elizabeth, Mary, Kitty, and Lydia—and Mrs. Bennet is desperate to see them all married. After Mr. Bennet pays a social visit to Mr. Bingley, the Bennets attend a ball at which Mr. Bingley is present. He is taken with Jane and spends much of the evening dancing with her. His close friend, Mr. Darcy, is less pleased with the evening and haughtily refuses to dance with Elizabeth, which makes everyone view him as arrogant and obnoxious.
At social functions over subsequent weeks, however, Mr. Darcy finds himself increasingly attracted to Elizabeth’s charm and intelligence. Jane’s friendship with Mr. Bingley also continues to burgeon, and Jane pays a visit to the Bingley mansion. On her journey to the house she is caught in a downpour and catches ill, forcing her to stay at Netherfield for several days. In order to tend to Jane, Elizabeth hikes through muddy fields and arrives with a spattered dress, much to the disdain of the snobbish Miss Bingley, Charles Bingley’s sister. Miss Bingley’s spite only increases when she notices that Darcy, whom she is pursuing, pays quite a bit of attention to Elizabeth.
When Elizabeth and Jane return home, they find Mr. Collins visiting their household. Mr. Collins is a young clergyman who stands to inherit Mr. Bennet’s property, which has been “entailed,” meaning that it can only be passed down to male heirs. Mr. Collins is a pompous fool, though he is quite enthralled by the Bennet girls. Shortly after his arrival, he makes a proposal of marriage to Elizabeth. She turns him down, wounding his pride. Meanwhile, the Bennet girls have become friendly with militia officers stationed in a nearby town. Among them is Wickham, a handsome young soldier who is friendly toward Elizabeth and tells her how Darcy cruelly cheated him out of an inheritance.
At the beginning of winter, the Bingleys and Darcy leave Netherfield and return to London, much to Jane’s dismay. A further shock arrives with the news that Mr. Collins has become engaged to Charlotte Lucas, Elizabeth’s best friend and the poor daughter of a local knight. Charlotte explains to Elizabeth that she is getting older and needs the match for financial reasons. Charlotte and Mr. Collins get married and Elizabeth promises to visit them at their new home. As winter progresses, Jane visits the city to see friends (hoping also that she might see Mr. Bingley). However, Miss Bingley visits her and behaves rudely, while Mr. Bingley fails to visit her at all. The marriage prospects for the Bennet girls appear bleak.
That spring, Elizabeth visits Charlotte, who now lives near the home of Mr. Collins’s patron, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, who is also Darcy’s aunt. Darcy calls on Lady Catherine and encounters Elizabeth, whose presence leads him to make a number of visits to the Collins’s home, where she is staying. One day, he makes a shocking proposal of marriage, which Elizabeth quickly refuses. She tells Darcy that she considers him arrogant and unpleasant, then scolds him for steering Bingley away from Jane and disinheriting Wickham. Darcy leaves her but shortly thereafter delivers a letter to her. In this letter, he admits that he urged Bingley to distance himself from Jane, but claims he did so only because he thought their romance was not serious. As for Wickham, he informs Elizabeth that the young officer is a liar and that the real cause of their disagreement was Wickham’s attempt to elope with his young sister, Georgiana Darcy.
This letter causes Elizabeth to reevaluate her feelings about Darcy. She returns home and acts coldly toward Wickham. The militia is leaving town, which makes the younger, rather man-crazy Bennet girls distraught. Lydia manages to obtain permission from her father to spend the summer with an old colonel in Brighton, where Wickham’s regiment will be stationed. With the arrival of June, Elizabeth goes on another journey, this time with the Gardiners, who are relatives of the Bennets. The trip takes her to the North and eventually to the neighborhood of Pemberley, Darcy’s estate. She visits Pemberley, after making sure that Darcy is away, and delights in the building and grounds, while hearing from Darcy’s servants that he is a wonderful, generous master. Suddenly, Darcy arrives and behaves cordially toward her. Making no mention of his proposal, he entertains the Gardiners and invites Elizabeth to meet his sister.
Shortly thereafter, however, a letter arrives from home, telling Elizabeth that Lydia has eloped with Wickham and that the couple is nowhere to be found, which suggests that they may be living together out of wedlock. Fearful of the disgrace such a situation would bring on her entire family, Elizabeth hastens home. Mr. Gardiner and Mr. Bennet go off to search for Lydia, but Mr. Bennet eventually returns home empty-handed. Just when all hope seems lost, a letter comes from Mr. Gardiner saying that the couple has been found and that Wickham has agreed to marry Lydia in exchange for an annual income. The Bennets are convinced that Mr. Gardiner has paid off Wickham, but Elizabeth learns that the source of the money, and of her family’s salvation, was none other than Darcy.
Now married, Wickham and Lydia return to Longbourn briefly, where Mr. Bennet treats them coldly. They then depart for Wickham’s new assignment in the North of England. Shortly thereafter, Bingley returns to Netherfield and resumes his courtship of Jane. Darcy goes to stay with him and pays visits to the Bennets but makes no mention of his desire to marry Elizabeth. Bingley, on the other hand, presses his suit and proposes to Jane, to the delight of everyone but Bingley’s haughty sister. While the family celebrates, Lady Catherine de Bourgh pays a visit to Longbourn. She corners Elizabeth and says that she has heard that Darcy, her nephew, is planning to marry her. Since she considers a Bennet an unsuitable match for a Darcy, Lady Catherine demands that Elizabeth promise to refuse him. Elizabeth spiritedly refuses, saying she is not engaged to Darcy, but she will not promise anything against her own happiness. A little later, Elizabeth and Darcy go out walking together and he tells her that his feelings have not altered since the spring. She tenderly accepts his proposal, and both Jane and Elizabeth are married."
Transform,"Gregor Samsa, a traveling salesman, wakes up in his bed to find himself transformed into a large insect. He looks around his room, which appears normal, and decides to go back to sleep to forget about what has happened. He attempts to roll over, only to discover that he cannot due to his new body—he is stuck on his hard, convex back. He tries to scratch an itch on his stomach, but when he touches himself with one of his many new legs, he is disgusted. He reflects on how dreary life as a traveling salesman is and how he would quit if his parents and sister did not depend so much on his income. He turns to the clock and sees that he has overslept and missed his train to work.
Gregor’s mother knocks on the door, and when he answers her, Gregor finds that his voice has changed. His family suspects that he may be ill, so they ask him to open the door, which he keeps locked out of habit. He tries to get out of bed, but he cannot maneuver his transformed body. While struggling to move, he hears his office manager come into the family’s apartment to find out why Gregor has not shown up to work. He eventually rocks himself to the floor and calls out that he will open the door momentarily.
Through the door, the office manager warns Gregor of the consequences of missing work and hints that Gregor’s recent work has not been satisfactory. Gregor protests and tells the office manager that he will be there shortly. Neither his family nor the office manager can understand what Gregor says, and they suspect that something may be seriously wrong with him. Gregor manages to unlock and open the door with his mouth, since he has no hands. He begs the office manager’s forgiveness for his late start. Horrified by Gregor’s appearance, the office manager bolts from the apartment. Gregor tries to catch up with the fleeing office manager, but his father drives him back into the bedroom with a cane and a rolled newspaper. Gregor injures himself squeezing back through the doorway, and his father slams the door shut. Gregor, exhausted, falls asleep.
Gregor wakes and sees that someone has put milk and bread in his room. Initially excited, he quickly discovers that he has no taste for milk, once one of his favorite foods. He settles himself under a couch and listens to the quiet apartment. The next morning, his sister Grete comes in, sees that he has not touched the milk, and replaces it with rotting food scraps, which Gregor happily eats. This begins a routine in which his sister feeds him and cleans up while he hides under the couch, afraid that his appearance will frighten her. Gregor spends his time listening through the wall to his family members talking. They often discuss the difficult financial situation they find themselves in now that Gregor can’t provide for them. Gregor also learns that his mother wants to visit him, but his sister and father will not let her.
Gregor grows more comfortable with his changed body. He begins climbing the walls and ceiling for amusement. Discovering Gregor’s new pastime, Grete decides to remove some of the furniture to give Gregor more space. She and her mother begin taking furniture away, but Gregor finds their actions deeply distressing. He tries to save a picture on the wall of a woman wearing a fur hat, fur scarf, and a fur muff. Gregor’s mother sees him hanging on the wall and passes out. Grete calls out to Gregor—the first time anyone has spoken directly to him since his transformation. Gregor runs out of the room and into the kitchen. His father returns from his new job, and misunderstanding the situation, believes Gregor has tried to attack the mother. The father throws apples at Gregor, and one sinks into his back and remains lodged there. Gregor manages to get back into his bedroom but is severely injured.
Gregor’s family begins leaving the bedroom door open for a few hours each evening so he can watch them. He sees his family wearing down as a result of his transformation and their new poverty. Even Grete seems to resent Gregor now, feeding him and cleaning up with a minimum of effort. The family replaces their maid with a cheap cleaning lady who tolerates Gregor’s appearance and speaks to him occasionally. They also take on three boarders, requiring them to move excess furniture into Gregor’s room, which distresses Gregor. Gregor has also lost his taste for the food Grete brings and he almost entirely ceases eating.
One evening, the cleaning lady leaves Gregor’s door open while the boarders lounge about the living room. Grete has been asked to play the violin for them, and Gregor creeps out of his bedroom to listen. The boarders, who initially seemed interested in Grete, grow bored with her performance, but Gregor is transfixed by it. One of the boarders spots Gregor and they become alarmed. Gregor’s father tries to shove the boarders back into their rooms, but the three men protest and announce that they will move out immediately without paying rent because of the disgusting conditions in the apartment.
Grete tells her parents that they must get rid of Gregor or they will all be ruined. Her father agrees, wishing Gregor could understand them and would leave of his own accord. Gregor does in fact understand and slowly moves back to the bedroom. There, determined to rid his family of his presence, Gregor dies.
Upon discovering that Gregor is dead, the family feels a great sense of relief. The father kicks out the boarders and decides to fire the cleaning lady, who has disposed of Gregor’s body. The family takes a trolley ride out to the countryside, during which they consider their finances. Months of spare living as a result of Gregor’s condition have left them with substantial savings. They decide to move to a better apartment. Grete appears to have her strength and beauty back, which leads her parents to think about finding her a husband."
Runaway,"The Underground Railroad tells the story of Cora, a teenager who runs away from the Georgia plantation where she and her family have been slaves for three generations. Cora’s grandmother Ajarry was brought to the United States from Africa on a slave ship and died after decades working in the fields of the Randall plantation. Cora’s mother, Mabel, ran away, abandoning Cora, and everywhere she goes, Cora looks for answers about her mother’s fate. Left without her mother to protect her, Cora is mistreated by the other slaves, although she shows her fierce nature, challenging a slave named Blake who tries to take her garden plot, and protecting a young slave from the cruel master Terrance. Finally, she escapes with another slave, Caesar. They make it to a stop on the underground railroad, but not before some locals try to capture them and Cora kills a teenage white boy in order to get away. 
The underground railroad, in this novel, is an actual railroad with stations below farms and houses. The first train takes Cora and Caesar to South Carolina, where they are able to live more like free people. The move from Georgia to South Carolina sets the pattern of telling a series of stories about Black experience not just during slavery but throughout American history. 
In South Carolina, Cora and Caesar are met by Sam, a cheerful white station agent who will be their contact during their stay and assigns them new identities. Here, Cora and Caesar are housed, fed, and given jobs. Life is so much better than on the plantation, they are able to ignore things that don’t seem fair. After working as a maid, Cora is sent to work as a “type” in a museum that puts forward a very false, positive version of African and slave life. One night, Cora and Caesar learn from Sam that the hospital they thought was helping them with free medical care is actually conducting government experiments to kill off and sterilize Black people. Then they learn that the slave catcher, Ridgeway, has arrived in search of them. Cora escapes to the underground railroad platform, but Caesar is left behind, and Sam’s house is burned to the ground.
Cora’s next stop is North Carolina, where the situation for Black people, free or fugitive, is much worse. Cora is taken to the home of the reluctant station agent Martin Wells and his wife Edith, who is very upset by Cora’s presence. Cora lives in a small hiding space in the Wells’ attic, where she sees a horrible spectacle take place every Friday night on the town square. North Carolina has worked to expel or kill all Black people in the state, and Friday Festivals are a weekly display of racist propaganda ending with the hanging of a Black person, a grisly act in which the whole town participates. As time goes by, Cora improves her reading in the attic room, but there is no way out for her. Finally, Cora falls ill and has to be cared for in the Wells’ home. Their maid Fiona informs on them, and that Friday night a group of night riders searches the house, finding Cora. With the patrollers is the slave catcher, Ridgeway, who chains Cora to his wagon and takes her with him, while Edith and Martin Wells are hanged from the oak tree.
Tennessee is even worse than North Carolina. Cora is taken through the state by Ridgeway and his two companions, a violent man named Boseman who wears a necklace of human ears, and an odd Black boy named Homer. They also have picked up a runaway named Jasper who constantly sings hymns. The first half of Tennessee they travel through is completely blackened by wildfires. Even the white settlers have been displaced. Halfway into their journey, annoyed by his singing, Ridgeway shoots Jasper in the face. They drive out of the fires, but the next series of towns are in quarantine due to a yellow fever outbreak. Finally, they stop in a town where Cora is acknowledged by a young Black man wearing glasses. After Ridgeway takes Cora to dinner and tells her about Caesar’s death, they stop for the night in the woods outside of town. Boseman tries to rape Cora and Ridgeway punches him. At that instant, the man wearing glasses appears with two others, all armed. One shoots Boseman, another chases Homer, and the man with glasses fights with Ridgeway. Cora jumps on Ridgeway’s back and they subdue him. Homer gets away, Ridgeway is chained to his own wagon, and Cora is rescued.
The man with glasses is Royal, a conductor on the underground railroad, who takes Cora to Valentine farm in Indiana. There she truly lives as a free woman, attending school and contributing to the life of the large farm occupied by free and escaped Black people. She and Royal begin a romance, and she also becomes close to her housemate Sybil and Sybil’s daughter, Molly. Valentine farm was founded by a light-skinned Black man named John Valentine, who often passed for white, and his wife Gloria. Every Saturday night on the farm there is a big feast followed by lectures, poetry readings, singing, and dancing. However, hostility from the nearby white community is growing as the whites feel threatened by the size of the Black community.
Royal takes Cora on a buggy ride and picnic and shows her an abandoned house with an underground railroad station beneath it. It is too small for an actual train and just has a handcar and a narrow tunnel. No one knows where it goes. The experience makes Cora uneasy, since she wants to settle on the Valentine farm and not be forced to flee on the underground railroad anymore. Sam appears on Valentine farm on his way to California and tells Cora that Terrance Randall is dead and no one is looking for her anymore.
On the night that two speakers, Mingo and Lander, debate the future of Valentine farm, a white mob arrives, killing Lander and Royal and many others. They burn down the buildings while the residents flee. Later, people will only know about the farm and the massacre because survivors tell the story to their descendants. Cora is captured by Ridgeway and Homer, who order her to take them to the underground railroad station.
Before the book ends, we learn that Cora’s mother Mabel never made it farther than the swamp bordering the Randall plantation. As she was returning to take care of Cora, she was bitten by a poisonous snake and her body sunk into the swamp.
Cora takes Ridgeway to the abandoned railroad station, where she pulls him down the steps and he is mortally wounded. Homer tends to Ridgeway while Cora pumps the handcar down the tunnel. She travels for miles, then walks until she emerges into daylight. On the trail, she encounters three covered wagons, the last one driven by an older Black man named Ollie. He feeds her and tells her he is going to St. Louis to join a wagon train to California. She joins him and wonders about his story, which he will certainly tell her on the way."
Gone,"It is the spring of 1861. Scarlett O’Hara, a pretty Southern belle, lives on Tara, a large plantation in Georgia. She concerns herself only with her numerous suitors and her desire to marry Ashley Wilkes. One day she hears that Ashley is engaged to Melanie Hamilton, his frail, plain cousin from Atlanta. At a barbecue at the Wilkes plantation the next day, Scarlett confesses her feelings to Ashley. He tells her that he does love her but that he is marrying Melanie because she is similar to him, whereas he and Scarlett are very different. Scarlett slaps Ashley and he leaves the room. Suddenly Scarlett realizes that she is not alone. Rhett Butler, a scandalous but dashing adventurer, has been watching the whole scene, and he compliments Scarlett on being unladylike. 
The Civil War begins. Charles Hamilton, Melanie’s timid, dull brother, proposes to Scarlett. She spitefully agrees to marry him, hoping to hurt Ashley. Over the course of two months, Scarlett and Charles marry, Charles joins the army and dies of the measles, and Scarlett learns that she is pregnant. After Scarlett gives birth to a son, Wade, she becomes bored and unhappy. She makes a long trip to Atlanta to stay with Melanie and Melanie’s aunt, Pittypat. The busy city agrees with Scarlett’s temperament, and she begins to see a great deal of Rhett. Rhett infuriates Scarlett with his bluntness and mockery, but he also encourages her to flout the severely restrictive social requirements for mourning Southern widows. As the war progresses, food and clothing run scarce in Atlanta. Scarlett and Melanie fear for Ashley’s safety. After the bloody battle of Gettysburg, Ashley is captured and sent to prison, and the Yankee army begins bearing down on Atlanta. Scarlett desperately wants to return home to Tara, but she has promised Ashley she will stay with the pregnant Melanie, who could give birth at any time.
	On the night the Yankees capture Atlanta and set it afire, Melanie gives birth to her son, Beau. Rhett helps Scarlett and Melanie escape the Yankees, escorting them through the burning streets of the city, but he abandons them outside Atlanta so he can join the Confederate Army. Scarlett drives the cart all night and day through a dangerous forest full of deserters and soldiers, at last reaching Tara. She arrives to find that her mother, Ellen, is dead; her father, Gerald, has lost his mind; and the Yankee army has looted the plantation, leaving no food or cotton. Scavenging for subsistence, a furious Scarlett vows never to go hungry again.
	Scarlett takes charge of rebuilding Tara. She murders a Yankee thief and puts out a fire set by a spiteful Yankee soldier. At last the war ends, word comes that Ashley is free and on his way home, and a stream of returning soldiers begins pouring through Tara. One such soldier, a one-legged homeless Confederate named Will Benteen, stays on and helps Scarlett with the plantation. One day, Will brings terrible news: Jonas Wilkerson, a former employee at Tara and current government official, has raised the taxes on Tara, hoping to drive the O’Haras out so that he might buy the plantation. Distraught, Scarlett hurries to Atlanta to seduce Rhett Butler so that he will give her the three hundred dollars she needs for taxes. Rhett has emerged from the war a fabulously wealthy man, dripping with earnings from his blockade-running operation and from food speculation. However, Rhett is in a Yankee jail and cannot help Scarlett. Scarlett sees her sister’s beau, Frank Kennedy, who now owns a general store, and forges a plan. Determined to save Tara, she betrays her sister and marries Frank, pays the taxes on Tara, and devotes herself to making Frank’s business more profitable.
	After Rhett blackmails his way out of prison, he lends Scarlett enough money to buy a sawmill. To the displeasure of Atlanta society, Scarlett becomes a shrewd businesswoman. Gerald dies, and Scarlett returns to Tara for the funeral. There, she persuades Ashley and Melanie to move to Atlanta and accept a share in her lumber business. Shortly thereafter, Scarlett gives birth to Frank’s child, Ella Lorena.
	A free black man and his white male companion attack Scarlett on her way home from the sawmill one day. That night, the Ku Klux Klan avenges the attack on Scarlett, and Frank ends up dead. Rhett proposes to Scarlett and she quickly accepts. After a long, luxurious honeymoon in New Orleans, Scarlett and Rhett return to Atlanta, where Scarlett builds a garish mansion and socializes with wealthy Yankees. Scarlett becomes pregnant again and has another child, Bonnie Blue Butler. Rhett dotes on the girl and begins a successful campaign to win back the good graces of the prominent Atlanta citizens in order to keep Bonnie from being an outcast like Scarlett.
	Scarlett and Rhett’s marriage begins happily, but Rhett becomes increasingly bitter and indifferent toward her. Scarlett’s feelings for Ashley have diminished into a warm, sympathetic friendship, but Ashley’s jealous sister, India, finds them in a friendly embrace and spreads the rumor that they are having an affair. To Scarlett’s surprise, Melanie takes Scarlett’s side and refuses to believe the rumors.
	After Bonnie is killed in a horse-riding accident, Rhett nearly loses his mind, and his marriage with Scarlett worsens. Not long after the funeral, Melanie has a miscarriage and falls very ill. Distraught, Scarlett hurries to see her. Melanie makes Scarlett promise to look after Ashley and Beau. Scarlett realizes that she loves and depends on Melanie and that Ashley has been only a fantasy for her. She concludes that she truly loves Rhett. After Melanie dies, Scarlett hurries to tell Rhett of her revelation. Rhett, however, says that he has lost his love for Scarlett, and he leaves her. Grief-stricken and alone, Scarlett makes up her mind to go back to Tara to recover her strength in the comforting arms of her childhood nurse and slave, Mammy, and to think of a way to win Rhett back."
Savings,"A Raisin in the Sun portrays a few weeks in the life of the Youngers, a Black family living on the South Side of Chicago in the 1950s. When the play opens, the Youngers are about to receive an insurance check for $10,000. This money comes from the deceased Mr. Younger’s life insurance policy. Each of the adult members of the family has an idea as to what he or she would like to do with this money. The matriarch of the family, Mama, wants to buy a house to fulfill a dream she shared with her husband. Mama’s son, Walter Lee, would rather use the money to invest in a liquor store with his friends. He believes that the investment will solve the family’s financial problems forever. Walter’s wife, Ruth, agrees with Mama, however, and hopes that she and Walter can provide more space and opportunity for their son, Travis. Finally, Beneatha, Walter’s sister and Mama’s daughter, wants to use the money for her medical school tuition. She also wishes that her family members were not so interested in assimilating into the white world. Beneatha instead tries to find her identity by looking back to the past and to Africa.
As the play progresses, the Youngers clash over their competing dreams. Ruth discovers that she is pregnant but fears that if she has the child, she will put more financial pressure on her family members. When Walter says nothing to Ruth’s admission that she is considering abortion, Mama puts a down payment on a house for the whole family. She believes that a bigger, brighter dwelling will help them all. This house is in Clybourne Park, an entirely white neighborhood. When the Youngers’ future neighbors find out that the Youngers are moving in, they send Mr. Lindner, from the Clybourne Park Improvement Association, to offer the Youngers money in return for staying away. The Youngers refuse the deal, even after Walter loses the rest of the money ($6,500) to his friend Willy Harris, who persuades Walter to invest in the liquor store and then runs off with his cash.
In the meantime, Beneatha rejects her suitor, George Murchison, whom she believes to be shallow and blind to the problems of race. Subsequently, she receives a marriage proposal from her Nigerian boyfriend, Joseph Asagai, who wants Beneatha to get a medical degree and move to Africa with him (Beneatha does not make her choice before the end of the play). The Youngers eventually move out of the apartment, fulfilling the family’s long-held dream. Their future seems uncertain and slightly dangerous, but they are optimistic and determined to live a better life. They believe that they can succeed if they stick together as a family and resolve to defer their dreams no longer."
Promotions,"In “moon,” the first of the four parts of feed, an American teenager named Titus travels to the lunar surface with his high-school friends for spring break, hoping to escape the boredom they feel on Earth. No specific date is revealed, though it’s sometime in a dystopic future, where the moon is fully commercialized and people suffer from red sores called lesions. As Titus and his fellow upper-class friends Link, Marty, Calista, Loga, and Quendy arrive on the moon, readers also get their first glimpse of “the feed.” Although Titus doesn’t initially reveal exact details about the feed or how it works, he says it sends the friends ads and images for where to stay and shop. 
After failing to get into college-age parties, the group visits the Ricochet Lounge, where Titus becomes infatuated with a girl named Violet. She is beautiful and, he soon finds, visiting the moon by herself and is very unlike his friends: She doesn’t make pointless purchases at a mall they all soon visit and isn’t interested in malfunctioning, or falling into a drug-like stupor, via their connections to the feed. Later, when they all visit a dance club called the Rumble Spot, an old man from a dissenter group called the Coalition of Pity hacks into people’s individual feeds, causing them to broadcast the signal, “we enter a time of calamity” over the feed’s network. Police beat the man and “shut off” those hacked, including Titus and Violet, who hold hands as they collapse.
Part 2, “eden,” occurs in a lunar hospital where Violet, Titus, and his friends remain disconnected from the feed until their systems can be scanned for viruses. There, Titus provides additional details about what the feed is and how it works. Feeds are implanted inside the body and connect to a global network that provides news, entertainment, and a means to purchase every kind of product, he says while singing its praises. The feed even anticipates and creates users’ wants from individual profiles based on purchasing decisions, thoughts, and feelings. Titus and Violet grow closer during the stay. Violet, who’s home-schooled and smarter than Titus and his friends, says she hoped to enjoy herself like normal kids but now has a problem, though she remains vague about what this problem is. When doctors finally restore the friends’ feeds, they rejoice. Promotions begin to flow through their minds again, though there’s also ominous news concerning protests over America’s annexation of the moon and resulting anger from a group called the Global Alliance. Still, Titus says, the friends exalt in the return of their feeds.
In Part 3, “Utopia,” Titus and his friends return to Earth and life returns to normal for them: “upcars” travel in tubes past vertically stacked suburbs, the friends party, and U.S. President Trumbull scoffs at reports that claim toxic industries cause lesions. In defiance of rampant consumerism and a loss of individuality, Violet determines to resist the feed by creating a completely random customer profile and asks Titus to join her. Violet, who didn’t receive her feed until she was seven, voices deep concern about the decline of the world and destruction of Earth, and laments how those who’ve had the feed their entire lives are ignorant and self-centered. Titus soon has nightmares that are more likely hacks from the Coalition of Pity. In them, he sees disturbing images of eco destruction and human suffering around the world, but after Violet chats him, saying she has seen the images too, he only wants to go back to sleep.
Before long, Violet’s problem becomes clear: Her body begins to fail and she’s told by doctors that the damage to her feedware can be fatal. The prognosis makes Violet realize how much she wants to do. She starts by going to the seashore with Titus, though they need to dress in protective suits due to its toxicity. Meanwhile, feed chatter reveals that all of Earth’s forests have fallen and there is a growing rift between the U.S. and the Global Alliance. At a party where Quendy shows off her artificial lesions, Violet becomes outraged and her body falters. She chastises Titus and his friends for living in ignorance as the world dies, then collapses and is brought to the hospital. 
Violet’s condition declines further in Part 4, “slumberland,” whose chapter titles track her feed efficiency from a high of 87.3 percent to a low of 4.6 percent, 98 percent being optimal. Aware that she doesn’t have much time, Violet messages Titus a list of twenty-two things she wants to do in life, though he grows increasingly distant, and doesn’t message back. When they do reconnect, Violet sends Titus a recent memory where she falls down a staircase and receives a response from the corporation FeedTech, denying her petition to pay for her system repairs because she wasn’t deemed to be worthy due to her random customer profile. Violet later sends Titus childhood memories to preserve her history, though he deletes them. And when Violet convinces him to visit the mountains with her, one of her life goals, Titus breaks up with her, saying he was only interested in a short relationship while she wanted something eternal. 
Time passes and Titus eventually hears from Violet’s father. At Violet’s home, Titus sees her lying on a floating bed, completely pale, fully incapacitated, and covered in discs. Her father details her final, painful days and how her body failed. He then berates Titus for how badly he treated Violet and for willfully living in ignorance. Titus later visits Violet’s home a second time. Although she appears dead, her feed efficiency is at 4.6 percent and a screen shows that her heart is beating slightly. Nevertheless, Titus tells Violet a story he plans to keep telling her, he says, so she will remember herself. The story is about Violet, the end of America, and their relationship, where they learn something important about love and how to resist the feed. The book ends with a promotion on the feed for Blue-Jean Warehouse’s Final Sales Event and a recurring, fading message that “Everything must go.”"
Adjust,"Educated is primarily retrospective, consisting of Tara Westover's memories about her past. She tells the story of the events of her life from a vantage point in her late twenties, occasionally interjecting to comment on the process of trying to arrive at an accurate version of the past. Tara was born the youngest of seven children to parents whom she refers to as Faye and Gene (pseudonyms). The Westover family lived on a farm in rural Idaho, where Gene made a living salvaging scrap metal while Faye worked as an unlicensed midwife and herbal healer. Gene suffered from paranoid fears about interference from the federal government, and as a result he refused to allow his children to attend school, receive birth certificates, or receive medical attention. Gene was also a devout Mormon who believed in radical self-sufficiency and an impending Day of Judgement.
		
Shifts in the Westover family dynamic began to emerge when Tara was about nine. Her mother's work as a midwife increased her sense of independence, but after sustaining a serious and untreated brain injury in a car accident, Faye began to lose confidence in her skills, and focused instead on using herbal remedies and a form of intuitive healing. Around this time, Tyler (the third son) announced that he was going to attend college, which estranged him from his family. Tyler's absence forced Tara to become more involved in helping her father with his scrapping work, which left her constantly exposed to the possibility of dangerous injury. It also made her more curious about possibly pursuing an education herself. When Tara was ten, she told her disapproving father that she wanted to begin going to school, but nothing came of the idea.
As Tara grew into her teens, she acquired more independence from her family due to taking on various jobs and pursuing singing and musical theatre in the local community. However, her life was dominated by the strict rules and religious doctrine her father imposed, and Tara often worried about becoming sinful. When Tara was thirteen, her older brother Shawn moved back home. At first Shawn and Tara were close and spent a lot of time together. When Tara was about fifteen, however, Shawn began to be physically abusive toward her. His behavior only got worse after Shawn experienced a head injury. Tyler eventually realized that Shawn was hurting Tara, and he urged Tara to seriously consider applying to college and getting away from the family. Although she was uncertain at first, Tara began to study and was eventually accepted at Brigham Young University, having passed herself off as homeschooled.
In January 2004, when Tara was seventeen years old, she moved to Utah to begin her college education. She found the adjustment very difficult at first, but eventually began to excel in her studies. Tara's finances were precarious, and she had to hold multiple jobs and maintain very high grades to retain her scholarship. Her emerging independence also caused a threatening dynamic between her, Gene, and Shawn. Whenever Tara returned to Buck's Peak, her father manipulated her into working for him, while Shawn continued to physically and emotionally abuse her. Tara eventually confided to a bishop about her life, and he helped her to secure funding to finance her education. Tara's studies, and the people she met, also gradually opened her eyes to different realities and force her to realize how damaging and isolating her childhood has been. Tara eventually changed her major to studying history, and is encouraged to apply for a study abroad program at Cambridge University in England.
Tara's experience at Cambridge broadened her horizons even further, and she was encouraged to consider graduate studies. Tara still felt isolated from her peers, and ashamed of her origins. She hid most of her past even from her friends and the men she occasionally dated. She was eventually awarded a prestigious Cambridge Gates Fellowship and moved to England to pursue a Master's degree. She remained in close contact with her family and returned to Idaho regularly to visit, but her relationship with them deteriorated. Shawn was growing increasingly erratic and violent, and Tara feared for the safety of his wife and young child. By chance, she revealed to her sister Audrey that Shawn had been abusive with her, and Audrey later confided that Shawn abused her as well. Audrey blamed herself for not protecting her younger sister, and suggested that she and Tara confront their parents and Shawn about what happened to them.
By then Tara had built a happy life for herself in England, and was working on a PhD in history at Cambridge. However, the attempt to speak the truth quickly became a source of conflict in the family. Tara became more and more ostracized within her family, eventually culminating in Shawn learning that she had been telling their parents about the abuse she suffered. Realizing her family would never trust her claims, Tara became estranged from most of them, with the exception of Tyler.  The estrangement from her family prompted grief and depression for Tara, but she was finally able to heal, and successfully completed her PhD. By the end of her memoir, Tara has accepted that she may never have a relationship with her family again, but she takes pride in the independence she has established, and the life she has built for herself."
Conference,"Speak, by Laurie Halse Anderson, chronicles the struggles of thirteen-year-old Melinda Sordino after she is a raped by at a party the summer before her freshman year of high school by another student. Melinda tells her story in first person narrative. She describes events within the framework of the four marking periods of the school year.
In the opening part of Speak, “First Marking Period,” Melinda begins high school, and we learn that former friends now hate her. She experiences humiliation in the cafeteria and Mr. Neck, a social studies teacher, further embarrasses her by giving her demerits on the first day of school. Ostracized by her former friends, she befriends Heather, a new girl at the school. Heather seeks popularity, and she badgers Melinda to join various clubs. Rachel, Melinda’s ex-best friend, hasn’t tried to find out the truth about what really happened to Melinda that night at the party over the summer.
Melinda describes her classes, activities, and thoughts. Her project in Mr. Freeman’s art class is to create a work of art based on a “tree,” which is the object named on the piece of paper she randomly chooses. In biology, Melinda thinks that David Petrakis, her lab partner, might be cute without the braces. And in algebra, when Mr. Stetman has Rachel come to the board to help Melinda with a problem, Melinda is humiliated. 
Melinda often skips class using stolen late passes and doesn’t complete her homework. She finds refuge at school in a vacant janitor’s closet, which she turns into her “burrow.” At the Homecoming Rally, students bully her for being the one who called the cops that night at the party.
At home, Melinda and her parents communicate with each other by leaving notes on the refrigerator. In her bedroom, she no longer wants to look in the mirror and puts it in the back of her closet. Toward the end of the marking period, Melinda’s parents hear from the school about her missing work, and she remains silent while they berate her for failing. Through it all, Melinda sees “IT” everywhere, the nightmare from which she cannot awaken.
In “Second Marking Period,” school is a grind for Melinda. At her parents’ insistence, she stays after to finish her homework, but she goes to her burrow and naps instead. In social studies, David Petrakis stands up against Mr. Neck’s racist rant about immigration. In biology, she finds that a seed within the apple she has cut is already growing. Heather gives her an early Christmas present, and Melinda decides she’ll give Heather a friendship necklace. 
On Christmas, Melinda nearly tells her parents what happened that night last summer but can’t. Winter break is miserable. Her parents keep her busy working for them, and she is relieved when school starts again. 
In gym class, Melinda impresses the basketball coaches with skills but has no interest in being on the team. She reluctantly helps Heather in her attempts to become an initiated member of a do-good club. And in biology, when she and David dissect a frog, she faints when preparing to slice it open. 
Melinda’s parents receive another call from the guidance counselor about her grades. After their verbal assault, Melinda goes to her room and uses an open paper clip to scrape at her wrist. 
“IT”, who we learn is Andy Evans, harasses Melinda in the cafeteria, and she runs to the bathroom to vomit. She has yet to tell anyone, even the reader, about what happened that summer night.
In “Third Marking Period,” Melinda continues to skip school and avoid Andy Evans. Heather ends their friendship suddenly, and later returns the friendship necklace Melinda had given her for Christmas. No one, Melinda is sure, “would like the inside girl I think I am.” 
The school counselors hold another meeting with Melinda’s parents, who berate and threaten her. She refuses to talk or defend herself. She receives In-School Suspension, and IT is there. He sits next to her and blows in her ear when Mr. Neck isn’t looking. 
In art class, Mr. Freeman gives Melinda a book about Picasso to help her “paralyzed” imagination. Picasso’s art inspires her, and she begins to draw. Mr. Freeman recognizes that she has a lot to say.
Melinda works to meet the expectations set for her. Yet, with “no friends in the known universe,” Melinda sits alone at lunch, wondering if everyone is talking and laughing about her. 
One afternoon, after a basketball game, David Petrakis invites her to his house for pizza to celebrate the team’s one-point win. She declines, torn between getting a life, and the fact that the world is a dangerous place.
At last, Melinda reveals that she was attacked at a party last summer, though she does not use the word “rape.” At this point, we (the readers) are the only ones besides Melinda who know what happened.
In “Fourth Marking Period,” Melinda takes her ex-friend Ivy’s advice and tries drawing a tree instead of carving one from linoleum block. She also learns that Rachel is dating Andy Evans. Compelled to do something, she writes a note to Rachel warning her about Andy. In the note, she admits for the first time (but without divulging her identity), that she was raped. 
Springtime arrives, and Melinda finds solace working in the garden. She and David plan a protest in social studies class over an oral report she is supposed to present, and she stands up to Heather by refusing to help her decorate for the Senior Prom. She writes on a stall in the bathroom, “Guys to Stay Away From: Andy Evans.” Andy Evans continues to bully her. 
Melinda feels compelled to tell Rachel the truth about Andy and what happened that night. But, when Rachel learns that Andy Evans was Melinda’s attacker, she accuses Melinda of being jealous and calls her a “twisted little freak.” Later, Ivy brings Melinda into the bathroom stall. Other girls have added words like “creep” and “bastard” under Andy Evan’s name. Seeing that, Melinda feels like she can fly.
Melinda realizes she doesn’t need her burrow anymore. When she is clearing her items out of the closet, Andy Evans barges in, attacks Melinda, and tries to rape her again. She finds her voice and screams “NNNOOO!!” He does not back off, so Melinda breaks a mirror, takes a shard of glass, and holds it to his neck. “I said no,” she tells him. People who had heard her scream run for help.
With hours left in the school year, Melinda finds herself a sort of hero. She finishes her tree project, receiving an A+ from Mr. Freeman."
Succeed,"In Outliers: The Story of Success, Malcolm Gladwell considers the circumstances that lead to success. The first half of the book looks closely at how opportunities matter more in the lives of successful people than hard work or raw talent. The second half of the book focuses on cultural legacies: behavioral tendencies rooted in their ancestral past.
Part One examines the role of opportunity in the lives of extremely successful people. Gladwell’s first example is the Canadian Hockey League, the world’s most competitive youth hockey league. Since the cutoff date for the Canadian leagues that serve the youngest players is January 1, those born in the first part of the calendar year are much larger and more coordinated than their peers. The larger and more coordinated kids are given more playing time and better coaching, and thus become better players by the time they reach the top league. An overwhelming majority of Canadian professional hockey players have birthdays in January, February or March.
Gladwell proposes that 10,000 hours of practice is needed to master a skill, even for prodigies like Mozart. Bill Joy, Bill Gates, and the Beatles all worked hard to achieve success but benefited from opportunities they did not create. Joy, one of the founders of Sun Microsystems, happened to attend one of the first colleges in the world with a time-sharing terminal. In graduate school, he had a terminal in his room, where he spent all of his free time programming. Gates happened to attend a private high school with a time-sharing terminal connected to a mainframe in Seattle. He also was able to spend all of his free time programming. Early on, the Beatles were hired to play long shows day after day in Hamburg, Germany. 
Birth year or era is another form of opportunity. Gates and Joy (as well as other early programmers) all reached the end of their teen years just as personal computers became available to the public. In another example, fourteen of the top seventy-five richest people in the history of the world happened to be alive at the same time, in the same country: the United States in the mid-1800s.
Opportunity matters more than an individual’s IQ. Using a study conducted by Lewis Terman, the creator of the Stanford-Binet IQ test, Gladwell shows that “practical intelligence” is as important as “analytical intelligence.” He also contrasts Chris Langan, one of the world’s smartest living people, with Robert Oppenheimer. While both had difficulties in college, only Oppenheimer had a successful life, due to his practical intelligence.
The last portion of Part One looks at Joe Flom, a successful lawyer from New York City. While he was born into a poor family to Jewish immigrants (in a time when Jewish immigrants were not treated well), many of the disadvantages in his life were actually benefits and directly contributed to his success.
Part Two investigates cultural legacies. Using flight recorder transcripts from several plane crashes from the last few decades, Gladwell shows that cultural expectations and habits can be a severe hindrance to pilots. Copilots from countries that have a high “Power Distance Index” (those that show the most deference to authority) will often avoid telling pilots that they are making mistakes, even when the mistakes are potentially fatal. After recognizing the dangers of such cultural expectations, commercial aviation has instituted programs to change the way flight crews talk with one another. 
Gladwell next analyzes the disparity in public school math test scores between Eastern and Western countries. He suggests that the cultures in which rice paddy farming is historically important have a stronger work ethic. Using various examples, Gladwell shows that hard work has a greater impact on success in learning mathematics than intelligence. 
The final example is an examination of the KIPP school in the South Bronx and the “achievement gap” between socioeconomic groups. American students from middle-class and affluent households retain more information over summer vacation and are more likely to make additional gains than students from low-income households. The KIPP school uses longer school days and summer programming to eliminate the achievement gap for low-income children. While the work schedule is very rigorous, the school’s students go on to great academic success.
Gladwell demonstrates that if more opportunities were available, there would be far more successful people and the world would be richer for it."
Looking,"Looking for Alaska tells the story of Miles “Pudge” Halter, a high school junior who divides his life into time before and time after a life-changing event that the reader will not discover until later in the novel. 
Miles plans to attend the Culver Creek boarding school for his junior year of high school. Although his parents worry that Miles wants to attend the school because he does not have friends at his current school, Miles reveals that he is actually influenced by the last words of the poet François Rabelais about “seeking the Great Perhaps.” He moves to Birmingham, Alabama to attend Culver Creek and becomes friends with his roommate, Chip “The Colonel” Martin. Chip teaches Miles about the social structure of the school. He explains that the wealthy students that go home to their parents’ mansions every weekend (the “Weekday Warriors”) do not get along with his friend group. 
Chip introduces Miles to his friend Alaska, and Miles is quickly enamored by her. While Miles is obsessed with people’s final words and wants to seek François Rabelais’s “Great Perhaps,” Alaska enjoys books and wants to know the nature of “the labyrinth of suffering” that Simón Bolívar evoked in his final words.
The Weekday Warriors sneak into Chip and Miles’s dorm on Miles’s first night and throw Miles into the lake with his limbs bound by tape. Chip and Miles discover that this action was taken in retaliation for Chip supposedly ratting out their friends—a couple named Marya and Paul—and getting them expelled the previous year. Miles, Chip, Alaska, and another friend, Takumi, begin planning a revenge prank. Miles becomes part of their friend group and starts smoking cigarettes. The four of them get caught smoking and Alaska and Chip cover for Miles and Takumi, demonstrating to Miles that you cover for your friends instead of ratting them out. 
Miles settles into his new school and does well in his classes because he spends so much time studying. Alaska decides she will find Miles a girlfriend, and eventually introduces him to a Romanian student named Lara. Miles embarrasses himself on the first group date at a basketball game with Alaska, Alaska’s boyfriend Jake, Chip, Chip’s girlfriend Sara, Takumi, and Lara. Miles is hit by a basketball, gets concussed, and then vomits on Lara. Afterward, Miles tries to talk to Alaska, but is confused when Alaska becomes moody and short with him for no apparent reason.
The Weekday Warriors target Alaska with a prank, reminding Chip and Alaska they need to work on their own revenge prank. Takumi reveals to Miles that it was actually Alaska who ratted out the couple who were expelled the previous year. Takumi warns Miles that he cannot rat anyone else out if he gets caught carrying out the revenge prank. Miles is still infatuated with Alaska and asks his parents to let him stay at school over Thanksgiving break so he can be with her. Although he knows she has a boyfriend, Miles wants to be with Alaska. They ultimately spend Thanksgiving Day with Chip and his mom.
Lara joins Alaska, Chip, Takumi, and Miles as they execute their revenge prank on the Weekday Warriors. They set off fireworks and put dye in the Weekday Warriors’ hair products. They also get on the computer of the Dean (whom they call “the Eagle”) to send bad grade reports to the parents of the Weekday Warriors. The five of them spend the remainder of the night and weekend camping and hiding in a barn on campus as their alibi is that they were all off campus. They play a drinking game and Alaska reveals that, as a child, she saw her mom die of an aneurysm and did not call an ambulance because she thought her mom was just sleeping. When they quit playing the drinking game, Miles kisses Lara. He asks if she wants to be his girlfriend and she says yes. 
Miles spends time with Lara despite not having much to talk about, but they are physically intimate. He leaves Lara to spend time with Alaska and Chip in his room, watching them as they get drunk. Alaska dares Miles to make out with her. He does and she tells him it is to be continued in the future. They all go to sleep. Chip and Miles are startled awake later by Alaska frantically telling them she needs to leave because she had forgotten something. They provide a distraction for the Eagle so she can get in her car and drive away unnoticed.
The Eagle calls an assembly to announce to the student body that Alaska has died. Miles asks what happened and is informed that she drove straight into a police cruiser with its lights and sirens on, likely due to driving while intoxicated. Both Chip and Miles feel responsible for her death because they helped her drive away when they knew she was drunk. They mourn in different ways and attend Alaska’s funeral.
Miles and Chip go through Alaska’s room to see if there is anything they want to keep. They find a note she wrote in one of her books that said “straight and fast” was the way out of the labyrinth of suffering. This revelation makes Chip and Miles think she may have killed herself. Chip is eager to investigate her death and Miles reluctantly agrees to help. 
Religion class becomes more important to Miles after Alaska’s death because its subject matter becomes more real. Chip and Miles vent their anger to each other that so many people who did not know Alaska like they did are mourning her death. Chip leads their investigation into Alaska’s death. 
Chip and Miles interview the police officer who saw Alaska crash. Their interview supports their belief that she killed herself, so they research suicide warning signs. They do not remember Alaska exhibiting many of the warning signs and continue their investigation. Meanwhile, Miles avoids Lara. Takumi questions Miles about whether he is still dating Lara, and Takumi demands that Chip and Miles tell him about what they have been doing. They agree to tell him about their investigation in the future. 
Chip plans to see if Alaska might have been unable to swerve because of how drunk she was. He and Miles steal a breathalyzer from the Eagle and Chip drinks enough alcohol to match Alaska’s blood alcohol level at her time of death. He believes she would have been able to swerve, so he plans to call Jake, Alaska’s boyfriend, as a final effort. Miles is against calling Jake, but Chip does it anyway. They learn that Alaska told Jake that she would call him later, which further confuses the question of whether she killed herself or not.
Chip and Miles do not know what to investigate next, so they turn their attention to planning a prank in memory of Alaska. Chip pulls out plans Alaska had made for a prank, and Chip and Miles recruit other juniors at the school to execute it. They hire a male stripper, posing as a psychologist, to give a presentation at a Speaker’s Day event at their school. He delivers a speech about subverting the patriarchal paradigm and performs in front of the whole student body. 
Later in the year, Takumi points out to Chip and Miles that the date of Alaska’s death coincides with the date of the story Alaska shared with them about her mother’s death when they played a drinking game in the barn. The boys realize she must have forgotten the anniversary of her mother’s death and was driving to her grave to deliver flowers. Although they still feel guilty for helping her drive away drunk, and they do not know for sure whether it was an accident or suicide, they feel like they now have the closure they needed. 
“Straight and fast” was Alaska’s way out of the labyrinth of suffering, but Miles decides to choose the labyrinth over an escape. Miles feels more confident about seeking the Great Perhaps, despite the grief he experienced by loving and losing Alaska."
Massachusetts,"In the Puritan New England town of Salem, Massachusetts, a group of girls goes dancing in the forest with a black slave named Tituba. While dancing, they are caught by the local minister, Reverend Parris. One of the girls, Parris’s daughter Betty, falls into a coma-like state. A crowd gathers in the Parris home while rumors of witchcraft fill the town. Having sent for Reverend Hale, an expert on witchcraft, Parris questions Abigail Williams, the girls’ ringleader, about the events that took place in the forest. Abigail, who is Parris’s niece and ward, admits to doing nothing beyond “dancing.”
While Parris tries to calm the crowd that has gathered in his home, Abigail talks to some of the other girls, telling them not to admit to anything. John Proctor, a local farmer, then enters and talks to Abigail alone. Unbeknownst to anyone else in the town, while working in Proctor’s home the previous year she engaged in an affair with him, which led to her being fired by his wife, Elizabeth. Abigail still desires Proctor, but he fends her off and tells her to end her foolishness with the girls.
Betty wakes up and begins screaming. Much of the crowd rushes upstairs and gathers in her bedroom, arguing over whether she is bewitched. A separate argument between Proctor, Parris, the argumentative Giles Corey, and the wealthy Thomas Putnam soon ensues. This dispute centers on money and land deeds, and it suggests that deep fault lines run through the Salem community. As the men argue, Reverend Hale arrives and examines Betty, while Proctor departs. Hale quizzes Abigail about the girls’ activities in the forest, grows suspicious of her behavior, and demands to speak to Tituba. After Parris and Hale interrogate her for a brief time, Tituba confesses to communing with the devil, and she hysterically accuses various townsfolk of consorting with the devil. Suddenly, Abigail joins her, confessing to having seen the devil conspiring and cavorting with other townspeople. Betty joins them in naming witches, and the crowd is thrown into an uproar.
A week later, alone in their farmhouse outside of town, John and Elizabeth Proctor discuss the ongoing trials and the escalating number of townsfolk who have been accused of being witches. Elizabeth urges her husband to denounce Abigail as a fraud; he refuses, and she becomes jealous, accusing him of still harboring feelings for her. Mary Warren, their servant and one of Abigail’s circle, returns from Salem with news that Elizabeth has been accused of witchcraft but the court did not pursue the accusation. Mary is sent up to bed, and John and Elizabeth continue their argument, only to be interrupted by a visit from Reverend Hale. While they discuss matters, Giles Corey and Francis Nurse come to the Proctor home with news that their wives have been arrested. Officers of the court suddenly arrive and arrest Elizabeth. After they have taken her, Proctor browbeats Mary, insisting that she must go to Salem and expose Abigail and the other girls as frauds.
The next day, Proctor brings Mary to court and tells Judge Danforth that she will testify that the girls are lying. Danforth is suspicious of Proctor’s motives and tells Proctor, truthfully, that Elizabeth is pregnant and will be spared for a time. Proctor persists in his charge, convincing Danforth to allow Mary to testify. Mary tells the court that the girls are lying. When the girls are brought in, they turn the tables by accusing Mary of bewitching them. Furious, Proctor confesses his affair with Abigail and accuses her of being motivated by jealousy of his wife. To test Proctor’s claim, Danforth summons Elizabeth and asks her if Proctor has been unfaithful to her. Despite her natural honesty, she lies to protect Proctor’s honor, and Danforth denounces Proctor as a liar. Meanwhile, Abigail and the girls again pretend that Mary is bewitching them, and Mary breaks down and accuses Proctor of being a witch. Proctor rages against her and against the court. He is arrested, and Hale quits the proceedings.
The summer passes and autumn arrives. The witch trials have caused unrest in neighboring towns, and Danforth grows nervous. Abigail has run away, taking all of Parris’s money with her. Hale, who has lost faith in the court, begs the accused witches to confess falsely in order to save their lives, but they refuse. Danforth, however, has an idea: he asks Elizabeth to talk John into confessing, and she agrees. Conflicted, but desiring to live, John agrees to confess, and the officers of the court rejoice. But he refuses to incriminate anyone else, and when the court insists that the confession must be made public, Proctor grows angry, tears it up, and retracts his admission of guilt. Despite Hale’s desperate pleas, Proctor goes to the gallows with the others, and the witch trials reach their awful conclusion."
Science,"In 1951, an African American woman named Henrietta Lacks discovered what she called a “knot” on her cervix that turned out to be a particularly virulent form of cervical cancer. The head of gynecology at Johns Hopkins Hospital, who was studying cervical cancer at the time, had asked the head of tissue culture, George Gey, to develop a culture of both healthy and cancerous surgical cell tissue. As a result, Gey asked for tissue samples from all cervical cancer patients, including Henrietta Lacks. At the time, no human cells had ever survived long in a laboratory, but Henrietta’s cancer cells, which Gey labeled as HeLa, survived. Meanwhile, Henrietta underwent treatment for her cervical cancer but succumbed to the disease, leaving behind her five children and husband. The Lacks family had no idea that doctors had taken her cells or that some of her cells were still alive. When the doctors at Hopkins requested an autopsy, Henrietta’s husband Day hesitated, but relented at his cousin’s insistence when a doctor suggested that the information gleaned from the autopsy could someday help his children. It wasn’t until 1973, when a family friend who was a researcher mentioned that he did work on HeLa cells, that the family learned a part of Henrietta was still alive.
Gey’s culture of HeLa cells not only survived, but allowed scientists to conduct unprecedented research on disease and genetics, as well as develop new medical treatments and vaccines. At no charge, Gey gave samples of HeLa cells to any researcher who requested them. Over time, for-profit cell culture labs sprung up, mass-producing HeLa cells and other cell lines in order to more efficiently supply research labs. However, because HeLa cells were so hearty and grew so quickly, they had the potential to contaminate other cell cultures. In 1973, geneticists realized that if they could identify distinct genetic markers within HeLa cells, they could more easily identify which cultures had been contaminated. To that end, a geneticist at Hopkins asked Henrietta’s children to have blood samples taken. The doctors didn’t make sure that the Lacks children understood why they needed to have blood drawn, and Deborah, Henrietta’s daughter, believed that they were giving her a cancer screening.
 Meanwhile, because HeLa cells and cell culturing promised so many advances in medicine, the media spread the story of the “immortal” cell culture and the mysterious woman behind the cells. Although a colleague of Gey’s published Henrietta’s real name in a small niche journal, most mainstream news outlets mistakenly gave her name as Helen Lane. In 1975, a journalist from Rolling Stone named Michael Rogers discovered Henrietta’s true name and contacted the Lacks family for an article about HeLa cells. The Lacks family was horrified to learn that other people were profiting from Henrietta’s cells. The experience reminded them of the terrible history of white doctors in the US conducting unethical research on black patients. Journalists continued to approach the family, including a BBC documentary team in 1996. Deborah hoped the documentary would bring Henrietta’s story to light and help Deborah learn more about her mother. Unfortunately, the documentary also attracted Sir Lord Cofield, a conman, to the family. Posing as a lawyer, Cofield claimed he could help the family sue Hopkins Hospital. When the family discovered his scam, he threatened legal action against the family, terrifying them. The stress from the ordeal gave Deborah a stroke.
		
In 1999, Rebecca Skloot, the author of this book, attempted to make contact with the Lacks family as she began her research. Because of the history of white journalists contacting the family for stories without offering transparency or proper compensation, in addition to the very recent ordeal with Cofield, the family initially didn’t want to speak with her. However, Skloot kept trying to make contact and spoke with several cousins in the Lacks family. Because she knew that Deborah wanted to know more about who her mother was as a person, Skloot left messages on Deborah’s phone sharing what she learned about Henrietta’s childhood. Finally, Sonny and Deborah Lacks agreed to speak with her. Deborah made Skloot promise to share all of her research and help her understand what happened to her mother. She also wanted to find out what happened to her sister, Elsie, who had been placed in a mental institution before Deborah was born. Skloot agreed, and Deborah regularly accompanied Skloot on her research trips.
In 2001, a researcher at Johns Hopkins invited the Lacks family to his lab. Accompanied by Skloot, Deborah and Deborah’s brother, Zakariyya, finally got to see where Hopkins kept their mother’s cells, and even watched HeLa cells divide under a microscope in real time. Later that week, Skloot and Deborah went to the hospital where Elsie had been institutionalized, and discovered that she’d been subjected to horrific abuse. Deborah’s blood pressure spiked from the stress of everything she had learned that weekend, and she began to behave erratically. Her cousin, Gary, performed a religious soul cleansing ceremony on her in which he lifted the burden of the cells from Deborah’s shoulders. To Skloot’s surprise, Gary proclaimed that from now on Skloot would help carry the burden for Deborah. Deborah decided that she wanted to learn more about science in order to better understand what happened to her mother, but didn’t have the money to pursue adult education. Instead, she focused her efforts on her grandchildren and her siblings’ grandchildren, and encouraged them to go to school. Skloot remained in contact with Deborah as she wrote the book and promised to share the final manuscript before it went to press. Sadly, Deborah died in 2009, right as Skloot made final touches on the book before publication."
Folks,"In this book, originally published in 1903, W. E. B. Du Bois has collected fourteen of his own essays about life after the Civil War, especially in the South. While the book predominantly deals with Black society and the life of “freedmen,” it also discusses how white society evolved after Emancipation. Throughout the text, Du Bois presents specific examples of racial injustice and inequality in the South. Before each essay, Du Bois includes a poem (or an excerpt from a poem or song) appropriate to the essay’s subject matter. Every inclusion is “a bar of the Sorrow Songs,—some echo of haunting melody from the only American music which welled up from the black souls in the dark past.” Du Bois revisits the significance of these inclusions at the end of the book.
While each essay examines a particular piece of the evolution of Black society, they are arranged to give the reader a historical perspective. Chapter I and Chapter II deal with the history and immediate impact of Emancipation, using historical examples and Du Bois’s own experience. Chapter III. specifically discusses the formation and responsibility of Black leadership, while criticizing Booker T. Washington on an academic level. Du Bois goes on to describe the Atlanta Compromise and the limitations it has placed on Black society in the South. Chapter IV through Chapter VII discuss the need for progress, and how it is blocked by lack of education and opportunity. He stresses that current systems produce mostly laborers, and that there is little room for Black upward mobility, especially in the South, due to a lack of education (and college-educated individuals). In Chapter VIII and Chapter IX, Du Bois describes visiting Dougherty County in rural Georgia. His first-hand experiences there are contrasted with his upbringing in New England, to show not only that there is greater disparity in the South, but also that many Black people in the South are not fully aware of it. In Chapter VI and Chapter VII, Du Bois draws on analogies to mythology to better explain the challenges he sees in the upbringing of Black men. In Chapter X., Du Bois examines the religion of the Black South. 
Chapters XI, XII, and XIII offer narrative examples of individuals Du Bois has encountered and events from Du Bois’s own life to illustrate the disparity between white and Black society. He discusses the death of his young son, pays tribute to a world-traveling preacher who remained undiscouraged, and recalls a student who had great potential but was a victim of his circumstances. Du Bois admits that these men are not well-known to history, but he considers their experiences are worthy of study. The final chapter, Chapter XIV, has several selections of “Sorrow Songs” that Du Bois describes as the “spiritual heritage of the nation.” He describes how the songs have been handed down, many from before slavery, and how they have become interconnected with religion and are still a centerpiece in Black society. 
Throughout the work, Du Bois uses historical fact and narrative example to establish how slavery and its aftereffects have shaped both Black and white society in the South. As a teacher, he then examines each situation academically. He presents cause and effect relationships and applies sociological analysis to them. The largest problem Du Bois discusses is the shortage of resources and opportunity for Black people at the beginning of the 20th century. He points out the effects of disparities in education and privilege and demonstrates the need for change."
Senate,"Alex Claremont-Diaz is the 21-year-old son of Ellen Claremont, the first female president of the United States. Alex is highly ambitious, with his sights set on a career in politics like his mother and his father, who is a US senator. Alex is finishing his last year of college and living in the White House with his family, including his older sister June. As the novel opens, June and Alex discuss the British royal wedding, which they are about to attend, and Alex talks about how much he hates the groom’s younger brother, Prince Henry. When Alex was 12, he used to look repeatedly at a photo of Henry from one of June’s teen magazines. But when he met Henry in person, Henry was rude to him, and he’s disliked Henry ever since. At the wedding, Alex is focused on Prince Henry and is irritated by everything he does, especially when he asks June to dance for a photo opportunity. Drunk, Alex confronts Henry for acting superior, and the two end up in a physical altercation that topples the $75,000 royal wedding cake. The international incident is a scandal, and Alex is forced to pretend to be Henry’s close friend to squash rumors of a shaky relationship between the United States and Britain. 
Alex has no choice but to go along with the plan. As Alex and Henry spend more time together, however, Alex is continually surprised by Henry and finds that Henry is not at all what he expected. He’s especially moved when he sees Henry speaking warmly and openly to a young girl with cancer. Before Alex can talk to Henry about it, there’s a loud noise like gunshots, and the two are rushed into a supply closet by security. In the closet, Henry ends up apologizing for mistreating Alex in the past and says he was cold to Alex because his father had just died. Alex and Henry exchange phone numbers and start texting and talking on the phone. The Claremont-Diaz clan has a family dinner, and Ellen offers both Alex and June positions in her reelection campaign. Alex is thrilled, but June, who wants to be a journalist, declines the offer. 
Alex, June, and their best friend Nora, who is the granddaughter of the Vice President, throw their annual New Year’s Eve party. Henry attends with his best friend Pez, who is enamored of June. Everyone is having fun together, but when Henry sees Alex and Nora kiss at midnight, he gets jealous and leaves the party. Alex finds him in the garden, and Henry kisses him for the first time. This spurs a crisis of sexual identity in Alex, who can’t stop thinking about the kiss. Though Alex has had a sexual relationship with his high school friend Liam and been attracted to men, he’s never considered himself bisexual. He talks to Nora about his confusion, and she says that Henry is gay, and that Alex seems to have feelings for Henry. When Henry flies in for a dinner, Alex kisses him while a security guard keeps watch. That night, they have sex for the first time, and Alex says they are friends with benefits. Henry and Alex continue to meet up to have sex when they can get away. They also begin to write flirtatious emails to each other and have heart-to-hearts on the phone. After a night on the town with June, Nora, Henry, Pez, and Henry’s sister Bea, Alex begins to develop feelings for Henry. 
Since Alex's mother is running for reelection and because Henry is a royal, it’s crucial that Henry and Alex’s relationship remain a secret. Alex often turns to his mentor and family friend, Senator Rafael Luna, for advice to help his mother with her campaign. It’s a blow to the whole family when Luna comes out as the running mate for Ellen’s opponent, Jeffrey Richards. Alex is devastated, and Henry comes to visit Alex at the Democratic National Convention to comfort him. The next morning, Zahra, Ellen’s chief of staff and family friend, catches Henry and Alex together and agrees to keep it a secret until after the convention. Alex comes out to his mother, who creates a PowerPoint presentation as a means of talking about the dangers of his relationship with Henry. She tells him she’ll support him, but he needs to be sure the relationship is forever. He goes to his family’s lake house with Henry, June, Nora, and his father Oscar. Alex comes out to his father, too, and he realizes that he is in love with Henry. Just as he’s about to tell Henry how he feels, Henry suddenly becomes formal and fake and leaves the conversation. The next morning Henry leaves the lake house without saying goodbye, leaving only a note. 
When Henry stops responding to Alex’s texts, Alex is distraught. He flies to London to confront Henry. Henry says he can’t be in a relationship with Alex because of the royal family. They have sex, and neither of them is sure whether it is a goodbye or the beginning of their relationship. Henry gives Alex his signet ring and says he wants to be with Alex. They are happy to be together, and they send each other passionate emails when they are apart.
Suspicions about their relationship start coming out in the press, so Alex and Henry pretend to go on dates with Nora and June. It’s painful for Henry to pretend to be someone he isn’t. Then, Akex and Henry's relationship is leaked to the press, with photos of them together and their entire email history. They are both forced to go on a communication blackout, and Ellen’s team attempts to triage the situation. Alex is miserable and worried about Henry. Eventually, he flies to London. Alex and Bea help Henry confront his family, including his grandmother, the Queen. As the Queen argues that the world will never accept them, a group of people gathers outside the palace to express support for Alex and Henry’s love.  
Nora, who has been missing since the news of Alex and Henry’s relationship broke, emerges and reveals that it was the Richards campaign that leaked their photographs and emails. Alex figures out that it was Luna who tipped them off. Alex talks to Luna, and Luna reveals that Richards sexually assaulted him when he was his intern. Luna joined the campaign to expose Richards as a sexual predator. Election night is tense, and in the end, whoever wins Texas, Ellen’s home state, will win the election. Ellen wins, and Henry joins Alex onstage for her victory lap. The two leave the party and go to Alex’s house. Alex shows Henry where he grew up, letting them in with the key he always wears around his neck."
Addresses,"The Bottom is a mostly Black community in Ohio, situated in the hills above the mostly white, wealthier community of Medallion. The Bottom first became a community when a master gave it to his former slave. This ""gift"" was in fact a trick: the master gave the former slave a poor stretch of hilly land, convincing the slave the land was worthwhile by claiming that because it was hilly, it was closer to heaven. The trick, though, led to the growth of a vibrant community. Now the community faces a new threat; wealthy whites have taken a liking to the land, and would like to destroy much of the town in order to build a golf course.
Shadrack, a resident of the Bottom, fought in WWI. He returns a shattered man, unable to accept the complexities of the world; he lives on the outskirts of town, attempting to create order in his life. One of his methods involves compartmentalizing his fear of death in a ritual he invents and names National Suicide Day. The town is at first wary of him and his ritual, then, over time, unthinkingly accepts him.
Meanwhile, the families of the children Nel and Sula are contrasted. Nel is the product of a family that believes deeply in social conventions; hers is a stable home, though some might characterize it as rigid. Nel is uncertain of the conventional life her mother, Helene, wants for her; these doubts are hammered home when she meets Rochelle, her grandmother and a former prostitute, the only unconventional woman in her family line. Sula's family is very different: she lives with her grandmother, Eva, and her mother, Hannah, both of whom are seen by the town as eccentric and loose. Their house also serves as a home for three informally adopted boys and a steady stream of borders.
Despite their differences, Sula and Nel become fiercely attached to each other during adolescence. However, a traumatic accident changes everything. One day, Sula playfully swings a neighborhood boy, Chicken Little, around by his hands. When she loses her grip, the boy falls into a nearby river and drowns. They never tell anyone about the accident even though they did not intend to harm the boy. The two girls begin to grow apart. One day, in an accident, Sula's mother's dress catches fire and she dies of the burns.
After high school, Nel chooses to marry and settles into the conventional role of wife and mother. Sula follows a wildly divergent path and lives a life of fierce independence and total disregard for social conventions. Shortly after Nel's wedding, Sula leaves the Bottom for a period of 10 years. She has many affairs, some with white men. However, she finds people following the same boring routines elsewhere, so she returns to the Bottom and to Nel.
Upon her return, the town regards Sula as the very personification of evil for her blatant disregard of social conventions. Their hatred in part rests upon Sula's interracial relationships, but is crystallized when Sula has an affair with Nel's husband, Jude, who subsequently abandons Nel. Ironically, the community's labeling of Sula as evil actually improves their own lives. Her presence in the community gives them the impetus to live harmoniously with one another. Nel breaks off her friendship with Sula. Just before Sula dies in 1940, they achieve a half-hearted reconciliation. With Sula's death, the harmony that had reigned in the town quickly dissolves.
In 1965, with the Bottom facing the prospect of the white golf course, Nel visits Eva in the nursing home. Eva accuses her of sharing the guilt for Chicken Little's death. Her accusation forces Nel to confront the unfairness of her judgment against Sula. Nel admits to herself that she had blamed his death entirely on Sula and set herself up as the ""good"" half of the relationship. Nel comes to realize that in the aftermath of Chicken Little's death she had too quickly clung to social convention in an effort to define herself as ""good."" Nel goes to the cemetery and mourns at Sula's grave, calling out Sula's name in sadness.
Sula is a novel about ambiguity. It questions and examines the terms ""good"" and ""evil,"" often demonstrating that the two often resemble one another. The novel addresses the confusing mysteries of human emotions and relationships, ultimately concluding that social conventions are inadequate as a foundation for living one's life. The novel tempts the reader to apply the diametrically opposed terms of ""good and evil,"" ""right and wrong"" to the characters and their actions, and yet simultaneously shows why it is necessary to resist such temptation. While exploring the ways in which people try to make meaning of lives filled with conflicts over race, gender, and simple idiosyncratic points of views, Sula resists easy answers, demonstrating the ambiguity, beauty, and terror of life, in both its triumphs and horrors."
Physicists,"In Part I of The Elegant Universe, “The Edge of Knowledge,” Greene introduces the central problem of modern physics: the incompatibility of Einstein’s theory of general relativity with quantum mechanics. He then lists the physical curiosities—properties of the motion of light, gravity, and the behavior of particles at the subatomic level—that have prevented physicists from establishing a single coherent theory for how the universe works. For most of the twentieth century, physicists contented themselves with describing either the most small-scale or the most large-scale workings of the cosmos, but never both simultaneously. At the end of this section, Greene describes both the objectives and the promise of superstring theory, which attempts to merge the laws of general relativity with those of quantum mechanics.
Without dismissing the importance of electrons and quarks, which are the basis of quantum mechanics, superstring theory depicts the smallest particles in the universe not as dots but as tiny strings of energy. These strings are one hundred billion billion (a quintillion) times smaller than a single atomic nucleus. They vibrate in different patterns, which in turn produce different particle properties. But because these strings are too tiny to locate with current scientific tools, superstring theory is not yet predictable or testable. Therefore, physicists like Greene must work with approximations of equations until more information has been verified. Still, the promise of string theory is tremendous. Only string theory’s conceptual framework offers any possibility of unifying general relativity and quantum mechanics into one complete understanding of how the universe works.
In Part II, “The Dilemma of Space, Time, and the Quanta,” Greene reviews the basic precepts of the two competing theories—first, Einstein’s special and general relativity, and then the “microscopic weirdness” of quantum mechanics. General relativity presupposes a smooth surface of space, but at an ultramicroscopic level (which quantum mechanics has helped unveil), the spatial fabric is subject to violent undulations known as “quantum foam.” Greene also discusses the basic principle of quantum mechanics: the uncertainty principle. The uncertainty principle predicts the impossibility of knowing both the exact location and the velocity of a particle at any given time. Greene goes over the four fundamental forces—the strong force, the weak force, electromagnetism, and gravity—and he describes the complexity of incorporating gravity into the standard model of the first three. In the last chapter of this section, Greene stresses the necessity of finding a new theory that revises both general relativity and quantum mechanics. Like many of his colleagues, Greene simply cannot accept that the universe is, at its core, divided into two contradictory theoretical frameworks.
In Part III, “The Cosmic Symphony,” Greene discusses in detail how superstring theory works. He employs many musical metaphors to suggest how strings “harmonize” or bring together the most puzzling aspects of the cosmos. After praising the elegance and economy of the theory, Greene gives a brief history of its first incarnation in the 1970s, when it was referred to as the bosonic string theory. He also explains the subsequent revisions the theory underwent during the first superstring revolution in 1984. Greene then describes how supersymmetry— a concept that predicts the existence of superpartners that correspond with all known particles—transformed string theory into superstring theory.
With these basics covered, Greene proceeds to one of the oddest claims of string theory: the theory that the universe contains far more dimensions than we can perceive. In its current form, superstring theory postulates the existence of eleven total dimensions: ten of space and one of time. According to the theory, equations of quantum theory can mesh beautifully with relativity if we assume the existence of eleven dimensions. Greene concludes “The Cosmic Symphony” by analyzing the central difficulty of string theory—namely, the lack of experimental evidence for superstring theory. He describes the efforts he and his colleagues have made to develop string theory and refine its underlying mathematical principles. He shows what a Calabi-Yau space (the six-dimensional shape that physicists believe the additional, curled-up dimensions of space will form) may look like.
Part IV, “String Theory and the Fabric of Spacetime,” is the most complicated and involved section of the book. Greene begins with an overview of quantum geometry and the new kind of math that must emerge to explain the universe on an ultramicroscopic scale. He argues that contrary to what physicists previously believed, the fabric of space can be ripped and torn with no catastrophic consequences. He also covers the second superstring revolution, which shows that all five string theories are really part of a single, unified framework called M-theory. It is fitting that no one knows what the “M” signifies, because M-theory is one of the most radical, incompletely understood theories ever to evolve. M-theory proposes the unification of gravity with the three nongravitational forces. It is an extension of string theory that suggests the elementary particles of the universe might include, in addition to strings, two-dimensional membranes and three-dimensional blobs of varying size. Greene ends his discussion of the latest advances in superstring theory by discussing its cosmological implications, what it might reveal about the origins of the universe.
Part V, “Unification in the Twenty-First Century,” concludes the book. It covers the prospects of string theory in the twenty-first century. It describes the advances Greene and other string theorists hope to make in unveiling a single theory to explain the entire universe. For all his optimistic predictions, however, Greene never hesitates to admit that because of its complexity, superstring theory might not be fully understood for many years."
Escape,"Refugee follows the stories of three different children and their families, each attempting to flee their violent homelands, in different regions of the world and during different decades. Josef and his family flee Nazi Germany in 1938; Isabel and her family flee Cuba in 1994; and Mahmoud and his family flee Syria in 2015.
Josef Landau is a twelve-year-old boy living in Berlin. In 1938, his home is raided by Nazi storm troopers, and his father is taken to the Dachau concentration camp. Six months later, his mother receives a telegram that her husband has been released, but the family must leave Germany immediately. Josef, his sister Ruth, and his mother all travel to Hamburg to board a ship that will take them to Cuba. When Josef’s father is reunited with his family, they notice that Dachau has changed him: he is paranoid and very thin. They board the St. Louis, a large German ship, and set out.
Aboard the St. Louis, Josef’s family and the other passengers, all Jewish refugees, are treated well by Captain Schroeder and most of the ship’s crew. A few of the crew, however, openly dislike the Jewish passengers, especially Otto Schiendick, who proudly states his Nazi allegiance. When the St. Louis reaches Havana Harbor in Cuba, the ship is not allowed to dock. Josef’s father’s mental state deteriorates further, and he eventually jumps from the ship, trying to kill himself. Officer Padron, a Cuban policeman assigned to the St. Louis, saves Josef’s father. Josef’s father is taken to Havana to recover. When Officer Padron returns to the St. Louis, he is treated like a hero by the Jewish passengers. 
Eventually, the captain announces that they are not going to be allowed to dock in Havana and that the boat will be leaving. He promises the passengers that he will try to deliver them to a country other than Germany. The refugees aboard the St. Louis are delivered to England, Belgium, the Netherlands, and France. The Nazis invade France just a few months after Josef’s family arrives there. When the family is eventually caught, Josef’s mother is forced to choose which of her children will be freed and which will be sent to a concentration camp.
Isabel Fernandez is an eleven-year-old girl who lives just outside Havana in 1994. After the fall of the Soviet Union, Cuba has become inhospitable for most of its citizens under the regime of Fidel Castro. Isabel’s best friend and neighbor, Iván, is building a small boat with his father so that his family can flee to America. After a riot in Havana, Isabel’s family decides that they should also leave Cuba immediately. Isabel trades her trumpet to a fisherman for gasoline, paying her family’s way onto Iván’s family’s boat. Lito, Isabel’s grandfather, also joins them. 
The two families face many challenges as they try to cross the Caribbean Sea to Florida. A storm sweeps them to the Bahamas, where they are not allowed to disembark; Iván is attacked by sharks and eventually bleeds to death in the boat; and toward the end of the journey, Isabel’s pregnant mother goes into labor. Lito tells the story of the St. Louis and how he had to turn away so many refugees when he was a young policeman. (He is Officer Padron from Josef’s story.) Just when Miami becomes visible on the horizon, a U.S. Coast Guard boat tries to intercept the two families. Lito jumps in the water to distract the Coast Guard, and Isabel’s mother gives birth to a boy, just as they reach the shore. When Isabel is asked to play a song at her new school in America, she plays a Cuban salsa version of “The Star-Spangled Banner.”
Mahmoud Bishara is a twelve-year-old boy who lives in Aleppo, Syria in 2015. For the last few years, there has been a war in his country between the Syrian government, rebels, the Soviets, the United States and several other factions. After Mahmoud’s home is destroyed, his brother Waleed, sister Hana, and his parents drive to the border of Turkey, hoping to escape. Mahmoud’s father tells them that Germany is accepting Syrian refugees and if they can get to Greece, they will be able to travel within the European Union to reach Germany. After a violent conflict between the rebels and the Syrian government, Mahmoud and his family walk to the Turkish border. Mahmoud’s father arranges for a smuggler to take them to the island of Lesbos, in Greece. The smuggler’s raft is destroyed by rocks as they cross the Mediterranean. Mahmoud hands his sister, Hana, to another passing raft of refugees, knowing that his mother cannot hold her and swim. The family is eventually pulled from the water by the Greek Coast Guard. 
Mahmoud and his family travel through Serbia and into Hungary, where they are detained at a refugee camp that is built like a prison. Mahmoud decides that he no longer wants to be ignored and leads the refugees out of the prison, walking twelve hours to Austria. The refugees are welcomed in Austria, and Mahmoud’s family takes a train to Germany. While they travel, they ask if anyone has seen Hana. After a few weeks in Munich, Mahmoud’s family is transferred to a host family in Berlin. An elderly couple, Herr and Frau Rosenberg, welcome them into their home. Frau Rosenberg takes Mahmoud aside and tells him the story of her childhood: she is Ruth, Josef’s sister. The night that they were captured in France, Josef volunteered to be taken by the Nazis; both Josef and their mother were killed in concentration camps. Ruth promises to help Mahmoud find Hana."
Interfered,"Educated is primarily retrospective, consisting of Tara Westover's memories about her past. She tells the story of the events of her life from a vantage point in her late twenties, occasionally interjecting to comment on the process of trying to arrive at an accurate version of the past. Tara was born the youngest of seven children to parents whom she refers to as Faye and Gene (pseudonyms). The Westover family lived on a farm in rural Idaho, where Gene made a living salvaging scrap metal while Faye worked as an unlicensed midwife and herbal healer. Gene suffered from paranoid fears about interference from the federal government, and as a result he refused to allow his children to attend school, receive birth certificates, or receive medical attention. Gene was also a devout Mormon who believed in radical self-sufficiency and an impending Day of Judgement.
		
Shifts in the Westover family dynamic began to emerge when Tara was about nine. Her mother's work as a midwife increased her sense of independence, but after sustaining a serious and untreated brain injury in a car accident, Faye began to lose confidence in her skills, and focused instead on using herbal remedies and a form of intuitive healing. Around this time, Tyler (the third son) announced that he was going to attend college, which estranged him from his family. Tyler's absence forced Tara to become more involved in helping her father with his scrapping work, which left her constantly exposed to the possibility of dangerous injury. It also made her more curious about possibly pursuing an education herself. When Tara was ten, she told her disapproving father that she wanted to begin going to school, but nothing came of the idea.
As Tara grew into her teens, she acquired more independence from her family due to taking on various jobs and pursuing singing and musical theatre in the local community. However, her life was dominated by the strict rules and religious doctrine her father imposed, and Tara often worried about becoming sinful. When Tara was thirteen, her older brother Shawn moved back home. At first Shawn and Tara were close and spent a lot of time together. When Tara was about fifteen, however, Shawn began to be physically abusive toward her. His behavior only got worse after Shawn experienced a head injury. Tyler eventually realized that Shawn was hurting Tara, and he urged Tara to seriously consider applying to college and getting away from the family. Although she was uncertain at first, Tara began to study and was eventually accepted at Brigham Young University, having passed herself off as homeschooled.
In January 2004, when Tara was seventeen years old, she moved to Utah to begin her college education. She found the adjustment very difficult at first, but eventually began to excel in her studies. Tara's finances were precarious, and she had to hold multiple jobs and maintain very high grades to retain her scholarship. Her emerging independence also caused a threatening dynamic between her, Gene, and Shawn. Whenever Tara returned to Buck's Peak, her father manipulated her into working for him, while Shawn continued to physically and emotionally abuse her. Tara eventually confided to a bishop about her life, and he helped her to secure funding to finance her education. Tara's studies, and the people she met, also gradually opened her eyes to different realities and force her to realize how damaging and isolating her childhood has been. Tara eventually changed her major to studying history, and is encouraged to apply for a study abroad program at Cambridge University in England.
Tara's experience at Cambridge broadened her horizons even further, and she was encouraged to consider graduate studies. Tara still felt isolated from her peers, and ashamed of her origins. She hid most of her past even from her friends and the men she occasionally dated. She was eventually awarded a prestigious Cambridge Gates Fellowship and moved to England to pursue a Master's degree. She remained in close contact with her family and returned to Idaho regularly to visit, but her relationship with them deteriorated. Shawn was growing increasingly erratic and violent, and Tara feared for the safety of his wife and young child. By chance, she revealed to her sister Audrey that Shawn had been abusive with her, and Audrey later confided that Shawn abused her as well. Audrey blamed herself for not protecting her younger sister, and suggested that she and Tara confront their parents and Shawn about what happened to them.
By then Tara had built a happy life for herself in England, and was working on a PhD in history at Cambridge. However, the attempt to speak the truth quickly became a source of conflict in the family. Tara became more and more ostracized within her family, eventually culminating in Shawn learning that she had been telling their parents about the abuse she suffered. Realizing her family would never trust her claims, Tara became estranged from most of them, with the exception of Tyler.  The estrangement from her family prompted grief and depression for Tara, but she was finally able to heal, and successfully completed her PhD. By the end of her memoir, Tara has accepted that she may never have a relationship with her family again, but she takes pride in the independence she has established, and the life she has built for herself."
Mental,"The Catcher in the Rye is set around the 1950s and is narrated by a young man named Holden Caulfield. Holden is not specific about his location while he’s telling the story, but he makes it clear that he is undergoing treatment in a mental hospital or sanatorium. The events he narrates take place in the few days between the end of the fall school term and Christmas, when Holden is sixteen years old.
Holden’s story begins on the Saturday following the end of classes at the Pencey prep school in Agerstown, Pennsylvania. Pencey is Holden’s fourth school; he has already failed out of three others. At Pencey, he has failed four out of five of his classes and has received notice that he is being expelled, but he is not scheduled to return home to Manhattan until Wednesday. He visits his elderly history teacher, Spencer, to say goodbye, but when Spencer tries to reprimand him for his poor academic performance, Holden becomes annoyed.
Back in the dormitory, Holden is further irritated by his unhygienic neighbor, Ackley, and by his own roommate, Stradlater. Stradlater spends the evening on a date with Jane Gallagher, a girl whom Holden used to date and whom he still admires. During the course of the evening, Holden grows increasingly nervous about Stradlater’s taking Jane out, and when Stradlater returns, Holden questions him insistently about whether he tried to have sex with her. Stradlater teases Holden, who flies into a rage and attacks Stradlater. Stradlater pins Holden down and bloodies his nose. Holden decides that he’s had enough of Pencey and will go to Manhattan three days early, stay in a hotel, and not tell his parents that he is back.
On the train to New York, Holden meets the mother of one of his fellow Pencey students. Though he thinks this student is a complete “bastard,” he tells the woman made-up stories about how shy her son is and how well respected he is at school. When he arrives at Penn Station, he goes into a phone booth and considers calling several people, but for various reasons he decides against it. He gets in a cab and asks the cab driver where the ducks in Central Park go when the lagoon freezes, but his question annoys the driver. Holden has the cab driver take him to the Edmont Hotel, where he checks himself in.
From his room at the Edmont, Holden can see into the rooms of some of the guests in the opposite wing. He observes a man putting on silk stockings, high heels, a bra, a corset, and an evening gown. He also sees a man and a woman in another room taking turns spitting mouthfuls of their drinks into each other’s faces and laughing hysterically. He interprets the couple’s behavior as a form of sexual play and is both upset and aroused by it. After smoking a couple of cigarettes, he calls Faith Cavendish, a woman he has never met but whose number he got from an acquaintance at Princeton. Holden thinks he remembers hearing that she used to be a stripper, and he believes he can persuade her to have sex with him. He calls her, and though she is at first annoyed to be called at such a late hour by a complete stranger, she eventually suggests that they meet the next day. Holden doesn’t want to wait that long and winds up hanging up without arranging a meeting.
Holden goes downstairs to the Lavender Room and sits at a table, but the waiter realizes he’s a minor and refuses to serve him. He flirts with three women in their thirties, who seem like they’re from out of town and are mostly interested in catching a glimpse of a celebrity. Nevertheless, Holden dances with them and feels that he is “half in love” with the blonde one after seeing how well she dances. After making some wisecracks about his age, they leave, letting him pay their entire tab.
As Holden goes out to the lobby, he starts to think about Jane Gallagher and, in a flashback, recounts how he got to know her. They met while spending a summer vacation in Maine, played golf and checkers, and held hands at the movies. One afternoon, during a game of checkers, her stepfather came onto the porch where they were playing, and when he left Jane began to cry. Holden had moved to sit beside her and kissed her all over her face, but she wouldn’t let him kiss her on the mouth. That was the closest they came to “necking.”
Holden leaves the Edmont and takes a cab to Ernie’s jazz club in Greenwich Village. Again, he asks the cab driver where the ducks in Central Park go in the winter, and this cabbie is even more irritable than the first one. Holden sits alone at a table in Ernie’s and observes the other patrons with distaste. He runs into Lillian Simmons, one of his older brother’s former girlfriends, who invites him to sit with her and her date. Holden says he has to meet someone, leaves, and walks back to the Edmont.
Maurice, the elevator operator at the Edmont, offers to send a prostitute to Holden’s room for five dollars, and Holden agrees. A young woman, identifying herself as “Sunny,” arrives at his door. She pulls off her dress, but Holden starts to feel “peculiar” and tries to make conversation with her. He claims that he recently underwent a spinal operation and isn’t sufficiently recovered to have sex with her, but he offers to pay her anyway. She sits on his lap and talks dirty to him, but he insists on paying her five dollars and showing her the door. Sunny returns with Maurice, who demands another five dollars from Holden. When Holden refuses to pay, Maurice punches him in the stomach and leaves him on the floor, while Sunny takes five dollars from his wallet. Holden goes to bed.
He wakes up at ten o’clock on Sunday and calls Sally Hayes, an attractive girl whom he has dated in the past. They arrange to meet for a matinee showing of a Broadway play. He eats breakfast at a sandwich bar, where he converses with two nuns about Romeo and Juliet. He gives the nuns ten dollars. He tries to telephone Jane Gallagher, but her mother answers the phone, and he hangs up. He takes a cab to Central Park to look for his younger sister, Phoebe, but she isn’t there. He helps one of Phoebe’s schoolmates tighten her skate, and the girl tells him that Phoebe might be in the Museum of Natural History. Though he knows that Phoebe’s class wouldn’t be at the museum on a Sunday, he goes there anyway, but when he gets there he decides not to go in and instead takes a cab to the Biltmore Hotel to meet Sally.
Holden and Sally go to the play, and Holden is annoyed that Sally talks with a boy she knows from Andover afterward. At Sally’s suggestion, they go to Radio City to ice skate. They both skate poorly and decide to get a table instead. Holden tries to explain to Sally why he is unhappy at school, and actually urges her to run away with him to Massachusetts or Vermont and live in a cabin. When she refuses, he calls her a “pain in the ass” and laughs at her when she reacts angrily. She refuses to listen to his apologies and leaves.
Holden calls Jane again, but there is no answer. He calls Carl Luce, a young man who had been Holden’s student advisor at the Whooton School and who is now a student at Columbia University. Luce arranges to meet him for a drink after dinner, and Holden goes to a movie at Radio City to kill time. Holden and Luce meet at the Wicker Bar in the Seton Hotel. At Whooton, Luce had spoken frankly with some of the boys about sex, and Holden tries to draw him into a conversation about it once more. Luce grows irritated by Holden’s juvenile remarks about gay men and about Luce’s Chinese girlfriend, and he makes an excuse to leave early. Holden continues to drink Scotch and listen to the pianist and singer.
Quite drunk, Holden telephones Sally Hayes and babbles about their Christmas Eve plans. Then he goes to the lagoon in Central Park, where he used to watch the ducks as a child. It takes him a long time to find it, and by the time he does, he is freezing cold. He then decides to sneak into his own apartment building and wake his sister, Phoebe. He is forced to admit to Phoebe that he was kicked out of school, which makes her mad at him. When he tries to explain why he hates school, she accuses him of not liking anything. He tells her his fantasy of being “the catcher in the rye,” a person who catches little children as they are about to fall off of a cliff. Phoebe tells him that he has misremembered the poem that he took the image from: Robert Burns’s poem says “if a body meet a body, coming through the rye,” not “catch a body.”
Holden calls his former English teacher, Mr. Antolini, who tells Holden he can come to his apartment. Mr. Antolini asks Holden about his expulsion and tries to counsel him about his future. Holden can’t hide his sleepiness, and Mr. Antolini puts him to bed on the couch. Holden awakens to find Mr. Antolini stroking his forehead. Thinking that Mr. Antolini is making a sexual overture, Holden hastily excuses himself and leaves, sleeping for a few hours on a bench at Grand Central Station.
Holden goes to Phoebe’s school and sends her a note saying that he is leaving home for good and that she should meet him at lunchtime at the museum. When Phoebe arrives, she is carrying a suitcase full of clothes, and she asks Holden to take her with him. He refuses angrily, and she cries and then refuses to speak to him. Knowing she will follow him, he walks to the zoo, and then takes her across the park to a carousel. He buys her a ticket and watches her ride it. It starts to rain heavily, but Holden is so happy watching his sister ride the carousel that he is close to tears.
Holden ends his narrative here, telling the reader that he is not going to tell the story of how he went home and got “sick.” He plans to go to a new school in the fall and is cautiously optimistic about his future."
Confuse,"Guy Montag is a fireman who burns books in a futuristic American city. In Montag’s world, firemen start fires rather than putting them out. The people in this society do not read books, enjoy nature, spend time by themselves, think independently, or have meaningful conversations. Instead, they drive very fast, watch excessive amounts of television on wall-size sets, and listen to the radio on “Seashell Radio” sets attached to their ears.
Montag encounters a gentle seventeen-year-old girl named Clarisse McClellan, who opens his eyes to the emptiness of his life with her innocently penetrating questions and her unusual love of people and nature. Over the next few days, Montag experiences a series of disturbing events. First, his wife, Mildred, attempts suicide by swallowing a bottle of sleeping pills. Then, when he responds to an alarm that an old woman has a stash of hidden literature, the woman shocks him by choosing to be burned alive along with her books. A few days later, he hears that Clarisse has been killed by a speeding car. Montag’s dissatisfaction with his life increases, and he begins to search for a solution in a stash of books that he has stolen from his own fires and hidden inside an air-conditioning vent.
When Montag fails to show up for work, his fire chief, Beatty, pays a visit to his house. Beatty explains that it’s normal for a fireman to go through a phase of wondering what books have to offer, and he delivers a dizzying monologue explaining how books came to be banned in the first place. According to Beatty, special-interest groups and other “minorities” objected to books that offended them. Soon, books all began to look the same, as writers tried to avoid offending anybody. This was not enough, however, and society as a whole decided to simply burn books rather than permit conflicting opinions. Beatty tells Montag to take twenty-four hours or so to see if his stolen books contain anything worthwhile and then turn them in for incineration. Montag begins a long and frenzied night of reading.
Overwhelmed by the task of reading, Montag looks to his wife for help and support, but she prefers television to her husband’s company and cannot understand why he would want to take the terrible risk of reading books. He remembers that he once met a retired English professor named Faber sitting in a park, and he decides that this man might be able to help him understand what he reads. He visits Faber, who tells him that the value of books lies in the detailed awareness of life that they contain. Faber says that Montag needs not only books but also the leisure to read them and the freedom to act upon their ideas.
Faber agrees to help Montag with his reading, and they concoct a risky scheme to overthrow the status quo. Faber will contact a printer and begin reproducing books, and Montag will plant books in the homes of firemen to discredit the profession and to destroy the machinery of censorship. Faber gives him a two-way radio earpiece (the “green bullet”) so that he can hear what Montag hears and talk to him secretly.
Montag goes home, and soon two of his wife’s friends arrive to watch television. The women discuss their families and the war that is about to be declared in an extremely frivolous manner. Their superficiality angers him, and he takes out a book of poetry and reads “Dover Beach” by Matthew Arnold. Faber buzzes in his ear for him to be quiet, and Mildred tries to explain that the poetry reading is a standard way for firemen to demonstrate the uselessness of literature. The women are extremely disturbed by the poem and leave to file a complaint against Montag.
Montag goes to the fire station and hands over one of his books to Beatty. Beatty confuses Montag by barraging him with contradictory quotations from great books. Beatty exploits these contradictions to show that literature is morbid and dangerously complex, and that it deserves incineration. Suddenly, the alarm sounds, and they rush off to answer the call, only to find that the alarm is at Montag’s own house. Mildred gets into a cab with her suitcase, and Montag realizes that his own wife has betrayed him.
Beatty forces Montag to burn the house himself; when he is done, Beatty places him under arrest. When Beatty continues to berate Montag, Montag turns the flamethrower on his superior and proceeds to burn him to ashes. Montag knocks the other firemen unconscious and runs. The Mechanical Hound, a monstrous machine that Beatty has set to attack Montag, pounces and injects Montag’s leg with a large dose of anesthetic. Montag manages to destroy it with his flamethrower; then he walks off the numbness in his leg and escapes with some books that were hidden in his backyard. He hides these in another fireman’s house and calls in an alarm from a pay phone.
Montag goes to Faber’s house, where he learns that a new Hound has been put on his trail, along with several helicopters and a television crew. Faber tells Montag that he is leaving for St. Louis to see a retired printer who may be able to help them. Montag gives Faber some money and tells him how to remove Montag’s scent from his house so the Hound will not enter it. Montag then takes some of Faber’s old clothes and runs off toward the river. The whole city watches as the chase unfolds on TV, but Montag manages to escape in the river and change into Faber’s clothes to disguise his scent. He drifts downstream into the country and follows a set of abandoned railroad tracks until he finds a group of renegade intellectuals (“the Book People”), led by a man named Granger, who welcome him. They are a part of a nationwide network of book lovers who have memorized many great works of literature and philosophy. They hope that they may be of some help to mankind in the aftermath of the war that has just been declared. Montag’s role is to memorize the Book of Ecclesiastes. Enemy jets appear in the sky and completely obliterate the city with bombs. Montag and his new friends move on to search for survivors and rebuild civilization."
Pile,"Katniss Everdeen wakes up on the day of the reaping, when the tributes are chosen who will take part in the Hunger Games. Her mother and little sister, Prim, sleep nearby. Her father died in a mine explosion years earlier. She goes hunting in the woods outside her district, District 12, with Gale, her best friend. That night, at the reaping ceremony, the mayor gives a speech describing how the governments of North America collapsed and the country of Panem rose up in their place. A war ensued between the Capitol and the districts. The Capitol won, and as a reminder of their defeat, the Capitol holds the Hunger Games every year. The mayor then introduces Haymitch Abernathy, District 12’s only living Hunger-Games winner, and he’s so drunk he ends up falling in his own vomit.
The district’s female tribute is chosen, and to Katniss’s horror, it’s Prim. Katniss volunteers immediately in Prim’s place. Then the male tribute is selected. It’s Peeta Mellark, and Katniss remembers how years earlier, while searching for food for her family in the garbage bins behind the town shops, Peeta gave her bread from his family’s bakery. Katniss credits him with saving her that day. Katniss and Peeta say goodbye to their friends and families and board a train for the Capitol. During the trip, she and Peeta convince Haymitch, their mentor in the Games and the person responsible for getting them gifts from sponsors, to take his duties seriously.
Once there, Katniss meets with her stylist, Cinna, who is designing her dress for the opening ceremony. At the ceremony, Katniss and Peeta wear simple black outfits lit with synthetic flames. The outfits are a huge hit with the audience and make Katniss and Peeta stand out among the tributes. The next day, Katniss and Peeta attend group training, and the tributes from rich districts who have trained for the Games their whole lives, called Career Tributes, show off their skills. Later, the tributes are interviewed by Caesar Flickerman, a television host. In his interview, Peeta reveals that he’s had a crush on Katniss for several years.
Finally the time comes. From a small underground room, Katniss is lifted into the arena and the Games officially begin. All the tributes are there, and in front of her is the Cornucopia, which houses an abundance of supplies. Rather than fight, she runs away as Haymitch advised. She hikes all day before making camp. After dark, someone starts a fire nearby, and it isn’t long before a pack of Career Tributes arrives and kills the person. To Katniss’s shock, Peeta is with them. The next day Katniss goes in search of water. She walks for hours and collapses from exhaustion, but ultimately she finds a stream. She’s woken in the night by a wall of fire moving in her direction, and as she runs away one of the numerous fireballs falling around her grazes her leg, injuring it.
That night, while she hides in a tree from the pack of Careers below, she notices a young girl named Rue from District 11 in a nearby tree. Rue points out a nest of tracker jackers, wasps engineered by the Capitol to be lethal, over Katniss’s head, and Katniss cuts the branch holding the nest, dropping it onto the Careers. Two of them die from the stings and the rest scatter. Katniss is stung a few times as well, but as she’s running away, she remembers one of the girls who died had a bow and arrows, the weapons she’s become proficient with from hunting. She runs back to retrieve them, and Peeta happens to arrive as she’s grabbing the bow. He yells at Katniss to run just as Cato, a very large and dangerous Career from District 2, shows up. Peeta stops him so Katniss can escape, and she passes out in a ditch shortly after.
Katniss encounters Rue again, and the two quickly form a bond. They are able to get food hunting and foraging, and Katniss realizes that the Careers would have difficulty surviving without the supplies at the Cornucopia, so she and Rue devise a plan. While Rue lights decoy fires, Katniss sneaks up to the Cornucopia. The supplies are in a pyramid away from the main camp, and after the Careers leave to investigate the fires, Katniss manages to blow up the supplies by cutting open a bag of apples with her arrows, which sets off the mines set to protect the pyramid. When Katniss doesn’t find Rue at their meeting spot, she goes looking for her and finds her just as another tribute stabs her with a spear. Katniss kills the other tribute, and when Rue dies, she covers her body in flowers.
Katniss is depressed all the next day, until an announcement is made that there has been a rule change: Now, two tributes from the same district can be declared winners. Katniss goes looking for Peeta, and it takes her a day but finally she finds him. He’s severely injured from his fight with Cato and can barely walk, but Katniss helps him to a cave where they’ll be hidden. Thinking Peeta may die, Katniss impulsively kisses him. A moment later she hears a noise outside and finds a pot of broth sent from Haymitch. She realizes that Haymitch will reward her for playing up the romance between her and Peeta. The next morning Katniss sees that Peeta’s leg is badly infected and he’ll die without treatment. Another announcement is made, this time saying each tribute will find an item they desperately need at the Cornucopia. Katniss knows that means medicine for Peeta’s leg, but Peeta thinks it’s too dangerous and doesn’t want Katniss to go. Using a sleep syrup sent from Haymitch, Katniss knocks him out.
At the Cornucopia, Katniss tries to run and grab the item marked for District 12, but she gets into a fight with a female tribute. The tribute is about to kill her when Thresh, the male tribute from District 11 who came to the Games with Rue, kills the girl instead. He spares Katniss because of the way she treated Rue, and Katniss makes it back to the cave. She injects Peeta with the medicine just before passing out. They stay there for a few days while it rains nonstop outside, and in this time the romance between Katniss and Peeta progresses. When the rain lets up, Peeta and Katniss need to find food. Katniss leaves Peeta in charge of foraging while she goes to hunt. She comes back hours later and finds a small pile of poisonous berries Peeta collected thinking they were safe. They discover the body of a tribute who Katniss nicknamed Foxface, and Katniss realizes she died from eating the berries. By this point Cato, who killed Thresh, is the only tribute left, and Katniss decides to keep some berries in case they can trick Cato the same way. Eventually the streams and ponds dry up, and they know the only source of water left is the lake near the Cornucopia. Without any other choice, they start walking to the lake.
By the lake, Cato comes suddenly barreling toward them. Unexpectedly, however, he runs straight by them. Katniss realizes there are strange creatures chasing him, and they all run to the Cornucopia and climb up. The creatures are mutant wolves engineered by the Capitol, and Katniss realizes they are actually the dead tributes, who have been turned into these monsters. Taking advantage of the situation, Cato attacks Peeta, but Katniss and Peeta manage to push him over the edge. The creatures overpower him, but because of the body armor he’s wearing he remains alive for hours, until Katniss shoots him out of pity. Just as Katniss and Peeta think they’ve won, another announcement is made that there can only be one winner again. Neither Katniss nor Peeta will kill the other, so Katniss takes out the poisonous berries. Just as she and Peeta pop them in their mouths, the announcer shouts for them to stop and declares them both winners.
They go back to the Training Center and Katniss is kept alone for days while she recuperates. When she is let out, Haymitch warns her that she’s in danger. The Capitol took her stunt with the berries as an act of defiance, so she has to convince everyone that she was desperate at the thought of losing Peeta and not being rebellious, or even her family could be at risk. In their final interview, she’s reunited with Peeta, who lost his leg and now has a prosthetic. After, when Haymitch tells her she did great, Peeta wonders what he means, and Katniss explains everything, including the romance strategy during the Games. Peeta is angry and hurt, but as they arrive back in District 12, they hold hands one more time to greet the crowd and cameras."
Obstructed,"In this book, originally published in 1903, W. E. B. Du Bois has collected fourteen of his own essays about life after the Civil War, especially in the South. While the book predominantly deals with Black society and the life of “freedmen,” it also discusses how white society evolved after Emancipation. Throughout the text, Du Bois presents specific examples of racial injustice and inequality in the South. Before each essay, Du Bois includes a poem (or an excerpt from a poem or song) appropriate to the essay’s subject matter. Every inclusion is “a bar of the Sorrow Songs,—some echo of haunting melody from the only American music which welled up from the black souls in the dark past.” Du Bois revisits the significance of these inclusions at the end of the book.
While each essay examines a particular piece of the evolution of Black society, they are arranged to give the reader a historical perspective. Chapter I and Chapter II deal with the history and immediate impact of Emancipation, using historical examples and Du Bois’s own experience. Chapter III. specifically discusses the formation and responsibility of Black leadership, while criticizing Booker T. Washington on an academic level. Du Bois goes on to describe the Atlanta Compromise and the limitations it has placed on Black society in the South. Chapter IV through Chapter VII discuss the need for progress, and how it is blocked by lack of education and opportunity. He stresses that current systems produce mostly laborers, and that there is little room for Black upward mobility, especially in the South, due to a lack of education (and college-educated individuals). In Chapter VIII and Chapter IX, Du Bois describes visiting Dougherty County in rural Georgia. His first-hand experiences there are contrasted with his upbringing in New England, to show not only that there is greater disparity in the South, but also that many Black people in the South are not fully aware of it. In Chapter VI and Chapter VII, Du Bois draws on analogies to mythology to better explain the challenges he sees in the upbringing of Black men. In Chapter X., Du Bois examines the religion of the Black South. 
Chapters XI, XII, and XIII offer narrative examples of individuals Du Bois has encountered and events from Du Bois’s own life to illustrate the disparity between white and Black society. He discusses the death of his young son, pays tribute to a world-traveling preacher who remained undiscouraged, and recalls a student who had great potential but was a victim of his circumstances. Du Bois admits that these men are not well-known to history, but he considers their experiences are worthy of study. The final chapter, Chapter XIV, has several selections of “Sorrow Songs” that Du Bois describes as the “spiritual heritage of the nation.” He describes how the songs have been handed down, many from before slavery, and how they have become interconnected with religion and are still a centerpiece in Black society. 
Throughout the work, Du Bois uses historical fact and narrative example to establish how slavery and its aftereffects have shaped both Black and white society in the South. As a teacher, he then examines each situation academically. He presents cause and effect relationships and applies sociological analysis to them. The largest problem Du Bois discusses is the shortage of resources and opportunity for Black people at the beginning of the 20th century. He points out the effects of disparities in education and privilege and demonstrates the need for change."
Ago,"Jack Worthing, the play’s protagonist, is a pillar of the community in Hertfordshire, where he is guardian to Cecily Cardew, the pretty, eighteen-year-old granddaughter of the late Thomas Cardew, who found and adopted Jack when he was a baby. In Hertfordshire, Jack has responsibilities: he is a major landowner and justice of the peace, with tenants, farmers, and a number of servants and other employees all dependent on him. For years, he has also pretended to have an irresponsible black-sheep brother named Ernest who leads a scandalous life in pursuit of pleasure and is always getting into trouble of a sort that requires Jack to rush grimly off to his assistance. In fact, Ernest is merely Jack’s alibi, a phantom that allows him to disappear for days at a time and do as he likes. No one but Jack knows that he himself is Ernest. Ernest is the name Jack goes by in London, which is where he really goes on these occasions—probably to pursue the very sort of behavior he pretends to disapprove of in his imaginary brother.
Jack is in love with Gwendolen Fairfax, the cousin of his best friend, Algernon Moncrieff. When the play opens, Algernon, who knows Jack as Ernest, has begun to suspect something, having found an inscription inside Jack’s cigarette case addressed to “Uncle Jack” from someone who refers to herself as “little Cecily.” Algernon suspects that Jack may be leading a double life, a practice he seems to regard as commonplace and indispensable to modern life. He calls a person who leads a double life a “Bunburyist,” after a nonexistent friend he pretends to have, a chronic invalid named Bunbury, to whose deathbed he is forever being summoned whenever he wants to get out of some tiresome social obligation.
At the beginning of Act 1, Jack drops in unexpectedly on Algernon and announces that he intends to propose to Gwendolen. Algernon confronts him with the cigarette case and forces him to come clean, demanding to know who “Jack” and “Cecily” are. Jack confesses that his name isn’t really Ernest and that Cecily is his ward, a responsibility imposed on him by his adoptive father’s will. Jack also tells Algernon about his fictional brother. Jack says he’s been thinking of killing off this fake brother, since Cecily has been showing too active an interest in him. Without meaning to, Jack describes Cecily in terms that catch Algernon’s attention and make him even more interested in her than he is already.
Gwendolen and her mother, Lady Bracknell, arrive, which gives Jack an opportunity to propose to Gwendolen. Jack is delighted to discover that Gwendolen returns his affections, but he is alarmed to learn that Gwendolen is fixated on the name Ernest, which she says “inspires absolute confidence.” Gwendolen makes clear that she would not consider marrying a man who was not named Ernest.
Lady Bracknell interviews Jack to determine his eligibility as a possible son-in-law, and during this interview she asks about his family background. When Jack explains that he has no idea who his parents were and that he was found, by the man who adopted him, in a handbag in the cloakroom at Victoria Station, Lady Bracknell is scandalized. She forbids the match between Jack and Gwendolen and sweeps out of the house.
In Act 2, Algernon shows up at Jack’s country estate posing as Jack’s brother Ernest. Meanwhile, Jack, having decided that Ernest has outlived his usefulness, arrives home in deep mourning, full of a story about Ernest having died suddenly in Paris. He is enraged to find Algernon there masquerading as Ernest but has to go along with the charade. If he doesn’t, his own lies and deceptions will be revealed.
While Jack changes out of his mourning clothes, Algernon, who has fallen hopelessly in love with Cecily, asks her to marry him. He is surprised to discover that Cecily already considers that they are engaged, and he is charmed when she reveals that her fascination with “Uncle Jack’s brother” led her to invent an elaborate romance between herself and him several months ago. Algernon is less enchanted to learn that part of Cecily’s interest in him derives from the name Ernest, which, unconsciously echoing Gwendolen, she says “inspires absolute confidence.”
Algernon goes off in search of Dr. Chasuble, the local rector, to see about getting himself christened Ernest. Meanwhile, Gwendolen arrives, having decided to pay Jack an unexpected visit. Gwendolen is shown into the garden, where Cecily orders tea and attempts to play hostess. Cecily has no idea how Gwendolen figures into Jack’s life, and Gwendolen, for her part, has no idea who Cecily is. Gwendolen initially thinks Cecily is a visitor to the Manor House and is disconcerted to learn that Cecily is “Mr. Worthing’s ward.” She notes that Ernest has never mentioned having a ward, and Cecily explains that it is not Ernest Worthing who is her guardian but his brother Jack and, in fact, that she is engaged to be married to Ernest Worthing. Gwendolen points out that this is impossible as she herself is engaged to Ernest Worthing. The tea party degenerates into a war of manners.
Jack and Algernon arrive toward the climax of this confrontation, each having separately made arrangements with Dr. Chasuble to be christened Ernest later that day. Each of the young ladies points out that the other has been deceived: Cecily informs Gwendolen that her fiancé is really named Jack and Gwendolen informs Cecily that hers is really called Algernon. The two women demand to know where Jack’s brother Ernest is, since both of them are engaged to be married to him. Jack is forced to admit that he has no brother and that Ernest is a complete fiction. Both women are shocked and furious, and they retire to the house arm in arm.
Act 3 takes place in the drawing room of the Manor House, where Cecily and Gwendolen have retired. When Jack and Algernon enter from the garden, the two women confront them. Cecily asks Algernon why he pretended to be her guardian’s brother. Algernon tells her he did it in order to meet her. Gwendolen asks Jack whether he pretended to have a brother in order to come into London to see her as often as possible, and she interprets his evasive reply as an affirmation. The women are somewhat appeased but still concerned over the issue of the name. However, when Jack and Algernon tell Gwendolen and Cecily that they have both made arrangements to be christened Ernest that afternoon, all is forgiven and the two pairs of lovers embrace. At this moment, Lady Bracknell’s arrival is announced.
Lady Bracknell has followed Gwendolen from London, having bribed Gwendolen’s maid to reveal her destination. She demands to know what is going on. Gwendolen again informs Lady Bracknell of her engagement to Jack, and Lady Bracknell reiterates that a union between them is out of the question. Algernon tells Lady Bracknell of his engagement to Cecily, prompting her to inspect Cecily and inquire into her social connections, which she does in a routine and patronizing manner that infuriates Jack. He replies to all her questions with a mixture of civility and sarcasm, withholding until the last possible moment the information that Cecily is actually worth a great deal of money and stands to inherit still more when she comes of age. At this, Lady Bracknell becomes genuinely interested.
Jack informs Lady Bracknell that, as Cecily’s legal guardian, he refuses to give his consent to her union with Algernon. Lady Bracknell suggests that the two young people simply wait until Cecily comes of age, and Jack points out that under the terms of her grandfather’s will, Cecily does not legally come of age until she is thirty-five. Lady Bracknell asks Jack to reconsider, and he points out that the matter is entirely in her own hands. As soon as she consents to his marriage to Gwendolen, Cecily can have his consent to marry Algernon. However, Lady Bracknell refuses to entertain the notion. She and Gwendolen are on the point of leaving when Dr. Chasuble arrives and happens to mention Cecily’s governess, Miss Prism. At this, Lady Bracknell starts and asks that Miss Prism be sent for.
When the governess arrives and catches sight of Lady Bracknell, she begins to look guilty and furtive. Lady Bracknell accuses her of having left her sister’s house twenty-eight years before with a baby and never returned. She demands to know where the baby is. Miss Prism confesses she doesn’t know, explaining that she lost the baby, having absentmindedly placed it in a handbag in which she had meant to place the manuscript for a novel she had written. Jack asks what happened to the bag, and Miss Prism says she left it in the cloakroom of a railway station. Jack presses her for further details and goes racing offstage, returning a few moments later with a large handbag. When Miss Prism confirms that the bag is hers, Jack throws himself on her with a cry of “Mother!” It takes a while before the situation is sorted out, but before too long we understand that Jack is not the illegitimate child of Miss Prism but the legitimate child of Lady Bracknell’s sister and, therefore, Algernon’s older brother. Furthermore, Jack had been originally christened “Ernest John.” All these years Jack has unwittingly been telling the truth: Ernest is his name, as is Jack, and he does have an unprincipled younger brother—Algernon. Again the couples embrace, Miss Prism and Dr. Chasuble follow suit, and Jack acknowledges that he now understands “the vital Importance of Being Earnest.”"
Took,"Kidnapped tells the story of David Balfour, a young man of the Lowlands, the southern part of Scotland. David's father, Alexander Balfour, has recently died, and his mother died some time before, so he is now an orphan. Since he is now seventeen years old, he has decided it is time to go and seek his fortune. Before he leaves for the city of Edinburgh, he meets with his guardian, Mr. Campbell. Campbell reveals that David has an uncle, Ebenezer Balfour, of the House of Shaws—meaning that David is, to his surprise, from a wealthy family. David decides to go to Cramond, where his uncle lives, and meet his wealthy relatives.
David walks two days to Edinburgh, and soon finds his way to Cramond. As he begins to ask about the House of Shaws, he finds it is an unpopular place. His Uncle Ebenezer seems particularly ill regarded by the community, and is in fact the only occupant of the house. Nevertheless, David continues on to the House of Shaws. Ebenezer gives him a cold welcome, and seems very interested in the death of David's father. Ebenezer treats David badly, almost as if David were a thief, but he wins some of David's respect by giving the lad nearly forty pounds. But when Ebenezer nearly sends David to his death in the tower adjacent to the house, David demands to know why his uncle hates him and, if he does, why he wants him to stay at the House of Shaws.
A cabin boy, Ransome, arrives at the House of Shaws. He has been sent by Captain Hoseason of the Covenant, a ship that deals with some of Ebenezer's financial ventures. Hoseason has requested to see Ebenezer, so the old man decides to go to the port of Queensferry with Ransome and David. David is interested in seeing the ships at the port, so he willingly goes along. At first, Hoseason seems very pleasant. He even warns David that Ebenezer means mischief toward him. Hoseason then asks to speak to David on the boat, and David agrees, being interested in seeing more of the boat. Once he is on, however, the boat swiftly departs, and as he screams at the dock for help, the sailors knock David unconscious.
He awakes in the dark storage deck of the Covenant. As he drifts in and out of sleep, he quickly becomes ill, and soon he is lingering near death. The ship's mate, Riach, demands that the boy be allowed to sleep in the healthier forecastle of the ship with the other sailors. Hoseason reluctantly agrees, and as David recovers he becomes friends with Riach and a few of the other sailors. Then, Ransome is accidentally killed by Mr. Shuan, and David becomes the new cabin boy.
After a few days at this new job, the Covenant strikes and sinks another boat. One man survives, a strange Highland man dressed in the clothing of a French soldier. The stranger tells the captain that he is carrying the rent money for his disenfranchised chieftain. The two men make an agreement that Hoseason will drop the stranger off in Linnhe Loch, but no sooner is the captain gone from the Round-House—the officers' lounge where the visiting stranger is kept—when David overhears the officers plotting to murder the stranger and take his belt. David tells this to the stranger, and agrees to fight by his side. The stranger says his name is Alan Breck Stewart. Alan and David successfully defend the Round-House from the sailors, Alan killing several men and even David taking two himself. Alan, impressed with David's courage, gives David a silver button from his coat. The captain and Alan negotiate, and the captain agrees to drop Alan and David off near Linnhe Loch.
On the way, however, the ship strikes the Torran Rocks and goes down. David escapes and finds himself on an island. The island is separated from a larger main island only by a river, but he can find no way to cross the river. After a few days, a fisherman comes in a boat and reveals to him that the river gets very low at high tide, and David crosses easily.
David then stays at a house, and discovers that Alan himself passed through, having survived the wreck. Alan left instructions that David should follow him to Torosay, and from there go to Alan's homeland of Appin. David heads this way, meeting several disreputable people along the way, including a notorious blind robber; but the young man manages to avoid any great dangers. He meets a pleasant old religious instructor, Henderland, who helps David secure a boat to take him to Appin.
As soon as David arrives in Appin, he comes across a group of four men on horseback. One of the men is Colin Campbell, the King's Regent for that area, whose clan, the Campbells, are hated by Alan and his Stewart clan. As David speaks with Campbell, he is suddenly shot and killed by an unknown assailant. One of the people in Campbell's party accuses David of distracting Campbell so that he could be shot, and just as soldiers are about to apprehend David he is pulled away by Alan, who has been fishing nearby.
Alan and David, now major suspects in the murder, flee to the woods. Alan swears he had nothing to do with the murder, but he must now draw attention away from the real killer. David believes Alan, and they escape to the home of James Stewart, or James of the Glens. James gives them a change of clothes and some little money, but he tells them that he will have to blame them for the murder and put our warrants for their arrest once they are safely gone, so that he will not be blamed for the murder. If James is killed, it will mean great difficulties for the Stewart clan. David and Alan agree to be the scapegoats, and Alan and David are soon fleeing through the wilderness once more.
They hide for a whole day on top of a large rock while English soldiers roam around below, searching for them. They escape and go to a mountain where they rest for several days and send word to James, hoping to get a little more money so that Alan can escape to France. The messenger returns with a note from James' wife; James has been arrested for the murder. She also sends a little more money for David and Alan.
The two continue on their flight, soon reaching the broad, flat region known as the moors. They take some time out to rest, but David oversleeps on his watch, and a troop of English soldiers nearly takes them by surprise. They must run through the wide, flat land on their hands and knees, hiding in small brush and behind rocks. They manage to escape and are ambushed by Highland men who, fortunately, turn out to be men of Cluny Macpherson, another disenfranchised Highland leader. Cluny takes them in his hideout in the mountain of Ben Alder, and while David sleeps for nearly three days, Alan and Cluny play cards. Alan gambles away all their money, including David's. Cluny agrees to give them their money back, plus more, but Cluny is mortified that they thought he would keep the money, David is angry that Alan gambled it away and he has to swallow his pride and ask for it back, and Alan feels guilty for having gambled it all away.
Alan and David continue on their journey toward the Lowlands, but David is now angry and bitter toward Alan. Alan feels remorseful for some time, but when David refuses to warm up at all, Alan thinks that he has personally suffered enough, and soon becomes his usual happy self, taunting David for being a Whig. Alan is a Jacobite, someone who believed the Stuarts, a Highland clan, should be on the throne, whereas Whigs were supporters of the current English monarchy, following the line of William and Mary. David's patience wears thin, and he viciously attacks Alan's honor. Realizing he cannot be forgiven for what he said, David pretends that he is about to die of exhaustion, and Alan becomes very worried and takes David to a house.
Over the course of a month, David recovers. There is some brief trouble when Alan meets Robin Oig, one of the sons of the well-known Highlander Rob Roy Macgregor, who was also a Campbell. But instead of using guns, they duel by playing the bagpipes, and the two men quickly respect one another and a crisis is averted.
David and Alan finally move on and, after some difficulties, reach Queensferry once more. They cross over and David meets with his family's lawyer, Mr. Rankeillor. Rankeillor believes his story, but David's uncle Ebenezer must be dealt with somehow. It turns out that Ebenezer and David's father had had a dispute over a woman, David's mother. They had finally come to an agreement—David's father married his mother, and Ebenezer took the estate and the Balfour fortune, although he was not the elder brother. Rankeillor says the agreement is not legally binding, and that David is the true heir of the estate. But David does not want the House of Shaws, just a pension from its yearly earnings.
To rectify the situation, David plays a trick on Ebenezer. Rankeillor, David, and Alan go to the House of Shaws. Alan walks up to the door alone, and pretends that he is from a bunch of Highlanders who found David alive shortly after the shipwreck on the Torran Rocks. He asks for money to return to the boy, but Ebenezer refuses to pay anything. Alan then says that they'll kill him unless Ebenezer pays to have him kept alive. Ebenezer does not want the boy dead, and as he haggles over how much he will pay he admits that the plan had been for Hoseason to sell the boy into slavery in the Carolinas. At that point, David and Rankeillor reveal themselves, having caught Ebenezer in the confession. Ebenezer and Rankeillor then work out an agreement that David would get two-thirds of the yearly income of the House of Shaws.
David receives a note from Rankeillor that will allow him to collect his money. David then speaks to Alan, and arranges to send him money so that Alan can get passage to France. The two men part, and David wanders into town to claim his fortune."
Where,"The body of Chase Andrews is found by two boys next to an abandoned fire tower in the swamp on October 30, 1969.
In 1952, six-year-old Kya watches her mother leave their shack in the marsh. Before long, her siblings, including her beloved 12-year-old brother Jodie, depart too, leaving Kya alone with Pa, a drunken, disabled World War II vet prone to violent rages. Pa gives Kya a dollar a week for food. In town, older boys, including Chase Andrews, pass her on their bikes. Kya spends most of her time in the marsh with the gulls.
Mrs. Culpepper, a truant officer, takes Kya to school, where she is humiliated and never returns. Over the years, townspeople call her “dirty,” “the Marsh Girl,” “Missing Link,” and “marsh trash.”
Kya takes Pa’s fishing boat exploring. When she gets lost, one of Jodie’s friends, Tate Walker, guides her back to her channel. Tate lives alone in town with his dad, Scupper, a fisherman. 
For a while, Kya and Pa fish together and enjoy each other’s company. Pa introduces Kya to Jumpin’, an older Black man who sells gas and supplies. Kya’s mother sends a letter, but Pa burns it and returns to drinking. Pa finally disappears when Kya is ten years old. Kya supports herself selling mussels to Jumpin’, whose wife Mabel collects clothes for Kya from Colored Town. Kya continues watching Tate as well as Chase and his friends.
When she is 14 years old, Kya finds a series of special feathers left in a tree stump in the marsh. One day, she leaves a special feather in return. After that, Tate appears at the stump and offers to teach her to read. Tate and Kya begin to meet at a secret cabin in the marsh where he teaches her to read. As Kya matures, Tate brings her a biology textbook and Mabel gives her a bra. One day Tate finds Kya sick on Point Beach. He explains to her that she is having her period. Kya and Tate continue their lessons and she invites him inside her shack and shows him her collection of natural objects. One day, Tate kisses Kya and they begin a romantic relationship. Their desire grows but they avoid having sex. Tate leaves early for college and tells Kya he will visit on the 4th of July. However, he doesn’t return. Kya, devastated, returns to studying nature.
When Kya is 19 years old, Chase catches her eye on Point Beach. He is a popular, good looking, confident, former high school quarterback. Chase approaches Kya on Jumpin’s wharf and invites her on a picnic. 
At the picnic, Chase gives Kya a rare scallop shell. He is sexually aggressive and she runs away. When Kya and Chase meet ten days later, he apologizes and takes her to see the abandoned fire tower. Kya gives Chase a necklace made from the scallop shell. Chase says he won’t approach her sexually unless she wants him to.
Kya gets closer to Chase. Tate, who is home from college, wants to apologize to Kya, but sees her kissing Chase and turns away. Chase starts talking about marriage and invites Kya on an overnight trip. She joins him and they have unsatisfying sex in a cheap motel room. Still, their relationship continues. However, Chase won’t introduce Kya to his parents or friends and disappears for a week over Christmas. 
Tate comes to the lagoon to warn Kya that Chase is seeing other women, but she throws rocks at him. Still, she invites him into the shack and he offers to find a publisher for a book of her nature paintings. 
Kya sees the engagement announcement in the newspaper for Chase and Pearl, a girl she recognizes from Point Beach. She recites poems by Amanda Hamilton, who publishes in the local newspaper, to soothe herself. She determines to live her life alone.
A year later, Kya receives a copy of her first book. She uses the advance money to improve and modernize the shack. She gives Tate a copy of her book. 
Kya’s brother Jodie visits the shack. He tells her that Ma has died and promises to keep in touch. He encourages her to reconcile with Tate.
In August of 1969, Chase sneaks up on Kya on a remote beach, attacks and tries to rape her. She fights him off and sees two fishermen watching from their boat as she leaves. Tate and Jumpin’ see her bruises, but she begs them not to tell anyone. Chase continues to come to her shack, but she hides from him. Kya gets a letter from her publisher, Robert Foster, to meet him in Greenville. She finds out from Tate how to buy a bus ticket and goes to meet him on October 28, returning on October 30, the day Chase’s body is found.
Sheriff Ed Jackson and his deputy Joe Perdue investigate Chase’s death. No footprints or fingerprints are found at the scene. They think Chase was pushed through an open gate and the murderer covered up the scene. Almost immediately, everyone in town suspects “the Marsh Girl.” 
Over time, Joe and Ed’s main clue consists of red wool fibers on Chase’s jacket. Also, Chase’s mother Patti Love tells them Chase was wearing the shell necklace when he left her house that night, but it was not found at the scene. A shrimper, Hal Miller, tells them he saw Kya’s boat headed toward the fire tower the night Chase died. However, Tate and Jumpin’ and townspeople who saw her get on and off the bus to Greenville give Kya an alibi. A fisherman, Rodney Horn, who heard Kya yelling and saw her leaving after Chase attacked her, heard her say she would kill Chase if he bothered her again. Joe and Ed find a red wool hat in Kya’s shack that Tate gave her and that matches the fibers on Chase’s coat. With this information, they arrest Kya for murder.
Kya spends two months in jail awaiting trial. A lawyer, Tom Milton, volunteers to defend her. 
A kind guard at the prison, Jacob, lets the cat, Sunday Justice, into her cell for company. Tate, Jumpin’, and Mabel sit behind Kya in court for support. They are later joined by Jodie, Robert Foster, and Scupper. 
Prosecutor Eric Chastain calls his witnesses and Tom Milton counters their testimony. The jury learns that it would have been possible for Kya to take buses back and forth from Greenville on the night of the murder, but the timing is very tight. Tom calls defense witnesses, including Kya’s publisher Robert Foster. After closing statements, everyone awaits the verdict. Kya is found not guilty. Jodie takes her home, where she is delighted to see the marsh again. 
Kya sees Tate in his boat and is going to approach him, but the sheriff and two deputies arrive and take Tate with them. She learns that Scupper has had a stroke and died.
The day after Scupper’s funeral, Tate finds a feather in his boat from Kya. At the shack, they express their love for each other and Tate moves in with her. Over the years, Jumpin’ dies, and Jodie and his wife and children visit the shack. Tate works at the nearby lab and Kya writes seven more books. 
One day Tate finds Kya in her boat, dead of a heart attack at age 64. On her tombstone, he inscribes “The Marsh Girl.” Many townspeople come to Kya’s funeral on her land. That night, Tate finds two items beneath the floorboards. One is a box of poems by Amanda Hamilton, a pseudonym Kya used, including a poem describing Chase Andrews’ death. Tate also finds the shell necklace Kya gave Chase. Tate burns the poems and rawhide cord and crushes the shell on the beach for the tide to take away."
Hitherto,"The full title of Swift's pamphlet is ""A Modest Proposal for Preventing the Children of Poor People from Being a Burthen to their Parents, or the Country, and for Making them Beneficial to the Publick."" The tract is an ironically conceived attempt to ""find out a fair, cheap, and easy Method"" for converting the starving children of Ireland into ""sound and useful members of the Commonwealth."" Across the country poor children, predominantly Catholics, are living in squalor because their families are too poor to keep them fed and clothed.
The author argues, by hard-edged economic reasoning as well as from a self-righteous moral stance, for a way to turn this problem into its own solution. His proposal, in effect, is to fatten up these undernourished children and feed them to Ireland's rich land-owners. Children of the poor could be sold into a meat market at the age of one, he argues, thus combating overpopulation and unemployment, sparing families the expense of child-bearing while providing them with a little extra income, improving the culinary experience of the wealthy, and contributing to the overall economic well-being of the nation.
The author offers statistical support for his assertions and gives specific data about the number of children to be sold, their weight and price, and the projected consumption patterns. He suggests some recipes for preparing this delicious new meat, and he feels sure that innovative cooks will be quick to generate more. He also anticipates that the practice of selling and eating children will have positive effects on family morality: husbands will treat their wives with more respect, and parents will value their children in ways hitherto unknown. His conclusion is that the implementation of this project will do more to solve Ireland's complex social, political, and economic problems than any other measure that has been proposed."
Confirmed,"The narrator, Frank McCourt, describes how his parents meet in Brooklyn, New York. After his mother, Angela, becomes pregnant with Frank, she marries Malachy, the father of her child. Angela struggles to feed her growing family of sons, while Malachy spends his wages on alcohol. Frank’s much-loved baby sister, Margaret, dies and Angela falls into depression. The McCourts decide to return to Ireland. More troubles plague the McCourts in Ireland: Angela has a miscarriage, Frank’s two younger brothers die, and Malachy continues to drink away the family’s money.
	Frank’s childhood is described as a time of great deprivation, but of good humor and adventure as well. When the first floor of the house floods during the winter, Angela and Malachy announce that the family will leave the cold damp of the first floor, which they call “Ireland,” and move to the warm, cozy second floor, which they call “Italy.” Although Malachy’s alcoholism uses up all of the money for food, he earns Frank’s love and affection by entertaining him with stories about Irish heroes and the people who live on their lane.
	Over the course of a few years, Angela gives birth to two sons, Michael and Alphonsus. Alphosus is called “Alphie” for short. As Frank grows older, the narration increasingly focuses on his exploits at school. When Frank turns ten, he is confirmed (Confirmation is a ritual that makes one an official Christian or Catholic. When Frank was growing up, people were confirmed around ages seven to ten). Right after his confirmation, Frank falls ill with typhoid fever and must stay in the hospital for months. There, he gets his first introduction to Shakespeare. Frank finds comfort in stories of all kinds, from Shakespeare to movies to newspapers. By the time he returns to school, his gift for language is obvious. In particular, Frank’s flair for storytelling gets him noticed by his teacher.
	With the onset of World War II, many fathers in Limerick go to England to find work and send money back to their families. Eventually, Malachy goes as well, but he fails to send money home. Frank begins to work for Mr. Hannon. This is the first in a series of jobs. Frank will go on to work for Mr. Timoney, Uncle Ab, the post office, Mrs. Finucane, and Mr. McCaffrey. Frank enjoys the feeling of responsibility he gets from working, and he dreams of saving enough to provide his family with food and clothes.
	The McCourts get evicted from their lodgings and must move in with Angela’s cousin Laman. Angela begins sleeping with Laman, an arrangement that makes Frank increasingly uncomfortable and angry. He also begins to feel guilty about his own sexual feelings. The priests’ strict mandates against masturbation make Frank feel guilty when he masturbates.
	While working as a messenger boy, Frank begins a sexual relationship with a customer, Theresa Carmody, who eventually dies of consumption, leaving Frank heartbroken. Frank saves enough money to get to New York. On his first night there, he attends a party and sleeps with an American woman. Though sad to leave behind Ireland and his family, Frank has great expectations for the future."
Management,"Washington relates the story of his life from birth to late adulthood, while introducing his theory for racial uplift and using his own personal story as example. His life begins on a plantation in Franklin County, Virginia. Following Emancipation and the end of the Civil War, Washington and his family, including his mother, his stepfather, his sister, and his older brother, move to Malden, Virginia, where Washington’s stepfather secures work at a salt-furnace. The first few years out of slavery are difficult for the family, but Washington is a curious, ambitious child and pursues his desire for an education. His first glimpse of education comes from his labor at the salt-furnace. Following this, Washington receives a spelling-book from his mother and with it, masters the alphabet. When a literate Black man from Ohio arrives, he offers his services as a teacher to the town’s Black population. In this way, Washington begins to develop academically.
Eventually, a school that holds both day and night classes opens in a nearby town and Washington attends after his work each day at the salt-furnace. At work, Washington hears word of a new school for Black students called the Hampton Institute and vows to go there for his education. He continues to work to raise money to travel to Hampton, Virginia, where the school is located. He stops working at the salt-furnace and begins to work for the owner’s wife, Mrs. Ruffner, as a servant. Mrs. Ruffner teaches Washington the strictures of civilized living: order, cleanliness, promptness. Washington also begins his first personal library at this time. After a short while, Washington heads off to Hampton. On his journey to Hampton, the stage-coach that he takes to the train station in the next town stops at a hotel. The hotel-keeper refuses to give Washington a room because of his race. Washington, consequently, sleeps outside.
After this episode, Washington walks and hitches rides to Richmond, Virginia. He reaches Richmond at night and sleeps under a raised sidewalk. The next morning, he finds work loading and unloading ships. He continues to sleep under the raised sidewalk as he earns money for the rest of his trip to Hampton. When he arrives at Hampton, his general appearance and the state of his clothing make a poor first impression. The head teacher admits several students to the school ahead of him and finally asks him to sweep the room adjoining the main hall. Washington sweeps the room as thoroughly as possible and so impresses the head teacher that he is admitted to the school and offered a position as a janitor. This provides Washington with a way to pay for his room and board, as well as a portion of his tuition.
A new life begins for Washington at Hampton. Hampton introduces Washington to the dignity in hard work and labor and teaches him the value and virtue of selflessness. Both lessons will later form the foundation of Washington’s social program for racial uplift. The man who makes the strongest impression upon Washington at Hampton is the school’s founder, General Samuel C. Armstrong. Armstrong admires Washington’s selflessness and his strength of leadership. At Hampton, Washington works at his studies and is an enthusiastic participant in the school’s debating societies. Washington does not return home to Malden, Virginia, until after his second year of school.
Washington’s mother dies during this summer and the event throws his family life into disarray. Washington considers not returning to Hampton, but his desire for an education is strong. He returns to Hampton and eventually graduates. After graduation, he returns to Malden where he opens a school for the Black community. Washington’s curriculum for the school extends beyond “mere book education” to include lessons on proper grooming, personal comportment, and personal industry. In addition to teaching the school, Washington also starts a night-school, multiple debating societies, and establishes a reading room. After two years teaching in Malden, Washington goes to Washington, D.C. to further his studies. Washington eventually returns to Hampton as a teacher and his first work at the school is to teach newly admitted Native American students. The experience solidifies Washington’s beliefs in hard work and selflessness. Washington teaches the Native American students how to operate in white society as well as traditional academic subjects.
His success at Hampton leads to an invitation to head a new school in Alabama. Once Washington reaches Tuskegee, Alabama, he finds eager students but no proper building in which to hold a school. For the first few months, Washington holds the school in a shanty located near a church. Eventually, Washington purchases an old plantation for the school. Washington, alongside his students, labors to repair the buildings to make them suitable as classrooms. He also has the students plant crops to make Tuskegee self-sustaining. These early experiments in student labor become part of the foundational curriculum at Tuskegee, each student having to learn a trade or industry alongside more traditional academic subjects.
During this time, Washington makes many trips North to raise money for the school and as a result, establishes a profile as a public speaker and Black leader. Washington begins to receive invitations to speak at all manner of events. By the time he receives the invitation to deliver what will become his most famous speech at the Atlanta Cotton States and International Exposition, his views about the proper approach to racial advancement and uplift have crystallized. In his speech at the Atlanta Exposition, which will later become known as the ""Atlanta compromise,"" Washington exhorts former slaves to “cast down [their] bucket[s] where you are” and expresses opposition to political agitation. Washington also emphasizes racial intermingling only for common business interests, and otherwise says that the races “can be as separate as the fingers.” This speech catapults Washington to a new level of fame and renown, despite vocal detractors. The speech summed up Washington's belief that Black Americans could succeed and prosper through hard work and education, while not directly challenging the status quo of segregation and the loss of the voting rights that had been taken away from them Jim Crow took hold.
Washington ends the book by reflecting on the legacy of Tuskegee and his hope for the race in the coming years. He is optimistic about both because of the large distance he himself has traveled."
Earnest,"Jack Worthing, the play’s protagonist, is a pillar of the community in Hertfordshire, where he is guardian to Cecily Cardew, the pretty, eighteen-year-old granddaughter of the late Thomas Cardew, who found and adopted Jack when he was a baby. In Hertfordshire, Jack has responsibilities: he is a major landowner and justice of the peace, with tenants, farmers, and a number of servants and other employees all dependent on him. For years, he has also pretended to have an irresponsible black-sheep brother named Ernest who leads a scandalous life in pursuit of pleasure and is always getting into trouble of a sort that requires Jack to rush grimly off to his assistance. In fact, Ernest is merely Jack’s alibi, a phantom that allows him to disappear for days at a time and do as he likes. No one but Jack knows that he himself is Ernest. Ernest is the name Jack goes by in London, which is where he really goes on these occasions—probably to pursue the very sort of behavior he pretends to disapprove of in his imaginary brother.
Jack is in love with Gwendolen Fairfax, the cousin of his best friend, Algernon Moncrieff. When the play opens, Algernon, who knows Jack as Ernest, has begun to suspect something, having found an inscription inside Jack’s cigarette case addressed to “Uncle Jack” from someone who refers to herself as “little Cecily.” Algernon suspects that Jack may be leading a double life, a practice he seems to regard as commonplace and indispensable to modern life. He calls a person who leads a double life a “Bunburyist,” after a nonexistent friend he pretends to have, a chronic invalid named Bunbury, to whose deathbed he is forever being summoned whenever he wants to get out of some tiresome social obligation.
At the beginning of Act 1, Jack drops in unexpectedly on Algernon and announces that he intends to propose to Gwendolen. Algernon confronts him with the cigarette case and forces him to come clean, demanding to know who “Jack” and “Cecily” are. Jack confesses that his name isn’t really Ernest and that Cecily is his ward, a responsibility imposed on him by his adoptive father’s will. Jack also tells Algernon about his fictional brother. Jack says he’s been thinking of killing off this fake brother, since Cecily has been showing too active an interest in him. Without meaning to, Jack describes Cecily in terms that catch Algernon’s attention and make him even more interested in her than he is already.
Gwendolen and her mother, Lady Bracknell, arrive, which gives Jack an opportunity to propose to Gwendolen. Jack is delighted to discover that Gwendolen returns his affections, but he is alarmed to learn that Gwendolen is fixated on the name Ernest, which she says “inspires absolute confidence.” Gwendolen makes clear that she would not consider marrying a man who was not named Ernest.
Lady Bracknell interviews Jack to determine his eligibility as a possible son-in-law, and during this interview she asks about his family background. When Jack explains that he has no idea who his parents were and that he was found, by the man who adopted him, in a handbag in the cloakroom at Victoria Station, Lady Bracknell is scandalized. She forbids the match between Jack and Gwendolen and sweeps out of the house.
In Act 2, Algernon shows up at Jack’s country estate posing as Jack’s brother Ernest. Meanwhile, Jack, having decided that Ernest has outlived his usefulness, arrives home in deep mourning, full of a story about Ernest having died suddenly in Paris. He is enraged to find Algernon there masquerading as Ernest but has to go along with the charade. If he doesn’t, his own lies and deceptions will be revealed.
While Jack changes out of his mourning clothes, Algernon, who has fallen hopelessly in love with Cecily, asks her to marry him. He is surprised to discover that Cecily already considers that they are engaged, and he is charmed when she reveals that her fascination with “Uncle Jack’s brother” led her to invent an elaborate romance between herself and him several months ago. Algernon is less enchanted to learn that part of Cecily’s interest in him derives from the name Ernest, which, unconsciously echoing Gwendolen, she says “inspires absolute confidence.”
Algernon goes off in search of Dr. Chasuble, the local rector, to see about getting himself christened Ernest. Meanwhile, Gwendolen arrives, having decided to pay Jack an unexpected visit. Gwendolen is shown into the garden, where Cecily orders tea and attempts to play hostess. Cecily has no idea how Gwendolen figures into Jack’s life, and Gwendolen, for her part, has no idea who Cecily is. Gwendolen initially thinks Cecily is a visitor to the Manor House and is disconcerted to learn that Cecily is “Mr. Worthing’s ward.” She notes that Ernest has never mentioned having a ward, and Cecily explains that it is not Ernest Worthing who is her guardian but his brother Jack and, in fact, that she is engaged to be married to Ernest Worthing. Gwendolen points out that this is impossible as she herself is engaged to Ernest Worthing. The tea party degenerates into a war of manners.
Jack and Algernon arrive toward the climax of this confrontation, each having separately made arrangements with Dr. Chasuble to be christened Ernest later that day. Each of the young ladies points out that the other has been deceived: Cecily informs Gwendolen that her fiancé is really named Jack and Gwendolen informs Cecily that hers is really called Algernon. The two women demand to know where Jack’s brother Ernest is, since both of them are engaged to be married to him. Jack is forced to admit that he has no brother and that Ernest is a complete fiction. Both women are shocked and furious, and they retire to the house arm in arm.
Act 3 takes place in the drawing room of the Manor House, where Cecily and Gwendolen have retired. When Jack and Algernon enter from the garden, the two women confront them. Cecily asks Algernon why he pretended to be her guardian’s brother. Algernon tells her he did it in order to meet her. Gwendolen asks Jack whether he pretended to have a brother in order to come into London to see her as often as possible, and she interprets his evasive reply as an affirmation. The women are somewhat appeased but still concerned over the issue of the name. However, when Jack and Algernon tell Gwendolen and Cecily that they have both made arrangements to be christened Ernest that afternoon, all is forgiven and the two pairs of lovers embrace. At this moment, Lady Bracknell’s arrival is announced.
Lady Bracknell has followed Gwendolen from London, having bribed Gwendolen’s maid to reveal her destination. She demands to know what is going on. Gwendolen again informs Lady Bracknell of her engagement to Jack, and Lady Bracknell reiterates that a union between them is out of the question. Algernon tells Lady Bracknell of his engagement to Cecily, prompting her to inspect Cecily and inquire into her social connections, which she does in a routine and patronizing manner that infuriates Jack. He replies to all her questions with a mixture of civility and sarcasm, withholding until the last possible moment the information that Cecily is actually worth a great deal of money and stands to inherit still more when she comes of age. At this, Lady Bracknell becomes genuinely interested.
Jack informs Lady Bracknell that, as Cecily’s legal guardian, he refuses to give his consent to her union with Algernon. Lady Bracknell suggests that the two young people simply wait until Cecily comes of age, and Jack points out that under the terms of her grandfather’s will, Cecily does not legally come of age until she is thirty-five. Lady Bracknell asks Jack to reconsider, and he points out that the matter is entirely in her own hands. As soon as she consents to his marriage to Gwendolen, Cecily can have his consent to marry Algernon. However, Lady Bracknell refuses to entertain the notion. She and Gwendolen are on the point of leaving when Dr. Chasuble arrives and happens to mention Cecily’s governess, Miss Prism. At this, Lady Bracknell starts and asks that Miss Prism be sent for.
When the governess arrives and catches sight of Lady Bracknell, she begins to look guilty and furtive. Lady Bracknell accuses her of having left her sister’s house twenty-eight years before with a baby and never returned. She demands to know where the baby is. Miss Prism confesses she doesn’t know, explaining that she lost the baby, having absentmindedly placed it in a handbag in which she had meant to place the manuscript for a novel she had written. Jack asks what happened to the bag, and Miss Prism says she left it in the cloakroom of a railway station. Jack presses her for further details and goes racing offstage, returning a few moments later with a large handbag. When Miss Prism confirms that the bag is hers, Jack throws himself on her with a cry of “Mother!” It takes a while before the situation is sorted out, but before too long we understand that Jack is not the illegitimate child of Miss Prism but the legitimate child of Lady Bracknell’s sister and, therefore, Algernon’s older brother. Furthermore, Jack had been originally christened “Ernest John.” All these years Jack has unwittingly been telling the truth: Ernest is his name, as is Jack, and he does have an unprincipled younger brother—Algernon. Again the couples embrace, Miss Prism and Dr. Chasuble follow suit, and Jack acknowledges that he now understands “the vital Importance of Being Earnest.”"
Subsidized,"In Outliers: The Story of Success, Malcolm Gladwell considers the circumstances that lead to success. The first half of the book looks closely at how opportunities matter more in the lives of successful people than hard work or raw talent. The second half of the book focuses on cultural legacies: behavioral tendencies rooted in their ancestral past.
Part One examines the role of opportunity in the lives of extremely successful people. Gladwell’s first example is the Canadian Hockey League, the world’s most competitive youth hockey league. Since the cutoff date for the Canadian leagues that serve the youngest players is January 1, those born in the first part of the calendar year are much larger and more coordinated than their peers. The larger and more coordinated kids are given more playing time and better coaching, and thus become better players by the time they reach the top league. An overwhelming majority of Canadian professional hockey players have birthdays in January, February or March.
Gladwell proposes that 10,000 hours of practice is needed to master a skill, even for prodigies like Mozart. Bill Joy, Bill Gates, and the Beatles all worked hard to achieve success but benefited from opportunities they did not create. Joy, one of the founders of Sun Microsystems, happened to attend one of the first colleges in the world with a time-sharing terminal. In graduate school, he had a terminal in his room, where he spent all of his free time programming. Gates happened to attend a private high school with a time-sharing terminal connected to a mainframe in Seattle. He also was able to spend all of his free time programming. Early on, the Beatles were hired to play long shows day after day in Hamburg, Germany. 
Birth year or era is another form of opportunity. Gates and Joy (as well as other early programmers) all reached the end of their teen years just as personal computers became available to the public. In another example, fourteen of the top seventy-five richest people in the history of the world happened to be alive at the same time, in the same country: the United States in the mid-1800s.
Opportunity matters more than an individual’s IQ. Using a study conducted by Lewis Terman, the creator of the Stanford-Binet IQ test, Gladwell shows that “practical intelligence” is as important as “analytical intelligence.” He also contrasts Chris Langan, one of the world’s smartest living people, with Robert Oppenheimer. While both had difficulties in college, only Oppenheimer had a successful life, due to his practical intelligence.
The last portion of Part One looks at Joe Flom, a successful lawyer from New York City. While he was born into a poor family to Jewish immigrants (in a time when Jewish immigrants were not treated well), many of the disadvantages in his life were actually benefits and directly contributed to his success.
Part Two investigates cultural legacies. Using flight recorder transcripts from several plane crashes from the last few decades, Gladwell shows that cultural expectations and habits can be a severe hindrance to pilots. Copilots from countries that have a high “Power Distance Index” (those that show the most deference to authority) will often avoid telling pilots that they are making mistakes, even when the mistakes are potentially fatal. After recognizing the dangers of such cultural expectations, commercial aviation has instituted programs to change the way flight crews talk with one another. 
Gladwell next analyzes the disparity in public school math test scores between Eastern and Western countries. He suggests that the cultures in which rice paddy farming is historically important have a stronger work ethic. Using various examples, Gladwell shows that hard work has a greater impact on success in learning mathematics than intelligence. 
The final example is an examination of the KIPP school in the South Bronx and the “achievement gap” between socioeconomic groups. American students from middle-class and affluent households retain more information over summer vacation and are more likely to make additional gains than students from low-income households. The KIPP school uses longer school days and summer programming to eliminate the achievement gap for low-income children. While the work schedule is very rigorous, the school’s students go on to great academic success.
Gladwell demonstrates that if more opportunities were available, there would be far more successful people and the world would be richer for it."
Accustom,"As a huntress and her family’s primary source of survival, nineteen-year-old Feyre stalks the bleak woods, a little farther from home than usual. Her family was once very wealthy, but they now live in poverty. Feyre’s luck turns when she spots a deer. At the same time, an enormous wolf appears out of nowhere. Feyre wonders if the wolf is a faerie in disguise. She hates faeries for all the harm they have done to humans. Feyre decides to use a precious ash arrow, a surefire method to kill a faerie, just in case. She fires the arrow as the wolf attacks the deer, killing the beast. The next evening, a golden beast bursts through the door of her family’s rundown cottage. The beast reveals that the wolf was indeed a faerie named Andras. The beast demands payment for his death under the terms of the Treaty between the human and faerie realms. The beast gives Feyre a choice: he can kill her now, or she can follow him to the faerie realm of Prythian to live out the rest of her days. Feyre chooses to live. 
In Prythian, Feyre learns the golden beast is a High Fae called Tamlin. He is the High Lord of the Spring Court. Tamlin and all the faeries in his court wear permanent masks on their faces due to an affliction called the blight. At first, Feyre is determined to escape Prythian, but she soon becomes accustomed to her new home. She learns about its history and magic and that much of what she was raised to believe about faeries, including their inability to lie and their aversion to iron, are myths. Feyre develops an affection for Alis, her lady-in-waiting, and Lucien, Tamlin’s best friend. Tamlin encourages her to explore her love for painting and to improve her reading skills. He reveals that he has ensured her family is well cared for in the human realm. Romantic and sexual tension grows between them. Although Feyre finds Prythian beautiful, it is full of dangerous creatures and intrigue. The blight makes life in Prythian increasingly perilous. After a threatening visit from a High Fae named Rhysand, Tamlin believes Feyre is no longer safe in Prythian and decides to send her back to the human realm. The night before she leaves, they make love. Tamlin tells Feyre that he loves her. Though she loves him too, she cannot bring herself to speak the words aloud.  
Feyre returns to the human realm to find that Tamlin was true to his word. Her family is extremely wealthy and well cared for. Her father and sisters have been glamoured, or tricked with faerie magic, and know nothing about faeries or how their wealth was restored. They believe Feyre has been away caring for a sick aunt. Soon, her sister Nesta reveals the glamour did not work on her. After Feyre was taken to Prythian, Nesta searched for her but was unable to cross the wall between the human and faerie realms. Nesta also reveals she is still angry at their father for not trying harder to save their mother’s life. Nesta’s words inspire Feyre to fight harder for Tamlin and she sets off for Prythian to fight the blight alongside him.  
When Feyre arrives at the Spring Court, Tamlin’s manor house is in shambles. Alis is the only one left. Alis reveals that the blight is a euphemism that refers to Amarantha, the High Queen of Prythian. Amarantha is an interloper who took Prythian over by force. She stole the powers of the High Fae and placed a curse on Tamlin that could only be broken by a woman who hated the fae declaring her love for him. Since Feyre never told Tamlin she loved him, the curse remained. The curse prevented the faeries from telling Feyre the truth, so they used the blight to explain their masks and other conflicts. Alis can tell Feyre this because Amarantha has relaxed part of the curse, believing she’s already won, but there is still one aspect of the curse Alis cannot reveal. When Alis explains that Tamlin and Lucien are Amarantha’s captives, Feyre decides to go after them. 
Feyre journeys to Amarantha’s faerie court Under the Mountain, where she becomes a captive as well. Amarantha gives her the chance to save Tamlin by completing three tasks or by solving a riddle. For the first task, Feyre uses her hunting skills to escape a giant worm in a labyrinth. As the faeries place bets and watch in amusement, the only one to bet on Feyre is Rhysand. After, he heals her broken arm. In exchange, Feyre agrees to spend a week every month with him in the Night Court. For the second task, Feyre must successfully solve a puzzle and choose the right lever or she and Lucien will be impaled and crushed. She makes the correct choice with the aid of Rhysand’s voice in her head. In the meantime, Rhysand parades Feyre around as his escort at parties. 
For the third task, Feyre must stab three faeries in the heart with ash wood daggers. Despite her guilt, she knows it’s the only way to break the curse. She stabs the first two faeries, but when the hood is removed from the third one, it is Tamlin. At first, Feyre believes she must kill the man she loves until she remembers two conversations about Tamlin’s heart of stone. She believes this means Tamlin’s heart is literally made of stone so he cannot be harmed by the dagger. Knowing Amarantha wants Tamlin for herself and doesn’t want to see him killed, Feyre plunges the dagger into Tamlin’s chest. She is correct, but Amarantha refuses to break the curse based on a technicality. In a rage, Amarantha beats Feyre almost to death. Feyre finally realizes the answer to Amarantha’s riddle is the word love. She speaks the solution aloud and the curse breaks just as Feyre dies. With the curse broken, Tamlin and Rhysand join forces to destroy Amarantha. One by one, the six High Lords gift Feyre with healing light and immortality. Tamlin sets a bit of this golden light on her heart, resurrecting Feyre and transforming her into one of the High Fae. Feyre and Tamlin are finally free, but Feyre must reckon with her new life and the lives she took to bring them to this point."
Dakotas,"Herbert Clutter inspects his ranch on the morning of November 14, 1959. That same morning, on the other side of Kansas, Perry Smith meets up with Dick Hickock. While the Clutters go about their daily business, running errands and baking cherry pies, Hickock and Smith are tuning their car. After a long drive, they pull up to the Clutter home with a shotgun and knife in hand.
That morning, the bodies are discovered by Susan Kidwell and another of Nancy's friends. Initially, the police are baffled. Bobby Rupp is a suspect until he passes a lie detector test. Alvin Dewey, the KBI agent in charge of the investigation, thinks that the killer must be someone close to the family. Rumor sets the small town of Holcomb on fire. Hartman's Cafe is the center of numerous theories.
Meanwhile, Perry and Dick have returned to Dick's hometown of Olathe. Dick passes some hot checks, and the two flee to Mexico. Perry has always dreamed of finding sunken treasure in Mexico. While the investigation in Kansas begins to methodically follow up dead end leads, Perry and Dick spend some time entertaining a rich German tourist before they run out of money in Mexico City. While packing to return to the states, Perry goes through his personal belongings and remembers his childhood. His mother and father rode the rodeo circuit until they had a falling out. Perry was passed from home to home as a child. Now, two of his three siblings have killed themselves.
The investigation of the Clutter murders seems to be heading nowhere. However, a man in the Kansas state prison at Lansing, Floyd Wells, hears of the murder case. Sure that Dick Hickock is responsible, he begins to think of talking to the authorities. Meanwhile, Dick and Perry are hitchhiking in the American desert. They try to steal a car, but fail. By this time, Floyd has confessed, and Dewey and his team are beginning an elaborate manhunt.
Before they are caught, Dick and Perry steal a car, return to Kansas City, pass more hot checks, and take up residence in Miami. They eventually backtrack to Las Vegas, where a policewoman recognizes their license plate number. Dick confesses after intense questioning, and Perry follows suit. The trial goes smoothly, and the two are condemned to death.
During a five-year appeals process, Dick and Perry languish in Death Row. Perry tries to starve himself while Dick writes letters to various appeals organization. They are kept company by various appalling criminals. When death comes, Dick is awkward and Perry is remorseful."
As,"A Raisin in the Sun portrays a few weeks in the life of the Youngers, a Black family living on the South Side of Chicago in the 1950s. When the play opens, the Youngers are about to receive an insurance check for $10,000. This money comes from the deceased Mr. Younger’s life insurance policy. Each of the adult members of the family has an idea as to what he or she would like to do with this money. The matriarch of the family, Mama, wants to buy a house to fulfill a dream she shared with her husband. Mama’s son, Walter Lee, would rather use the money to invest in a liquor store with his friends. He believes that the investment will solve the family’s financial problems forever. Walter’s wife, Ruth, agrees with Mama, however, and hopes that she and Walter can provide more space and opportunity for their son, Travis. Finally, Beneatha, Walter’s sister and Mama’s daughter, wants to use the money for her medical school tuition. She also wishes that her family members were not so interested in assimilating into the white world. Beneatha instead tries to find her identity by looking back to the past and to Africa.
As the play progresses, the Youngers clash over their competing dreams. Ruth discovers that she is pregnant but fears that if she has the child, she will put more financial pressure on her family members. When Walter says nothing to Ruth’s admission that she is considering abortion, Mama puts a down payment on a house for the whole family. She believes that a bigger, brighter dwelling will help them all. This house is in Clybourne Park, an entirely white neighborhood. When the Youngers’ future neighbors find out that the Youngers are moving in, they send Mr. Lindner, from the Clybourne Park Improvement Association, to offer the Youngers money in return for staying away. The Youngers refuse the deal, even after Walter loses the rest of the money ($6,500) to his friend Willy Harris, who persuades Walter to invest in the liquor store and then runs off with his cash.
In the meantime, Beneatha rejects her suitor, George Murchison, whom she believes to be shallow and blind to the problems of race. Subsequently, she receives a marriage proposal from her Nigerian boyfriend, Joseph Asagai, who wants Beneatha to get a medical degree and move to Africa with him (Beneatha does not make her choice before the end of the play). The Youngers eventually move out of the apartment, fulfilling the family’s long-held dream. Their future seems uncertain and slightly dangerous, but they are optimistic and determined to live a better life. They believe that they can succeed if they stick together as a family and resolve to defer their dreams no longer."
Dictates,"The body of Chase Andrews is found by two boys next to an abandoned fire tower in the swamp on October 30, 1969.
In 1952, six-year-old Kya watches her mother leave their shack in the marsh. Before long, her siblings, including her beloved 12-year-old brother Jodie, depart too, leaving Kya alone with Pa, a drunken, disabled World War II vet prone to violent rages. Pa gives Kya a dollar a week for food. In town, older boys, including Chase Andrews, pass her on their bikes. Kya spends most of her time in the marsh with the gulls.
Mrs. Culpepper, a truant officer, takes Kya to school, where she is humiliated and never returns. Over the years, townspeople call her “dirty,” “the Marsh Girl,” “Missing Link,” and “marsh trash.”
Kya takes Pa’s fishing boat exploring. When she gets lost, one of Jodie’s friends, Tate Walker, guides her back to her channel. Tate lives alone in town with his dad, Scupper, a fisherman. 
For a while, Kya and Pa fish together and enjoy each other’s company. Pa introduces Kya to Jumpin’, an older Black man who sells gas and supplies. Kya’s mother sends a letter, but Pa burns it and returns to drinking. Pa finally disappears when Kya is ten years old. Kya supports herself selling mussels to Jumpin’, whose wife Mabel collects clothes for Kya from Colored Town. Kya continues watching Tate as well as Chase and his friends.
When she is 14 years old, Kya finds a series of special feathers left in a tree stump in the marsh. One day, she leaves a special feather in return. After that, Tate appears at the stump and offers to teach her to read. Tate and Kya begin to meet at a secret cabin in the marsh where he teaches her to read. As Kya matures, Tate brings her a biology textbook and Mabel gives her a bra. One day Tate finds Kya sick on Point Beach. He explains to her that she is having her period. Kya and Tate continue their lessons and she invites him inside her shack and shows him her collection of natural objects. One day, Tate kisses Kya and they begin a romantic relationship. Their desire grows but they avoid having sex. Tate leaves early for college and tells Kya he will visit on the 4th of July. However, he doesn’t return. Kya, devastated, returns to studying nature.
When Kya is 19 years old, Chase catches her eye on Point Beach. He is a popular, good looking, confident, former high school quarterback. Chase approaches Kya on Jumpin’s wharf and invites her on a picnic. 
At the picnic, Chase gives Kya a rare scallop shell. He is sexually aggressive and she runs away. When Kya and Chase meet ten days later, he apologizes and takes her to see the abandoned fire tower. Kya gives Chase a necklace made from the scallop shell. Chase says he won’t approach her sexually unless she wants him to.
Kya gets closer to Chase. Tate, who is home from college, wants to apologize to Kya, but sees her kissing Chase and turns away. Chase starts talking about marriage and invites Kya on an overnight trip. She joins him and they have unsatisfying sex in a cheap motel room. Still, their relationship continues. However, Chase won’t introduce Kya to his parents or friends and disappears for a week over Christmas. 
Tate comes to the lagoon to warn Kya that Chase is seeing other women, but she throws rocks at him. Still, she invites him into the shack and he offers to find a publisher for a book of her nature paintings. 
Kya sees the engagement announcement in the newspaper for Chase and Pearl, a girl she recognizes from Point Beach. She recites poems by Amanda Hamilton, who publishes in the local newspaper, to soothe herself. She determines to live her life alone.
A year later, Kya receives a copy of her first book. She uses the advance money to improve and modernize the shack. She gives Tate a copy of her book. 
Kya’s brother Jodie visits the shack. He tells her that Ma has died and promises to keep in touch. He encourages her to reconcile with Tate.
In August of 1969, Chase sneaks up on Kya on a remote beach, attacks and tries to rape her. She fights him off and sees two fishermen watching from their boat as she leaves. Tate and Jumpin’ see her bruises, but she begs them not to tell anyone. Chase continues to come to her shack, but she hides from him. Kya gets a letter from her publisher, Robert Foster, to meet him in Greenville. She finds out from Tate how to buy a bus ticket and goes to meet him on October 28, returning on October 30, the day Chase’s body is found.
Sheriff Ed Jackson and his deputy Joe Perdue investigate Chase’s death. No footprints or fingerprints are found at the scene. They think Chase was pushed through an open gate and the murderer covered up the scene. Almost immediately, everyone in town suspects “the Marsh Girl.” 
Over time, Joe and Ed’s main clue consists of red wool fibers on Chase’s jacket. Also, Chase’s mother Patti Love tells them Chase was wearing the shell necklace when he left her house that night, but it was not found at the scene. A shrimper, Hal Miller, tells them he saw Kya’s boat headed toward the fire tower the night Chase died. However, Tate and Jumpin’ and townspeople who saw her get on and off the bus to Greenville give Kya an alibi. A fisherman, Rodney Horn, who heard Kya yelling and saw her leaving after Chase attacked her, heard her say she would kill Chase if he bothered her again. Joe and Ed find a red wool hat in Kya’s shack that Tate gave her and that matches the fibers on Chase’s coat. With this information, they arrest Kya for murder.
Kya spends two months in jail awaiting trial. A lawyer, Tom Milton, volunteers to defend her. 
A kind guard at the prison, Jacob, lets the cat, Sunday Justice, into her cell for company. Tate, Jumpin’, and Mabel sit behind Kya in court for support. They are later joined by Jodie, Robert Foster, and Scupper. 
Prosecutor Eric Chastain calls his witnesses and Tom Milton counters their testimony. The jury learns that it would have been possible for Kya to take buses back and forth from Greenville on the night of the murder, but the timing is very tight. Tom calls defense witnesses, including Kya’s publisher Robert Foster. After closing statements, everyone awaits the verdict. Kya is found not guilty. Jodie takes her home, where she is delighted to see the marsh again. 
Kya sees Tate in his boat and is going to approach him, but the sheriff and two deputies arrive and take Tate with them. She learns that Scupper has had a stroke and died.
The day after Scupper’s funeral, Tate finds a feather in his boat from Kya. At the shack, they express their love for each other and Tate moves in with her. Over the years, Jumpin’ dies, and Jodie and his wife and children visit the shack. Tate works at the nearby lab and Kya writes seven more books. 
One day Tate finds Kya in her boat, dead of a heart attack at age 64. On her tombstone, he inscribes “The Marsh Girl.” Many townspeople come to Kya’s funeral on her land. That night, Tate finds two items beneath the floorboards. One is a box of poems by Amanda Hamilton, a pseudonym Kya used, including a poem describing Chase Andrews’ death. Tate also finds the shell necklace Kya gave Chase. Tate burns the poems and rawhide cord and crushes the shell on the beach for the tide to take away."
Abolishing,"Frederick Douglass was born into slavery sometime in 1817 or 1818. Like many enslaved people, he is unsure of his exact date of birth. Douglass is separated from his mother, Harriet Bailey, soon after he is born. His father is most likely their white master, Captain Anthony. Captain Anthony is the clerk of a rich man named Colonel Lloyd. Lloyd enslaves hundreds of men, women, and children, who call his large, central plantation the “Great House Farm.” Life on any of Lloyd’s plantations, like that on many Southern plantations, is brutal. Those enslaved are overworked and exhausted, receive little food, few articles of clothing, and no beds. Those who break rules—and even those who do not—are beaten or whipped, and sometimes even shot by the plantation overseers, the cruelest of which are Mr. Severe and Mr. Austin Gore. 
Douglass’s life on this plantation is not as hard as that of most of the others. Being a child, he serves in the household instead of in the fields. At the age of seven, he is given to Captain Anthony’s son‑in‑law’s brother, Hugh Auld, who lives in Baltimore. In Baltimore, Douglass enjoys a relatively freer life. In general, city slave-owners are more conscious of appearing cruel or neglectful toward those they enslave in front of their non‑slaveowning neighbors.
Sophia Auld, Hugh’s wife, has never ""owned"" enslaved people before, and therefore she is surprisingly kind to Douglass at first. She even begins to teach Douglass to read, until her husband orders her to stop, saying that education makes enslaved people unmanageable. Eventually, Sophia succumbs to the mentality of slaveowning and loses her natural kindliness. Though Sophia and Hugh Auld become crueler toward him, Douglass still likes Baltimore and is able to teach himself to read with the help of local boys. As he learns to read and write, Douglass becomes conscious of the evils of slavery and of the existence of the abolitionist, or antislavery, movement. He resolves to escape to the North eventually.
After the deaths of Captain Anthony and his remaining heirs, Douglass is taken back to serve Thomas Auld, Captain Anthony’s son‑in‑law. Auld is a mean man made harsher by his false religious piety. Auld considers Douglass unmanageable, so Auld rents him for one year to Edward Covey, a man known for “breaking” enslaved people. Covey manages, in the first six months, to work and whip all the spirit out of Douglass. Douglass becomes a brutish man, no longer interested in reading or freedom, capable only of resting from his injuries and exhaustion. The turning point comes when Douglass resolves to fight back against Covey. The two men have a two‑hour fight, after which Covey never touches Douglass again.
His year with Covey over, Douglass is next rented to William Freeland for two years. Though Freeland is a milder, fairer man, Douglass’s will to escape is nonetheless renewed. At Freeland’s, Douglass begins educating his fellow enslaved people in a Sabbath school at the homes of free Black people. Despite the threat of punishment and violence they face, many enslaved people from neighboring farms come to Douglass and work diligently to learn. At Freeland’s, Douglass also forms a plan of escape with three fellow enslaved men with whom he is close. Someone betrays their plan to Freeland, however, and Douglass and the others are taken to jail. Thomas Auld then sends Douglass back to Baltimore with Hugh Auld, to learn the trade of ship caulking.
In Baltimore’s trade industry, Douglass runs up against strained race relations. White workers have been working alongside free Black workers, but the whites have begun to fear that the increasing numbers of free Black people will take their jobs. Though only an apprentice and still enslaved, Douglass encounters violent tactics of intimidation from his white coworkers and is forced to switch shipyards. In his new apprenticeship, Douglass quickly learns the trade of caulking and soon earns the highest wages possible, always turning them over to Hugh Auld.
Eventually, Douglass receives permission from Hugh Auld to hire out his extra time. He saves money bit by bit and eventually makes his escape to New York. Douglass refrains from describing the details of his escape in order to protect the safety of future slaves who may attempt the journey. In New York, Douglass fears recapture and changes his name from Bailey to Douglass. Soon after, he marries Anna Murray, a free woman he met while in Baltimore. They move north to Massachusetts, where Douglass becomes deeply engaged with the abolitionist movement as both a writer and an orator."
Effective,"In a series of letters, Robert Walton, the captain of a ship bound for the North Pole, recounts to his sister back in England the progress of his dangerous mission. Successful early on, the mission is soon interrupted by seas full of impassable ice. Trapped, Walton encounters Victor Frankenstein, who has been traveling by dog-drawn sledge across the ice and is weakened by the cold. Walton takes him aboard ship, helps nurse him back to health, and hears the fantastic tale of the monster that Frankenstein created.
Victor first describes his early life in Geneva. At the end of a blissful childhood spent in the company of Elizabeth Lavenza (his cousin in the 1818 edition, his adopted sister in the 1831 edition) and friend Henry Clerval, Victor enters the university of Ingolstadt to study natural philosophy and chemistry. There, he is consumed by the desire to discover the secret of life and, after several years of research, becomes convinced that he has found it.
Armed with the knowledge he has long been seeking, Victor spends months feverishly fashioning a creature out of old body parts. One climactic night, in the secrecy of his apartment, he brings his creation to life. When he looks at the monstrosity that he has created, however, the sight horrifies him. After a fitful night of sleep, interrupted by the specter of the monster looming over him, he runs into the streets, eventually wandering in remorse. Victor runs into Henry, who has come to study at the university, and he takes his friend back to his apartment. Though the monster is gone, Victor falls into a feverish illness.
Sickened by his horrific deed, Victor prepares to return to Geneva, to his family, and to health. Just before departing Ingolstadt, however, he receives a letter from his father informing him that his youngest brother, William, has been murdered. Grief-stricken, Victor hurries home. While passing through the woods where William was strangled, he catches sight of the monster and becomes convinced that the monster is his brother’s murderer. Arriving in Geneva, Victor finds that Justine Moritz, a kind, gentle girl who had been adopted by the Frankenstein household, has been accused. She is tried, condemned, and executed, despite her assertions of innocence. Victor grows despondent, guilty with the knowledge that the monster he has created bears responsibility for the death of two innocent loved ones.
Hoping to ease his grief, Victor takes a vacation to the mountains. While he is alone one day, crossing an enormous glacier, the monster approaches him. The monster admits to the murder of William but begs for understanding. Lonely, shunned, and forlorn, he says that he struck out at William in a desperate attempt to injure Victor, his cruel creator. The monster begs Victor to create a mate for him, a monster equally grotesque to serve as his sole companion.
Victor refuses at first, horrified by the prospect of creating a second monster. The monster is eloquent and persuasive, however, and he eventually convinces Victor. After returning to Geneva, Victor heads for England, accompanied by Henry, to gather information for the creation of a female monster. Leaving Henry in Scotland, he secludes himself on a desolate island in the Orkneys and works reluctantly at repeating his first success. One night, struck by doubts about the morality of his actions, Victor glances out the window to see the monster glaring in at him with a frightening grin. Horrified by the possible consequences of his work, Victor destroys his new creation. The monster, enraged, vows revenge, swearing that he will be with Victor on Victor’s wedding night.
Later that night, Victor takes a boat out onto a lake and dumps the remains of the second creature in the water. The wind picks up and prevents him from returning to the island. In the morning, he finds himself ashore near an unknown town. Upon landing, he is arrested and informed that he will be tried for a murder discovered the previous night. Victor denies any knowledge of the murder, but when shown the body, he is shocked to behold his friend Henry Clerval, with the mark of the monster’s fingers on his neck. Victor falls ill, raving and feverish, and is kept in prison until his recovery, after which he is acquitted of the crime.
Shortly after returning to Geneva with his father, Victor marries Elizabeth. He fears the monster’s warning and suspects that he will be murdered on his wedding night. To be cautious, he sends Elizabeth away to wait for him. While he awaits the monster, he hears Elizabeth scream and realizes that the monster had been hinting at killing his new bride, not himself. Victor returns home to his father, who dies of grief a short time later. Victor vows to devote the rest of his life to finding the monster and exacting his revenge, and he soon departs to begin his quest.
Victor tracks the monster ever northward into the ice. In a dogsled chase, Victor almost catches up with the monster, but the sea beneath them swells and the ice breaks, leaving an unbridgeable gap between them. At this point, Walton encounters Victor, and the narrative catches up to the time of Walton’s fourth letter to his sister.
Walton tells the remainder of the story in another series of letters to his sister. Victor, already ill when the two men meet, worsens and dies shortly thereafter. When Walton returns, several days later, to the room in which the body lies, he is startled to see the monster weeping over Victor. The monster tells Walton of his immense solitude, suffering, hatred, and remorse. He asserts that now that his creator has died, he too can end his suffering. The monster then departs for the northernmost ice to die."
Treaty,"Nine years after the start of the Trojan War, the Greek (“Achaean”) army sacks Chryse, a town allied with Troy. During the battle, the Achaeans capture a pair of beautiful maidens, Chryseis and Briseis. Agamemnon, the leader of the Achaean forces, takes Chryseis as his prize, and Achilles, the Achaeans’ greatest warrior, claims Briseis. Chryseis’s father, Chryses, who serves as a priest of the god Apollo, offers an enormous ransom in return for his daughter, but Agamemnon refuses to give Chryseis back. Chryses then prays to Apollo, who sends a plague upon the Achaean camp.
After many Achaeans die, Agamemnon consults the prophet Calchas to determine the cause of the plague. When he learns that Chryseis is the cause, he reluctantly gives her up but then demands Briseis from Achilles as compensation. Furious at this insult, Achilles returns to his tent in the army camp and refuses to fight in the war any longer. He vengefully yearns to see the Achaeans destroyed and asks his mother, the sea-nymph Thetis, to enlist the services of Zeus, king of the gods, toward this end. The Trojan and Achaean sides have declared a cease-fire with each other, but now the Trojans breach the treaty and Zeus comes to their aid.
With Zeus supporting the Trojans and Achilles refusing to fight, the Achaeans suffer great losses. Several days of fierce conflict ensue, including duels between Paris and Menelaus and between Hector and Ajax. The Achaeans make no progress; even the heroism of the great Achaean warrior Diomedes proves fruitless. The Trojans push the Achaeans back, forcing them to take refuge behind the ramparts that protect their ships. The Achaeans begin to nurture some hope for the future when a nighttime reconnaissance mission by Diomedes and Odysseus yields information about the Trojans’ plans, but the next day brings disaster. Several Achaean commanders become wounded, and the Trojans break through the Achaean ramparts. They advance all the way up to the boundary of the Achaean camp and set fire to one of the ships. Defeat seems imminent, because without the ships, the army will be stranded at Troy and almost certainly destroyed.
Concerned for his comrades but still too proud to help them himself, Achilles agrees to a plan proposed by Nestor that will allow his beloved friend Patroclus to take his place in battle, wearing his armor. Patroclus is a fine warrior, and his presence on the battlefield helps the Achaeans push the Trojans away from the ships and back to the city walls. But the counterattack soon falters. Apollo knocks Patroclus’s armor to the ground, and Hector slays him. Fighting then breaks out as both sides try to lay claim to the body and armor. Hector ends up with the armor, but the Achaeans, thanks to a courageous effort by Menelaus and others, manage to bring the body back to their camp. When Achilles discovers that Hector has killed Patroclus, he fills with such grief and rage that he agrees to reconcile with Agamemnon and rejoin the battle. Thetis goes to Mount Olympus and persuades the god Hephaestus to forge Achilles a new suit of armor, which she presents to him the next morning. Achilles then rides out to battle at the head of the Achaean army.
Meanwhile, Hector, not expecting Achilles to rejoin the battle, has ordered his men to camp outside the walls of Troy. But when the Trojan army glimpses Achilles, it flees in terror back behind the city walls. Achilles cuts down every Trojan he sees. Strengthened by his rage, he even fights the god of the river Xanthus, who is angered that Achilles has caused so many corpses to fall into his streams. Finally, Achilles confronts Hector outside the walls of Troy. Ashamed at the poor advice that he gave his comrades, Hector refuses to flee inside the city with them. Achilles chases him around the city’s periphery three times, but the goddess Athena finally tricks Hector into turning around and fighting Achilles. In a dramatic duel, Achilles kills Hector. He then lashes the body to the back of his chariot and drags it across the battlefield to the Achaean camp. Upon Achilles’ arrival, the triumphant Achaeans celebrate Patroclus’s funeral with a long series of athletic games in his honor. Each day for the next nine days, Achilles drags Hector’s body in circles around Patroclus’s funeral bier.
At last, the gods agree that Hector deserves a proper burial. Zeus sends the god Hermes to escort King Priam, Hector’s father and the ruler of Troy, into the Achaean camp. Priam tearfully pleads with Achilles to take pity on a father bereft of his son and return Hector’s body. He invokes the memory of Achilles’ own father, Peleus. Deeply moved, Achilles finally relents and returns Hector’s corpse to the Trojans. Both sides agree to a temporary truce, and Hector receives a hero’s funeral."
It,"The novel begins where It Ends with Us left off, after the novel’s protagonists Lily Kincaid and Atlas Corrigan run into each other on the street, and Lily tells Atlas she and Ryle are now divorced. Told in chapters that alternate between Atlas’s and Lily’s perspectives, the novel begins with Atlas nervously hoping Lily will text him soon like she said she would. This hope keeps him uplifted as he handles the reality that someone broke into his restaurant, Bib’s, and vandalized it with a misspelled profanity. Meanwhile, Lily is incredibly busy at Lily Bloom’s, her flower shop, and is confused about what to do about Atlas, knowing a romance with Atlas will infuriate her jealous and abusive ex-husband, Ryle, with whom she shares jointed custody of their infant daughter Emerson.   
Atlas visits the flower shop wanting to talk to Lily and ask her if they can speak on the phone that evening. Ryle comes in unexpectedly, and a panicked Lily hides Atlas in the office supply closet. Lily and Atlas do talk on FaceTime that evening, catching up on each other’s lives, flirting, and testing the waters of their relationship. Hearing that Ryle responded in rage after reading Lily’s teenage journals about Atlas, Atlas asks Lily to read to him from the journals. 
On their first date, Lily gifts Atlas one of her journals. Exhausted after staying up all night with a sick Emerson, Lily falls asleep during the ride to the restaurant. Atlas lets Lily sleep, content to read her journal, reliving their first kiss. Inspired, Atlas writes Lily a letter about his life before her. Atlas recounts how his mother rejected and abused him as a teenager, choosing herself and her abusive husband Tim over Atlas. He says that Lily changed his life and taught him what love was. When Lily wakes up, she reads Atlas’s letter and is moved by it. They want to kiss goodnight but decide to continue taking it slow. 
After his date with Lily, Atlas encounters his mother, Sutton, who is at his restaurant to ask Atlas if he knows where his twelve-year-old brother Josh is. Atlas tells Sutton he didn’t know Josh existed until their conversation. Atlas realizes that Josh is likely the vandal targeting his restaurants. As Atlas deals with Sutton, Lily returns from their date to an angry Ryle, who has just watched Finding Nemo for the first time. Ryle is furious that his daughter’s middle name, Dory, is associated with Atlas, as he is aware that Lily and Atlas often talked about Dory as teenagers. Ryle’s rage-fueled confrontation shakes Lily, and after getting away from Atlas, she is comforted when Marshall, Ryle’s best friend and brother-in-law, tells her she was right to leave Ryle. After their respective rough nights, Atlas drives to Lily’s house to give her a hug. Afterward, Atlas stakes out Bib’s and reads Lily’s journal entry about the first time he and Lily made love, after which Lily’s father almost beat him to death. Atlas catches Josh attempting to vandalize his restaurant. He convinces Josh to come stay with him. Atlas doesn’t want Josh to return to live with Sutton, who he feels is still abusive and only cares about herself. The following day, Sutton demands that Atlas bring Josh to her, and when he does, Atlas sees Sutton strike Josh. He immediately gets Josh back in the car and then takes him to the hospital, vowing to fight for custody.  
Lily invites Atlas to be her date for her coworker Lucy’s wedding. While Lily is getting ready, Atlas sees Lily’s collarbone, the spot where Ryle once bit Lily, and notices the heart tattoo that Lily got as a teenager. Atlas feels upset upon realizing Ryle bit Lily’s collarbone out of jealousy. Lily realizes Atlas’s anger is protective, and she isn’t afraid of him. Atlas and Lily kiss. After making a brief appearance at Lucy’s wedding, they return to Lily’s and make love for the first time since they were teenagers. Afterward, they talk about Atlas fighting for custody of Josh and about the aftermath of Lily’s father’s violent outburst the last time they made love. Atlas returns home to Josh.  
The next morning, Lily is woken to the sound of Ryle pounding her door. Ryle notices evidence of the previous evening and quickly figures out that Lily was with Atlas. He flies into a rage, pinning her to the wall by her throat. Lily, afraid that he’s going to come for Emerson, tells her mother, who watched Emerson the previous night, to take her to a park. Unsure where to go after she picks Emerson up, Lily takes Emerson to Atlas’s and hides out. Josh is working on a homework assignment about his family tree that he struggles to finish because he doesn’t know his family. Atlas thinks if he and Lily were together, he’d raise Emerson as his own daughter. 
Lily wakes up the next morning to a series of angry, threatening texts from Ryle, who also comes to the flower shop to try to make nice after his drunken, menacing texts. Lily tells Ryle she’s sent the messages to her lawyer. Ryle leaves in a rage, and Lily warns Atlas that Ryle may be coming for him, and before Atlas hangs up, Ryle is there. Ryle punches Atlas, blaming him for his problems with Lily. Atlas nonconfrontationally points out to Ryle that his marriage ended because of his temper. Atlas tries to convince Ryle that they need to be a team, since Emerson is impacted by all of their behavior. Ryle leaves, somewhat less angry. Atlas tells Lily about the conversation, and she is pleased that he diffused the situation with words and not violence. 
Atlas and Lily are having a peaceful morning together when Sutton arrives at Atlas’s, demanding Josh back. Josh returns from Theo’s and is afraid of his mother. He insists he wants to live with his father, Tim. Sutton leaves and Lily connects with Josh while Atlas calms down. Atlas takes Josh to see his father in Vermont. Josh realizes he wants to stay with Atlas and says his family tree can be a seedling with two branches—one for him and one for Atlas. Later, Allysa, Marshall, and Lily confront Ryle, telling him that he needs to go to anger management and that he’ll only have supervised visits with Emerson and Rylee until further notice. Ryle is upset but agrees to get help. Meanwhile, Atlas tells Sutton that he wants custody of Josh but encourages her to meet them once a week for dinner, so she can still have a relationship with both her sons. Six months after they began dating, Atlas and Lily move in together. A few years later, they get married. In his vows, Atlas says that no matter what happens, he’s grateful to have gotten to love Lily and even to have her break his heart. He is hopeful for the future."
Octavius,"The novel begins in prison, with the novel’s protagonist and narrator Oliver Marks handcuffed to a table and talking to Joseph Colborne, the detective who was formerly assigned to his case. Colborne congratulates Oliver on being granted parole after serving a ten-year sentence for the murder of his classmate, Richard Stirling, and asks him to share what actually happened ten years earlier. Oliver agrees and the narrative shifts in time to a period ten years earlier. At the start of each chapter, called “acts” as in a play, the novel returns to the present, where Filippa drives Oliver to Dellecher Classical Conservatory, the prestigious arts school they attended together. Detective Colborne and Oliver walk around the lake, reliving and narrating the events that led to Oliver’s incarceration.
The novel’s main action revolves around  seven fourth-year acting students. Their final year will focus on Shakespeare’s tragedies, and their fall performance is slated to be Julius Caesar. Close friends, they can easily anticipate their roles based on previous castings, even before their auditions: Richard will be Caesar; James will play Brutus; Alexander, Cassius; Oliver will be Octavius; Meredith’s role will be Calpurnia; Wren will play Portia; and Filippa will be in drag, playing multiple male characters. The students are also assigned roles for a Halloween performance of Macbeth. 
In response to pressures of their fourth year, previously close relations between the students quickly devolve. Richard begins abusing his classmates, physically and verbally, during rehearsals for Julius Caesar. His girlfriend, Meredith, and his main competitor, James, are both covered in bruises. Tensions run high as the play is slow to come together and, after the Macbeth performance, a friendly game in the lake turns ugly when Richard holds James under water, nearly drowning him. Meredith breaks up with Richard, and the group decides to teach him a lesson, using a rehearsal to attack their classmate. But despite obstacles, the play finally comes together, and opening night is a success. At the raucous afterparty, Meredith flirts with a cellist and Richard, enraged, attacks him, sending him to the infirmary. Angry, Meredith invites Oliver up to her room, and the two have sex, while an enraged Richard pounds on the door.  
A few hours later, Filippa summons Meredith and Oliver to the lake. There Oliver and Meredith discover a battered, broken and seemingly deceased Richard floating in the water. Richard emits a gurgling sound indicating he’s still alive. Frightened and exhausted of Richard’s abuse, the six collectively decide to let him die in the water, assuming that he injured himself while intoxicated. They craft a narrative of likely events for school administration and the police and feel relief when everyone seems to accept their version of events. But guilt erodes their relations with each other and impacts their behavior. Meredith and Oliver continue dating but struggle to be comfortable together under the watchful eye of Richard’s specter. Alexander indulges even more freely in drugs and alcohol. Wren withdraws into herself while James’s behavior becomes erratic. The only character who seems able to hold things together is Filippa. The Thanksgiving holiday offers little respite from their stress. When Oliver’s holiday plans to visit Meredith in New York are derailed by an unexpected visit from James, Meredith is upset that Oliver chooses James over her, a frequent point of contention. 
The Christmas holidays prove equally tense. Oliver learns that his family cannot afford for him to return to Dellecher and, after fighting with them, flees to New York, spending the break in Meredith’s family apartment. Oliver arranges for financial aid to complete his final year, agreeing to be the custodian for the Dellecher Castle, where the acting students live. The play for the spring is King Lear and, unlike the fall, the casting comes as a surprise. James is assigned the role of Edmund, the play’s main antagonist, while Oliver, usually cast as James’s sidekick, is given the part of Edgar. The two friends are now opponents. Not only do the teachers, Frederick and Camilo, take roles to fill out the mature cast, but James and Meredith also have romantic scenes, a challenge given their mutual dislike. The students will also perform Romeo and Juliet as a masque. 
When the police return and Alexander overdoses, Oliver realizes the group is beginning to crack under the strain of allowing Richard to die. While cleaning the fireplace, Oliver finds a bloody piece of cloth, clearly from Richard’s shirt, and realizes that his death was not the accident they believed it to be. Oliver hides the fabric but feels mounting anxiety. At the same time, rehearsals for King Lear add drama to the students’ lives. Prompted by Gwendolyn, who deplores their lack of connection, James and Meredith kiss passionately. Watching, Oliver realizes he is jealous and comes to understand that he has feelings for James. During another rehearsal, this time for a fight scene, James attacks Oliver, breaking his nose. They limp through the Romeo and Juliet performance, their relationships fragile and tense, although King Lear proves their final undoing. 
The day of the performance, while cleaning, Oliver finds a bloody boat hook hidden in James’s mattress and realizes that he must have used it to hit Richard. Oliver confronts James, who admits that he did hit Richard with it after Richard bullied him and accused him of being in love with Oliver. James also explains that Filippa has known the truth all along and helped him hide the crime. Despite these revelations, Oliver and James manage somehow to finish the play. The detectives and school administration wait in the wings. After the play, Oliver confesses to the crime James committed. Though Detective Colborne is suspicious of his confession, Oliver doesn’t recant it, and after a brief trial, Oliver is charged with second-degree murder. Oliver’s story finished, the novel ends in the present. Colborne wishes him well, and Filippa, who has visited Oliver every two weeks during his time in prison, informs him that James committed suicide years ago. Oliver goes to New York to see Meredith, now a famous actress, and the two resume a relationship. Filippa sends Oliver a note James had left for him, which is a passage from Pericles, Prince of Tyre. The passage is obscure but leaves open the possibility that James, whose body was never found, may still be alive."
Tyranny,"The town in which the play is set has built a huge bathing complex that is crucial to the town's economy. Dr. Stockmann has just discovered that the baths' drainage system is seriously contaminated. He alerts several members of the community, including Hovstad and Aslaksen, and receives generous support and thanks for making his discovery in time to save the town. The next morning, however, his brother, who is also the town's mayor, tells him that he must retract his statements, for the necessary repairs would be too expensive; additionally, the mayor is not convinced by Dr. Stockmann's findings. The brothers have a fierce argument, but Dr. Stockmann hopes that at least Hovstad's newspaper will support him. However, the mayor convinces Hovstad and Aslaksen to oppose Dr. Stockmann.
The doctor holds a town meeting to give a lecture on the baths, but Aslaksen and the mayor try to keep him from speaking. Dr. Stockmann then begins a long tirade in which he condemns the foundations of the town and the tyranny of the majority. The audience finds his speech incredibly offensive, and the next morning the doctor's home is vandalized. He and his daughter are fired. The mayor insinuates that the doctor's actions were merely a scheme to inherit more of Morten Kiil's money, and Kiil himself soon arrives to suggest just such a plan to Dr. Stockmann. However, the doctor refuses all such suggestions and decides to defy authority and remain in town. His family is supportive, and he says that the strongest man is the man who stands alone."
Seizing,"Tommy Wilhelm is a man in his mid-forties, temporarily living in the Hotel Gloriana on the Upper West Side of New York City, the same hotel in which his father has taken residence for a number of years. He is out of place from the beginning, living in a hotel filled with elderly retirees and continuing throughout the novel to be a figure of isolation amidst crowds. The novella traverses one very important day in the life of this self-same Tommy Wilhelm: his ""day of reckoning,"" so to speak.
As the novella opens, Tommy is descending in the hotel elevator, on his way to meet his father for breakfast, as he does every morning. However, this morning feels different to Tommy, he feels a certain degree of fear and of foreboding for something that lies in the hours ahead of him and has been building for quite some time.
The reader begins to discover through Tommy's thoughts and through a series of flashbacks that Tommy has just recently been fired from his job as a salesman, he is a college drop-out, a man with two children, recently separated from his wife, and he is a man on the brink of financial disaster. Tommy has just given over the last of his savings to the fraudulent Dr. Tamkin, who has promised to knowingly invest it in the commodities market. Amid all of this, he has, apparently, fallen in love with a woman named Olive, who he cannot marry because his wife will not grant him a divorce. Tommy is unhappy and in need of assistance both emotionally and financially.
In the first three chapters the reader follows Tommy as he talks with his father, Dr. Adler, who sees his son as a failure in every sense of the word. Tommy is refused financial assistance and also refused any kind of support, emotionally or otherwise, from his father. It is also within these beginning chapters that the flashbacks begin. The flashbacks highlight, among other things, Tommy's meeting with the duplicitous Maurice Venice, the talent scout who shows initial interest in a young Tommy and his good looks. Wilhelm, however, is later rejected by the same scout after a failed screen test but nevertheless attempts a career in Hollywood as an actor. He discontinues his college education and moves to California, against his parent's will and warnings.
The chapters that follow focus on Tommy's encounters and conversations with Dr. Tamkin, a seemingly fraudulent and questionable ""psychologist,"" who gives Tommy endless advice and thus provides the assistance he had looked for from his father. Whether Tamkin is fraudulent and questionable as a psychologist, and whether he is a liar and a charlatan is a question that is constantly being posed to us. Regardless, Tamkin is quite charming and appeals to Tommy. Dr. Tamkin claims to be a poet, a healer, a member of the Detroit Purple Gang, as well as claiming a number of other positions and titles. Despite his lies, he gives Tommy kernels of truth that become significant in the novella and for Tommy. Moreover, Tommy entrusts Tamkin with the last of his savings to invest in the commodities market, since Tamkin claims a certain stock market expertise.
The rest of the novella consists of Tommy and Dr. Tamkin traveling back and forth to and from the stock market, meeting several characters along the way. The novel finally illustrates Tommy's terrible loss in the commodities in which Tamkin has invested Tommy's money. Tommy has lost all of his savings but still has the monetary demands of his family to meet. Furthermore, Tamkin has disappeared. After an attempt to look for Tamkin in his room at the hotel, the novella comes to a close with three climaxes—two minor and one large, final climax.
First, there is the final confrontation with his father in the massage room of the hotel in which Tommy is denied any assistance one last time, as he stands before his naked father. Afterward, Tommy has a loud and almost raving fight with his wife on the telephone in which he claims to be ""suffocating"" and unable to ""breathe."" Full of rage, he exits out onto Broadway where he believes to see Dr. Tamkin at a funeral, nearby. He calls out to Tamkin but receives no reply. Suddenly he is swept in by a rush of people and finds himself carried into a crowd within the chapel where the funeral is taking place. It is here that the final climax comes because Tommy finds himself before the body of a dead stranger, unable to break away and he begins to cry and weep. He releases pools of emotion and ""crie[s] with all his heart."" It is here that the book ends. Other people at the funeral are confused as to who he is, wondering how close he had been to the deceased. The deceased is a stranger but Tommy, however, is left in this ""happy oblivion of tears."""
Content,"Never Let Me Go takes place in a dystopian version of late 1990s England, where the lives of ordinary citizens are prolonged through a state-sanctioned program of human cloning. The clones, referred to as students, grow up in special institutions away from the outside world. As young adults, they begin to donate their vital organs. All “donors” receive care from designated “carers,” clones who have not yet begun the donation process. The clones continue to donate organs until they “complete,” which is a euphemism for death after the donation of three or four organs. However, this premise is not immediately apparent to the reader. At the start of the novel, narrator Kathy H. merely introduces herself as a thirty-one-year-old carer. She has been a carer for nearly twelve years, but will leave her role in a few months. Kathy explains that she wants to revisit her memories of Tommy and Ruth, two friends who grew up with her at the Hailsham school. Kathy does not explain the donation program, or mention that Hailsham students are clones.
Although Kathy’s narration is often nonlinear, the novel’s three parts roughly align with three stages in her life. In Part One, Kathy remembers her childhood at Hailsham. She describes her friendship with Ruth, whose temperamental personality contrasts with her own quiet demeanor. At Hailsham, Ruth often annoys Kathy by pretending to have special knowledge and privileges. Kathy also describes Tommy, a student known for throwing violent temper tantrums. Tommy is initially an outcast among his peers because he lacks artistic ability, which the Hailsham staff (part teacher, part parent figures known as “guardians”), and its students value highly. Kathy sympathizes with Tommy, and tries to calm him down during one of his tantrums. Tommy later learns to control his temper after a guardian named Miss Lucy assures him that it is not necessary for him to be creative.
Although the students learn vaguely about the donation program, their guardians shield them from a full understanding of their future. Miss Lucy disagrees with this indirect approach, and often exhibits strange behavior in front of the students as a result, in one instance telling them explicitly about their futures. After Miss Lucy speaks with Tommy about his artwork, he and Kathy theorize that creativity may be connected to donations. They speculate about Madame, a woman who visits Hailsham to collect the best student artwork. Madame is rumored to keep this art in a personal gallery. Kathy later encounters Madame in the girls’ dormitory, while Kathy dances to the song “Never Let Me Go.” The song is Kathy’s favorite track on Songs After Dark, a Judy Bridgewater album that is one of her most prized possessions. When the song ends, Kathy sees Madame crying in the doorway. Shortly afterwards, Kathy loses her tape. Tommy’s temper returns during their last summer at Hailsham. Kathy thinks he is upset about his recent breakup with Ruth, whom he has dated for six months. But Tommy is upset about Miss Lucy, who recently told him that she was wrong to dismiss the importance of creativity. Miss Lucy departs Hailsham abruptly, and Tommy mends his relationship with Ruth.
In Part Two, Kathy moves with Ruth and Tommy to a transitional housing facility known as the Cottages. They adjust to their new lives, becoming acquainted with the “veteran” students living there already. Ruth often ignores Tommy and Kathy in her efforts to blend in with the veterans, who are not from Hailsham. Kathy notices that the veterans regard the Hailsham students with awe. One couple, Chrissie and Rodney, are especially interested in Hailsham. They convince Ruth to go with them to Norfolk, where Rodney claims to have seen Ruth’s “possible” in an open-plan office (a “possible” is a human that resembles a specific clone and from whom that clone's DNA may have been copied). Kathy is skeptical of Rodney’s story, especially since it features Ruth’s “dream future” of working in an open-plan office. In the end, Kathy, Tommy, Ruth, Rodney, and Chrissie all drive to Norfolk.
In Norfolk, Chrissie and Rodney ask about a rumored exception allowing Hailsham couples in love to defer their donations. Ruth pretends to know something about deferrals, which surprises Kathy and Tommy. The students eventually find the open-plan office. Rodney points to a woman in the window, and they all agree that she could be Ruth’s legitimate possible. They follow her to an art gallery, where they realize that the woman does not actually resemble Ruth. In her disappointment, Ruth says that the students are modeled only on “trash.” Ruth goes off with Chrissie and Rodney. Meanwhile, Tommy and Kathy find a copy of Kathy’s lost tape in a secondhand store. Tommy tells Kathy that he has begun drawing pictures of imaginary animals. He thinks Madame uses the students’ artwork to determine if couples applying for deferrals are truly in love. After Norfolk, Ruth stops talking about her dream future. Tommy shows his drawings to Kathy, who finds them puzzling but captivating. Meanwhile, Kathy’s friendship with Ruth grows increasingly tense. Ruth reveals that she knows Kathy likes Tommy, but says that Tommy will never return Kathy’s feelings. Shortly afterwards, Kathy submits her application for carer training and departs.
Part Three focuses on Kathy’s time as carer. While Kathy is good at her job, the work is both difficult and lonely. She unexpectedly runs into a Hailsham friend named Laura, who is also a carer. They talk about Ruth, who had a bad first donation. They also talk about Hailsham, which has closed. Kathy becomes Ruth’s carer, but their relationship is strained and guarded. One day, Ruth expresses a desire to visit a beached fishing boat near Tommy’s recovery center. They pick up Tommy on the way to the boat, which they find bleached and crumbling in a marsh. The marsh reminds both Tommy and Ruth of Hailsham. They also discuss Chrissie, who completed on her second donation. On the return trip, Ruth apologizes for keeping Tommy and Kathy apart. She encourages them to pursue a deferral, revealing that she has discovered Madame’s home address. In the weeks that follow, Kathy and Ruth reminisce peacefully about Hailsham and the Cottages. Ruth also encourages Kathy to become Tommy’s carer.
Ruth completes after her second donation. Tommy gives his third donation, and Kathy becomes his carer. They spend their days reading and talking at his recovery center. Eventually, they also begin to have sex. Hoping to pursue a deferral, they go to visit Madame at the address Ruth provided. Madame invites them inside and listens to their request, after which Miss Emily appears from the next room. Miss Emily says that deferrals do not exist. She explains that Hailsham was part of a progressive movement committed to raising clones more humanely. Madame used to exhibit the students’ artwork to show the outside world that clones had souls. Although the movement once had many supporters, changing public opinion eventually forced Hailsham to close. On the drive back to his recovery center, Tommy asks Kathy to pull over. He walks into the woods and begins screaming. Kathy goes to Tommy and holds him. Soon after, Tommy gives his fourth donation and completes. Kathy drives to a field in Norfolk, where she allows herself to imagine Tommy on the horizon. Then she drives away."
We,"Cadence, nearly eighteen, narrates her story in the first person. In Part One (“Welcome”), she describes the three generations of her family, the Sinclairs; Granddad, widowed; his three daughters, all divorced or separated from their husbands; and Cadence and her six cousins. The family spends every summer on a family-owned island. One aunt’s longtime boyfriend and his nephew, Gat, always join them there, even though Granddad doesn’t like the fact that they are of South Asian descent. Cadence, her two oldest cousins, and Gat are known in the family as “the Liars,” for unexplained reasons. Cadence and Gat fell in love when Cadence was fourteen, but the next summer there was an accident of some sort. Cadence doesn’t recall much, but apparently she suffered a head injury. She now has migraines, for which she takes prescription pain medication. None of the Liars stayed in touch with Cadence during her long recovery. The following summer, when her father took her on a trip to Europe, they didn’t reply to her emails.
In Part Two (“Vermont”), Cadence struggles to remember more of her accident. When she asks Penny for details, Penny replies tearfully that Cadence has asked many times before, and always finds the answers upsetting. When Cadence’s father wants to take her to Europe again next summer, Cadence insists on returning to the island. Her mother and father reluctantly settle on a plan for her to spend just the first month of the summer there. Meanwhile, it becomes clear during a visit from Granddad and a phone call with one of the younger cousins that all is not well with the family. Granddad’s mind is starting to fail, the younger cousins gossip about Cadence being a drug addict, and the cousin on the phone thinks the island is haunted.
Part Three (“Summer Seventeen”) begins with Cadence’s arrival at the island. To her shock, the old Victorian house where Granddad and Granny used to live has been completely rebuilt, as an unattractive modern structure. She reunites awkwardly with her aunts and the younger cousins, but her reunion with the Liars goes better, despite her resentment over not hearing from them in the last two years. The four Liars agree to stay together and not to spend much time with the rest of the family. Over the next week or two, Cadence begins to remember what happened two summers ago. Granddad and his daughters argued about the family home back in Boston. One aunt was resentful over the condition of her house on the island. Granddad also snapped at Cadence one day, about his right to do with his money as he pleased. In the present, Cadence makes progress reconnecting with the Liars, but they’re not very responsive to her questions about her accident.
In Part Four (“Look, a Fire”), Cadence starts to grasp what really happened. There had been an ugly showdown between Granddad and his daughters, about the division of the family inheritance. The fight ended with all four adults angrily leaving the island for a short time, taking the younger cousins with them. The Liars stayed behind. Since much of the family conflict had been about Granddad’s house and its contents, the Liars had deliberately burned the house down. Cadence is pleased that in the new house, Granddad and his daughters treat each other more kindly. Cadence’s feelings change, however, when she realizes that Granddad’s two dogs died in the fire. She and the other Liars are responsible for their deaths.
In Part Five (“Truth”), finally, Cadence confronts the whole truth: she alone survived the fire. The other three Liars died. They have spent the last few weeks with Cadence as ghosts, waiting for her to remember and understand. Now the Liars must leave. Cadence says final goodbyes to her two cousins and her beloved Gat. She carries with her the guilty knowledge of her role in their deaths. She is resolved to be kinder toward her surviving family from now on."
Text,"Okonkwo is a wealthy and respected warrior of the Umuofia clan, a lower Nigerian tribe that is part of a consortium of nine connected villages. He is haunted by the actions of Unoka, his cowardly and spendthrift father, who died in disrepute, leaving many village debts unsettled. In response, Okonkwo became a clansman, warrior, farmer, and family provider extraordinaire. He has a twelve-year-old son named Nwoye whom he finds lazy; Okonkwo worries that Nwoye will end up a failure like Unoka.
In a settlement with a neighboring tribe, Umuofia wins a virgin and a fifteen-year-old boy. Okonkwo takes charge of the boy, Ikemefuna, and finds an ideal son in him. Nwoye likewise forms a strong attachment to the newcomer. Despite his fondness for Ikemefuna and despite the fact that the boy begins to call him “father,” Okonkwo does not let himself show any affection for him.
During the Week of Peace, Okonkwo accuses his youngest wife, Ojiugo, of negligence. He severely beats her, breaking the peace of the sacred week. He makes some sacrifices to show his repentance, but he has shocked his community irreparably.
Ikemefuna stays with Okonkwo’s family for three years. Nwoye looks up to him as an older brother and, much to Okonkwo’s pleasure, develops a more masculine attitude. One day, the locusts come to Umuofia—they will come every year for seven years before disappearing for another generation. The village excitedly collects them because they are good to eat when cooked.
Ogbuefi Ezeudu, a respected village elder, informs Okonkwo in private that the Oracle has said that Ikemefuna must be killed. He tells Okonkwo that because Ikemefuna calls him “father,” Okonkwo should not take part in the boy’s death. Okonkwo lies to Ikemefuna, telling him that they must return him to his home village. Nwoye bursts into tears.
As he walks with the men of Umuofia, Ikemefuna thinks about seeing his mother. After several hours of walking, some of Okonkwo’s clansmen attack the boy with machetes. Ikemefuna runs to Okonkwo for help. But Okonkwo, who doesn’t wish to look weak in front of his fellow tribesmen, cuts the boy down despite the Oracle’s admonishment. When Okonkwo returns home, Nwoye deduces that his friend is dead.
Okonkwo sinks into a depression, neither able to sleep nor eat. He visits his friend Obierika and begins to feel revived a bit. Okonkwo’s daughter Ezinma falls ill, but she recovers after Okonkwo gathers leaves for her medicine.
The death of Ogbuefi Ezeudu is announced to the surrounding villages by means of the ekwe, a musical instrument. Okonkwo feels guilty because the last time Ezeudu visited him was to warn him against taking part in Ikemefuna’s death. At Ogbuefi Ezeudu’s large and elaborate funeral, the men beat drums and fire their guns. Tragedy compounds upon itself when Okonkwo’s gun explodes and kills Ogbuefi Ezeudu’s sixteen-year-old son.
Because killing a clansman is a crime against the earth goddess, Okonkwo must take his family into exile for seven years in order to atone. He gathers his most valuable belongings and takes his family to his mother’s natal village, Mbanta. The men from Ogbuefi Ezeudu’s quarter burn Okonkwo’s buildings and kill his animals to cleanse the village of his sin.
Okonkwo’s kinsmen, especially his uncle, Uchendu, receive him warmly. They help him build a new compound of huts and lend him yam seeds to start a farm. Although he is bitterly disappointed at his misfortune, Okonkwo reconciles himself to life in his motherland.
During the second year of Okonkwo’s exile, Obierika brings several bags of cowries (shells used as currency) that he has made by selling Okonkwo’s yams. Obierika plans to continue to do so until Okonkwo returns to the village. Obierika also brings the bad news that Abame, another village, has been destroyed by the white man.
Soon afterward, six missionaries travel to Mbanta. Through an interpreter named Mr. Kiaga, the missionaries’ leader, Mr. Brown, speaks to the villagers. He tells them that their gods are false and that worshipping more than one God is idolatrous. But the villagers do not understand how the Holy Trinity can be accepted as one God. Although his aim is to convert the residents of Umuofia to Christianity, Mr. Brown does not allow his followers to antagonize the clan.
Mr. Brown grows ill and is soon replaced by Reverend James Smith, an intolerant and strict man. The more zealous converts are relieved to be free of Mr. Brown’s policy of restraint. One such convert, Enoch, dares to unmask an egwugwu during the annual ceremony to honor the earth deity, an act equivalent to killing an ancestral spirit. The next day, the egwugwu burn Enoch’s compound and Reverend Smith’s church to the ground.
The District Commissioner is upset by the burning of the church and requests that the leaders of Umuofia meet with him. Once they are gathered, however, the leaders are handcuffed and thrown in jail, where they suffer insults and physical abuse.
After the prisoners are released, the clansmen hold a meeting, during which five court messengers approach and order the clansmen to desist. Expecting his fellow clan members to join him in uprising, Okonkwo kills their leader with his machete. When the crowd allows the other messengers to escape, Okonkwo realizes that his clan is not willing to go to war.
When the District Commissioner arrives at Okonkwo’s compound, he finds that Okonkwo has hanged himself. Obierika and his friends lead the commissioner to the body. Obierika explains that suicide is a grave sin; thus, according to custom, none of Okonkwo’s clansmen may touch his body. The commissioner, who is writing a book about Africa, believes that the story of Okonkwo’s rebellion and death will make for an interesting paragraph or two. He has already chosen the book’s title: The Pacification of the Primitive Tribes of the Lower Niger."
Challenging,"Thomas Gradgrind, a wealthy, retired merchant in the industrial city of Coketown, England, devotes his life to a philosophy of rationalism, self-interest, and fact. He raises his oldest children, Louisa and Tom, according to this philosophy and never allows them to engage in fanciful or imaginative pursuits. He founds a school and charitably takes in one of the students, the kindly and imaginative Sissy Jupe, after the disappearance of her father, a circus entertainer.
	As the Gradgrind children grow older, Tom becomes a dissipated, self-interested hedonist, and Louisa struggles with deep inner confusion, feeling as though she is missing something important in her life. Eventually Louisa marries Gradgrind’s friend Josiah Bounderby, a wealthy factory owner and banker more than twice her age. Bounderby continually trumpets his role as a self-made man who was abandoned in the gutter by his mother as an infant. Tom is apprenticed at the Bounderby bank, and Sissy remains at the Gradgrind home to care for the younger children.
	In the meantime, an impoverished “Hand”—Dickens’s term for the lowest laborers in Coketown’s factories—named Stephen Blackpool struggles with his love for Rachael, another poor factory worker. He is unable to marry her because he is already married to a horrible, drunken woman who disappears for months and even years at a time. Stephen visits Bounderby to ask about a divorce but learns that only the wealthy can obtain them. Outside Bounderby’s home, he meets Mrs. Pegler, a strange old woman with an inexplicable devotion to Bounderby.
	James Harthouse, a wealthy young sophisticate from London, arrives in Coketown to begin a political career as a disciple of Gradgrind, who is now a Member of Parliament. He immediately takes an interest in Louisa and decides to try to seduce her. With the unspoken aid of Mrs. Sparsit, a former aristocrat who has fallen on hard times and now works for Bounderby, he sets about trying to corrupt Louisa.
	The Hands, exhorted by a crooked union spokesman named Slackbridge, try to form a union. Only Stephen refuses to join because he feels that a union strike would only increase tensions between employers and employees. He is cast out by the other Hands and fired by Bounderby when he refuses to spy on them. Louisa, impressed with Stephen’s integrity, visits him before he leaves Coketown and helps him with some money. Tom accompanies her and tells Stephen that if he waits outside the bank for several consecutive nights, help will come to him. Stephen does so, but no help arrives. Eventually he packs up and leaves Coketown, hoping to find agricultural work in the country. Not long after that, the bank is robbed, and the lone suspect is Stephen, the vanished Hand who was seen loitering outside the bank for several nights just before disappearing from the city.
	Mrs. Sparsit witnesses Harthouse declaring his love for Louisa, and Louisa agrees to meet him in Coketown later that night. However, Louisa instead flees to her father’s house, where she miserably confides to Gradgrind that her upbringing has left her married to a man she does not love, disconnected from her feelings, deeply unhappy, and possibly in love with Harthouse. She collapses to the floor, and Gradgrind, struck dumb with self-reproach, begins to realize the imperfections in his philosophy of rational self-interest.
	Sissy, who loves Louisa deeply, visits Harthouse and convinces him to leave Coketown forever. Bounderby, furious that his wife has left him, redoubles his efforts to capture Stephen. When Stephen tries to return to clear his good name, he falls into a mining pit called Old Hell Shaft. Rachael and Louisa discover him, but he dies soon after an emotional farewell to Rachael. Gradgrind and Louisa realize that Tom is really responsible for robbing the bank, and they arrange to sneak him out of England with the help of the circus performers with whom Sissy spent her early childhood. They are nearly successful, but are stopped by Bitzer, a young man who went to Gradgrind’s school and who embodies all the qualities of the detached rationalism that Gradgrind once espoused, but who now sees its limits. Sleary, the lisping circus proprietor, arranges for Tom to slip out of Bitzer’s grasp, and the young robber escapes from England after all.
	Mrs. Sparsit, anxious to help Bounderby find the robbers, drags Mrs. Pegler—a known associate of Stephen Blackpool—in to see Bounderby, thinking Mrs. Pegler is a potential witness. Bounderby recoils, and it is revealed that Mrs. Pegler is really his loving mother, whom he has forbidden to visit him: Bounderby is not a self-made man after all. Angrily, Bounderby fires Mrs. Sparsit and sends her away to her hostile relatives. Five years later, he will die alone in the streets of Coketown. Gradgrind gives up his philosophy of fact and devotes his political power to helping the poor. Tom realizes the error of his ways but dies without ever seeing his family again. While Sissy marries and has a large and loving family, Louisa never again marries and never has children. Nevertheless, Louisa is loved by Sissy’s family and learns at last how to feel sympathy for her fellow human beings."
Melancholy,"Werther is a young, educated, middle-class gentleman setting out to earn a living and make his mark on the world. His family expects him to get a job, and his friend, Wilhelm, networks with his contacts to find opportunities in government service. Werther nurtures a desire to be an artist, a pastime that doesn't pay the bills but suits his keen powers of observation and imagination. Werther leaves home in the spring of 1771 and writes letters to Wilhelm over a twenty-month period as he travels.
As Werther intersects with the world, he paints a picture of the monotony of daily existence relieved by the lofty beauty of the natural world. In nature’s vistas, he finds relief from his own introspective, melancholy thoughts. At an estate his family manages, Werther befriends the local townspeople and feels especially drawn to children. The people there lead simple lives, however, and he misses the intellectual stimulation he enjoys from the educated classes. 
After Werther relocates to Walheim, he meets Charlotte, the beautiful daughter of a local district judge. Charlotte’s mother has recently died, leaving behind nine children. On her deathbed, the mother entrusted the children to Charlotte’s care and gave her blessing to Charlotte’s engagement to Albert, a successful businessman. Albert is traveling on business when Werther and Charlotte dance the night away at a ball. Werther finds a kindred spirit in Charlotte and falls madly in love with her. He visits daily and develops a close relationship with Charlotte’s siblings, who enjoy his roughhousing and storytelling. Charlotte doesn’t reconsider her commitment to marrying Albert, and Werther respects the boundaries of their friendship. However, due to Werther’s frustrated longing for a closer relationship and a recognition that he has no future with her, his infatuation with Charlotte slowly becomes an obsession. When Werther begins having suicidal thoughts, he realizes he must break from the vicious cycle.
In the fall, Werther relocates from the country to the court when he takes a position as an attaché to an ambassador. Werther invests himself in his work, but he finds himself at odds with court culture. The emphasis on class rank among the people who surround the count disgusts Werther, who judges the worth of people, whether peasant or noble, based on their accomplishments. Soon, Werther’s promising start in government service begins to unravel. His dismissive criticism of petty social climbing blows back on him. When Werther fails to observe strict class protocols at the count’s home, the resulting ostracism among his friends and associates causes him to resign his commission. A nobleman sponsors Werther with a stipend to stay awhile with him while he considers his future. He counsels Werther against joining the army, and Werther abandons that career path and passes his time improving his drawing skills.
Werther’s melancholic thoughts turn once again to Charlotte, whom he still loves despite the news he received in February of 1772 that Charlotte and Albert married. He returns to Walheim hoping to recapture some of the optimism and energy he felt there. Instead, life’s difficulties press in on him. A child whom he once drew and cared about has died. The beautiful old walnut trees in the square have been cut down. Werther often visits Charlotte, but their platonic relationship drives him increasingly into a suicidal depression. 
Werther’s behavior becomes increasingly unstable. When he mounts a manic defense of a confessed murderer, Albert wants no more to do with him. Albert’s request that Charlotte terminate all contact with Werther forces her to confront her complex feelings for Werther. On December 20, she tells Werther that he may only visit when invited, trying to set boundaries that would allow the friendship she values so much to continue while still showing solidarity with Albert. She invites Werther to join their family’s Christmas Eve celebration, and she assumes he will abide by her wishes. Charlotte tells Albert she has the situation under control, and he leaves on an overnight business trip the next morning.
Werther, however, has already planned to take his life, and he disregards Charlotte’s instructions, arriving unannounced the next evening during Albert’s absence. Charlotte hastily tries to summon friends to join them, but in the meantime, she suggests that he read to her from his translation of Ossian, an epic poem that describes a hero’s death. Charlotte understands that Werther intends to end his life. The tragic events depicted in the poetry create an emotionally charged picture of their doomed love affair, and they exchange a passionate kiss for the first time. Overcome with grief for Werther and horror at her betrayal of Albert, Charlotte locks herself in an adjoining room until Werther leaves.
Werther’s joy at realizing Charlotte does love him only confirms his plan to end his life rather than live without her. He embraces death as a sacrifice for their marriage. Werther calmly wraps up his affairs and writes letters to Wilhelm and Charlotte, and the next day he shoots himself with a pistol he borrowed from Albert. He survives the head wound for twelve hours before succumbing to the brain injury from the bullet entering his skull. Local field hands inter his body in a grave that Werther had specified, unattended by any mourners or clergy."
Explaining,"Two migrant workers, George and Lennie, have been let off a bus miles away from the California farm where they are due to start work. George is a small, dark man with “sharp, strong features.” Lennie, his companion, is his opposite, a giant of a man with a “shapeless” face. Overcome with thirst, the two stop in a clearing by a pool and decide to camp for the night. As the two converse, it becomes clear that Lennie has an intellectual disability, and is deeply devoted to George and dependent upon him for protection and guidance. George finds that Lennie, who loves petting soft things but often accidentally kills them, has been carrying and stroking a dead mouse. George angrily throws it away, fearing that Lennie might catch a disease from the dead animal. George complains loudly that his life would be easier without having to care for Lennie, but the reader senses that their friendship and devotion is mutual. He and Lennie share a dream of buying their own piece of land, farming it, and, much to Lennie’s delight, keeping rabbits. George ends the night by treating Lennie to the story he often tells him about what life will be like in such an idyllic place.
The next day, the men report to the nearby ranch. George, fearing how the boss will react to Lennie, insists that he’ll do all the talking. He lies, explaining that they travel together because they are cousins and that a horse kicked Lennie in the head when he was a child. They are hired. They meet Candy, an old “swamper,” or handyman, with a missing hand and an ancient dog, and Curley, the boss’s mean-spirited son. Curley is newly married, possessive of his flirtatious wife, and full of jealous suspicion. Once George and Lennie are alone in the bunkhouse, Curley’s wife appears and flirts with them. Lennie thinks she is “purty,” but George, sensing the trouble that could come from tangling with this woman and her husband, warns Lennie to stay away from her. Soon, the ranch-hands return from the fields for lunch, and George and Lennie meet Slim, the skilled mule driver who wields great authority on the ranch. Slim comments on the rarity of friendship like that between George and Lennie. Carlson, another ranch-hand, suggests that since Slim’s dog has just given birth, they should offer a puppy to Candy and shoot Candy’s old, good-for-nothing dog.
The next day, George confides in Slim that he and Lennie are not cousins, but have been friends since childhood. He tells how Lennie has often gotten them into trouble. For instance, they were forced to flee their last job because Lennie tried to touch a woman’s dress and was accused of rape. Slim agrees to give Lennie one of his puppies, and Carlson continues to badger Candy to kill his old dog. When Slim agrees with Carlson, saying that death would be a welcome relief to the suffering animal, Candy gives in. Carlson, before leading the dog outside, promises to do the job painlessly.
Slim goes to the barn to do some work, and Curley, who is maniacally searching for his wife, heads to the barn to accost Slim. Candy overhears George and Lennie discussing their plans to buy land, and offers his life’s savings if they will let him live there too. The three make a pact to let no one else know of their plan. Slim returns to the bunkhouse, berating Curley for his suspicions. Curley, searching for an easy target for his anger, finds Lennie and picks a fight with him. Lennie crushes Curley’s hand in the altercation. Slim warns Curley that if he tries to get George and Lennie fired, he will be the laughingstock of the farm.
The next night, most of the men go to the local brothel. Lennie is left with Crooks, the lonely, Black stable-hand, and Candy. Curley’s wife flirts with them, refusing to leave until the other men come home. She notices the cuts on Lennie’s face and suspects that he, and not a piece of machinery as Curley claimed, is responsible for hurting her husband. This thought amuses her. The next day, Lennie accidentally kills his puppy in the barn. Curley’s wife enters and consoles him. She admits that life with Curley is a disappointment, and wishes that she had followed her dream of becoming a movie star. Lennie tells her that he loves petting soft things, and she offers to let him feel her hair. When he grabs too tightly, she cries out. In his attempt to silence her, he accidentally breaks her neck.
Lennie flees back to a pool of the Salinas River that George had designated as a meeting place should either of them get into trouble. As the men back at the ranch discover what has happened and gather together a lynch party, George joins Lennie. Much to Lennie’s surprise, George is not mad at him for doing “a bad thing.” George begins to tell Lennie the story of the farm they will have together. As he describes the rabbits that Lennie will tend, the sound of the approaching lynch party grows louder. George shoots his friend in the back of the head.
When the other men arrive, George lets them believe that Lennie had the gun, and George wrestled it away from him and shot him. Only Slim understands what has really happened, that George has killed his friend out of mercy. Slim consolingly leads him away, and the other men, completely puzzled, watch them leave."
Head,"Howard Roark, a brilliant young architect, is expelled from his architecture school for refusing to follow the school’s outdated traditions. He goes to New York to work for Henry Cameron, a disgraced architect whom Roark admires. Roark’s schoolmate, Peter Keating, moves to New York and goes to work for the prestigious architectural firm Francon & Heyer, run by the famous Guy Francon. Roark and Cameron create beautiful work, but their projects rarely receive recognition, whereas Keating’s ability to flatter and please brings him almost instant success. In just a few years, he becomes a partner at the firm after he causes Francon’s previous partner to have a stroke. Henry Cameron retires, financially ruined, and Roark opens his own small office. His unwillingness to compromise his designs in order to satisfy clients eventually forces him to close down the office and take a job at a granite quarry in Connecticut.
	In Connecticut, Roark feels an immediate, passionate attraction to Dominique Francon, Guy Francon’s temperamental and beautiful daughter. Society disgusts Dominique, and she has retreated to her family’s estate to escape the mediocre architecture she sees all around her. One night, Roark enters the house and rapes her. Dominique discovers that this is what she had needed, but when she looks for Roark, he has left the quarry to design a building for a prominent New York businessman. Dominique returns to New York and discovers Roark’s identity. She realizes that he designed a building she admires. Dominique and Roark begin to meet in secret, but in public she tries to sabotage his career and destroy him. Ellsworth Toohey, an architectural critic and socialist, slowly prepares to rise to power. He seeks to prevent men from excelling by teaching that talent and ability are of no great consequence, and that the greatest virtue is humility. Toohey sees Roark as a great threat and tries to destroy him. Toohey convinces a weak-minded businessman named Hopton Stoddard to hire Roark as the designer for a temple dedicated to the human spirit, then persuades the businessman to sue Roark once the building is completed. At Roark’s trial, every prominent architect in New York testifies that Roark’s style is unorthodox and illegitimate, but Dominique declares that the world does not deserve the gift Roark has given it. Stoddard wins the case and Roark loses his business again. To punish herself for desiring Roark, Dominique marries Peter Keating.
	Enter Gail Wynand, a brilliant publisher, who has lost his early idealism and made his fortune by printing newspapers that say exactly what the public wants to hear. Wynand meets Dominique and falls in love with her, so he buys her from Keating by offering him money and a prestigious contract in exchange for his wife. Dominique agrees to marry Wynand because she thinks he is an even worse person than Keating, but to her surprise, Wynand is a man of principle. Wynand and Roark meet and become fast friends, but Wynand does not know the truth about Roark’s relationship with Dominique. Meanwhile Keating, who has fallen from grace, asks Roark for help with the Cortlandt Homes, a public housing project. The idea of economical housing intrigues Roark. He agrees to design the project and let Keating take the credit on the condition that no one makes a single alteration to his plan.
	When Roark returns from a summer-long yacht trip with Wynand, he finds that, despite the agreement, the Cortlandt Homes project has been changed. Roark asks Dominique to distract the night watchman one night and then dynamites the building. When the police arrive, he submits without resistance. The entire country condemns Roark, but Wynand finally finds the courage to follow his convictions and orders his newspapers to defend him. The Banner’s circulation drops and the workers go on strike, but Wynand keeps printing with Dominique’s help. Eventually, Wynand gives in and denounces Roark. At the trial, Roark seems doomed, but he rouses the courtroom with a statement about the value of selfishness and the need to remain true to oneself. Roark describes the triumphant role of creators and the price they pay at the hands of corrupt societies. The jury finds him not guilty. Roark marries Dominique. Wynand asks Roark to design one last building, a skyscraper that will testify to the supremacy of man."
Politics,"In Common Sense, Thomas Paine argues for American independence. His argument begins with more general, theoretical reflections about government and religion, then progresses onto the specifics of the colonial situation.
Paine begins by distinguishing between government and society. Society, according to Paine, is everything constructive and good that people join together to accomplish. Government, on the other hand, is an institution whose sole purpose is to protect us from our own vices. Government has its origins in the evil of man and is therefore a necessary evil at best. Paine says that government's sole purpose is to protect life, liberty and property, and that a government should be judged solely on the basis of the extent to which it accomplishes this goal.
Paine then considers an imagined scenario in which a small group of people has been placed on an island, and cut off from the rest of society. In time, these people develop ties with one another, and lawmaking becomes inevitable. Paine says the people will be much happier if they are responsible for the creation of the laws that rule them. Paine is also implicitly arguing that such a system of representation is also better for the American colonists. Having expressed his disagreement with British reign in America, Paine proceeds to launch a general attack on the British system of government. Paine says the British system is too complex and rife with contradictions, and that the monarchy is granted far too much power. The British system pretends to offer a reasonable system of checks and balances, but in fact, it does not.
From here Paine moves on to discuss, in general, the notions of monarchy and hereditary succession. Man, Pain argues, was born into a state of equality, and the distinction that has arisen between king and subject is an unnatural one. At first, Paine says, the world was without kings, but the ancient Jews decided they wanted a king. This angered God, but he allowed them to have one. Paine presents pages of biblical evidence detailing God's wrath at the idea of the Jews having a king. The conclusion Paine reaches is that the practice of monarchy originates from sin, and is an institution that the Bible and God condemn. Paine calls hereditary succession an abominable practice. He says that even if people were to choose to have a king, that does not legitimize that King's child acting as a future ruler. Furthermore, hereditary succession has brought with it innumerable evils, such as incompetent kings, corruption, and civil war.
Having dispensed with the preliminary theoretical issues, Paine sets in to discuss the details of the American situation. In response to the argument that America has flourished under British rule, and therefore ought to stay under the king, Paine says that such an argument fails to realize that America has evolved and no longer needs Britain's help. Some say that Britain has protected America, and therefore deserves allegiance, but Paine responds that Britain has only watched over America in order to secure its own economic well-being. Paine adds that most recently, instead of watching over the colonies, the British have been attacking them, and are therefore undeserving of American loyalty.
Paine says that the colonies have little to gain from remaining attached to Britain. Commerce can be better conducted with the rest of Europe, but only after America becomes independent. Paine also asserts that if the colonies remain attached to Britain, the same problems that have arisen in the past will arise in the future. Paine argues that it is necessary to seek independence now, as to do otherwise would only briefly cover up problems that will surely reemerge.
Paine even proposes the form of government that the independent colonies should adopt. His recommendation is for a representative democracy that gives roughly equal weight to each of the colonies.
Paine explains why the current time is a good time to break free of Britain. Primarily, Paine focuses on the present size of the colonies, and on their current capabilities. He presents an inventory of the British Navy and gives calculations revealing how America could build a navy of comparable size. Paine recommends this as a way of ensuring America's security and prosperity in trade. Paine also argues that America is sufficiently small as to be united now. If time were to elapse, and the population of the colonies to grow, the same feeling of unity would not be present. Paine adds that if the Americans revolt now, they can use the vast expanses of uncharted land to the West in order to pay down some of the debt they will incur.
Paine says that as a colony of Britain, America lacks respectability on the international scene. They are seen simply as rebels, and cannot form substantial alliances with other nations. In order to prosper in the long term, the colonies need to be independent. Paine says that, by declaring independence, America will be able to ask for the help of other countries in its struggle for freedom. For all of these reasons, Paine says it is imperative and urgent that the colonies declare independence."
Watchfulness,"Guy Montag is a fireman who burns books in a futuristic American city. In Montag’s world, firemen start fires rather than putting them out. The people in this society do not read books, enjoy nature, spend time by themselves, think independently, or have meaningful conversations. Instead, they drive very fast, watch excessive amounts of television on wall-size sets, and listen to the radio on “Seashell Radio” sets attached to their ears.
Montag encounters a gentle seventeen-year-old girl named Clarisse McClellan, who opens his eyes to the emptiness of his life with her innocently penetrating questions and her unusual love of people and nature. Over the next few days, Montag experiences a series of disturbing events. First, his wife, Mildred, attempts suicide by swallowing a bottle of sleeping pills. Then, when he responds to an alarm that an old woman has a stash of hidden literature, the woman shocks him by choosing to be burned alive along with her books. A few days later, he hears that Clarisse has been killed by a speeding car. Montag’s dissatisfaction with his life increases, and he begins to search for a solution in a stash of books that he has stolen from his own fires and hidden inside an air-conditioning vent.
When Montag fails to show up for work, his fire chief, Beatty, pays a visit to his house. Beatty explains that it’s normal for a fireman to go through a phase of wondering what books have to offer, and he delivers a dizzying monologue explaining how books came to be banned in the first place. According to Beatty, special-interest groups and other “minorities” objected to books that offended them. Soon, books all began to look the same, as writers tried to avoid offending anybody. This was not enough, however, and society as a whole decided to simply burn books rather than permit conflicting opinions. Beatty tells Montag to take twenty-four hours or so to see if his stolen books contain anything worthwhile and then turn them in for incineration. Montag begins a long and frenzied night of reading.
Overwhelmed by the task of reading, Montag looks to his wife for help and support, but she prefers television to her husband’s company and cannot understand why he would want to take the terrible risk of reading books. He remembers that he once met a retired English professor named Faber sitting in a park, and he decides that this man might be able to help him understand what he reads. He visits Faber, who tells him that the value of books lies in the detailed awareness of life that they contain. Faber says that Montag needs not only books but also the leisure to read them and the freedom to act upon their ideas.
Faber agrees to help Montag with his reading, and they concoct a risky scheme to overthrow the status quo. Faber will contact a printer and begin reproducing books, and Montag will plant books in the homes of firemen to discredit the profession and to destroy the machinery of censorship. Faber gives him a two-way radio earpiece (the “green bullet”) so that he can hear what Montag hears and talk to him secretly.
Montag goes home, and soon two of his wife’s friends arrive to watch television. The women discuss their families and the war that is about to be declared in an extremely frivolous manner. Their superficiality angers him, and he takes out a book of poetry and reads “Dover Beach” by Matthew Arnold. Faber buzzes in his ear for him to be quiet, and Mildred tries to explain that the poetry reading is a standard way for firemen to demonstrate the uselessness of literature. The women are extremely disturbed by the poem and leave to file a complaint against Montag.
Montag goes to the fire station and hands over one of his books to Beatty. Beatty confuses Montag by barraging him with contradictory quotations from great books. Beatty exploits these contradictions to show that literature is morbid and dangerously complex, and that it deserves incineration. Suddenly, the alarm sounds, and they rush off to answer the call, only to find that the alarm is at Montag’s own house. Mildred gets into a cab with her suitcase, and Montag realizes that his own wife has betrayed him.
Beatty forces Montag to burn the house himself; when he is done, Beatty places him under arrest. When Beatty continues to berate Montag, Montag turns the flamethrower on his superior and proceeds to burn him to ashes. Montag knocks the other firemen unconscious and runs. The Mechanical Hound, a monstrous machine that Beatty has set to attack Montag, pounces and injects Montag’s leg with a large dose of anesthetic. Montag manages to destroy it with his flamethrower; then he walks off the numbness in his leg and escapes with some books that were hidden in his backyard. He hides these in another fireman’s house and calls in an alarm from a pay phone.
Montag goes to Faber’s house, where he learns that a new Hound has been put on his trail, along with several helicopters and a television crew. Faber tells Montag that he is leaving for St. Louis to see a retired printer who may be able to help them. Montag gives Faber some money and tells him how to remove Montag’s scent from his house so the Hound will not enter it. Montag then takes some of Faber’s old clothes and runs off toward the river. The whole city watches as the chase unfolds on TV, but Montag manages to escape in the river and change into Faber’s clothes to disguise his scent. He drifts downstream into the country and follows a set of abandoned railroad tracks until he finds a group of renegade intellectuals (“the Book People”), led by a man named Granger, who welcome him. They are a part of a nationwide network of book lovers who have memorized many great works of literature and philosophy. They hope that they may be of some help to mankind in the aftermath of the war that has just been declared. Montag’s role is to memorize the Book of Ecclesiastes. Enemy jets appear in the sky and completely obliterate the city with bombs. Montag and his new friends move on to search for survivors and rebuild civilization."
Policy,"Marjane “Marji” Satrapi is an intelligent, spirited, and very modern girl living with her parents in Iran’s capital of Tehran during the eventful period of Iranian history from the late 1970s into the early 1980s. In Persepolis: The Story of a Childhood, Marji’s remembers her life during those years, mostly from when she was about ten to age fourteen. This account includes how Marji and her family lived through and were affected by turbulent events that included the overthrow of the autocratic Shah of Iran by the Islamic revolution, the oppressive fundamentalist regime that replaced the Shah, and the devasting Iran-Iraq war.
The nation’s wealth has long made it a target of outside invaders, but Islamic revolution of 1979 has pushed out the Western-backed government of the Shah.  The revolution has ushered in a new Islamic regime that is bringing massive societal changes impacting how people are supposed to behave--including Marji and her family. Marji struggles to adjust to the changes at her liberal French bilingual school, which has become increasingly stricter. Girls are required to wear veils and female and male students are now separated. Marji’s wealthy and modern parents—her father, Ebi, and her mother, Taji—take part in the massive protests against the new regime’s strict rules on behavior (just as they had previously protested against the Shah’s regime). Marji’s parents worry when a photo of Marji’s mother a protest appears in newspapers magazines. Later, after a demonstration they are at turns violent, the Satrapis decide that openly protesting is too dangerous to continue to do.
Marji feels conflict between her own deeply spiritual feelings and the stark modernism of her parents. She talks to God at night and has believed she will become a prophet one day since she was six years old, Marji. But the revolution leads to Marji setting aside these ambitions while she studies and imitates protestors and revolutionaries. She mimics protestors in the garden of her house and studies books about famous revolutionaries and philosophers given to her by her parents. She fantasizes about becoming a hero and wants her parents to become heroes too. Marji’s relationship with God becomes strained, as she finds that she and God have less to talk about—although God does still come by to see her from time to time.
Marji thrills when she learns that rebels fill her family history. She learns that her grandfather was a prince and later a communist whom the Shah removed from power and that her uncle Anoosh, also a communist, spent nine years in prison during the Shah’s regime. Marji spends a short time with Anoosh, learning about his life. After the Shah fell from power in 1979, Anoosh was released from prison, but when Islamic fundamentalists consolidate their grip on power, they hunt Anoosh down, imprison him, and later execute him. Her new idol killed, Marji feels crushed. She completely abandons her faith in God and increasingly questions the pro-regime propaganda she hears—especially at school.
Marji deeply loves and identifies with of her parents, even if she does sometimes feel that their actions and behavior (as wealthy and privileged individuals) do not always live up to their pro-democratic and liberal rhetoric. Marji also has a special connection with her grandmother, who remains stoic and inspiring to Marji in spite of the turmoil and numerous tragedies stemming from political actions that impact her and the family. Marji’s uncle Anoosh is not Marji’s only direct experience with the cruel consequences of the government’s actions. Throughout the book, death and devastation occurs among Marji’s extended family and friends as direct results of the brutality and fanaticism of the Iranian regimes and the war with Iraq.
People had rejoiced when the Shah was forced out, but as Islamic fundamentalists retain power, Marji and her family watch as their neighbors’ behavior shifts back and forth to coincide with the current political winds. The neighbors go from wearing short skirts and drinking alcohol to covering themselves and denouncing the use of alcohol. Marji’s parents ask her to tell everyone that she prays every day, a lie they hope will keep Marji safe, but acknowledge that the rules seem foolish. Marji grows more rebellious, as she increasingly views the rules at school and elsewhere as hypocritical and difficult to follow. Armed with more knowledge and personal experience, Marji begins to act out in ways that put her safety at risk. In fact, she even (accidentally) hits her principal during an argument, which results in her expulsion from school. Fearing her rebellious behavior will get her killed, Marji’s mother tries to reason with Marji by telling her that it is not her responsibility to serve justice and that the bad guys eventually pay for their sins in the end.
The war with Iraq had originally inspired Marji to vocal patriotism in protection her country against another invasion, but Marji begins to realize there are greater forces behind the war. She sees how the Islamic regime needs the war to continue survive and keep power. The war promotes a sense of nationalism and pride in the public, and those who die in the war are hailed as “martyrs.” Marji sees thousands of poor boys lured into war without proper training. She becomes increasingly uncomfortable and aware of class differences within society. Poor young boys are lured into the army with gold-painted keys to the “kingdom of heaven” to help them enter paradise after dying on the battlefield, while children in her wealthy neighborhood are left alone.
More and more people try to escape Iran as the borders tighten and Iraqi forces bomb Tehran and other Iranian cities. Realizing that Marji’s chances of escaping Iran are narrowing, her parents make the difficult decision to send her abroad alone to finish school in Vienna, explaining that only a good education will free her of Iran. Marji feels heartbroken. She spends one last night with her grandmother, who gives her warm advice and inspires her to be compassionate and understanding while in Vienna. Marji gives away all of her prized contraband to her friends, including a Kim Wilde poster. At the airport, as Marji turns to say goodbye to her parents one last time to see that her mother, devasted by her only child’s departure, has fainted."
Seneca,"Euripedes' Medea opens in a state of conflict. Jason has abandoned his wife, Medea, along with their two children. He hopes to advance his station by remarrying with Glauce, the daughter of Creon, king of Corinth, the Greek city where the play is set. All the events of play proceed out of this initial dilemma, and the involved parties become its central characters.
Outside the royal palace, a nurse laments the events that have lead to the present crisis. After a long series of trials and adventures, which ultimately forced Jason and Medea to seek exile in Corinth, the pair had settled down and established their family, achieving a degree of fame and respectability. Jason's recent abandonment of that family has crushed Medea emotionally, to the degree that she curses her own existence, as well as that of her two children.
Fearing a possible plot of revenge, Creon banishes Medea and her children from the city. After pleading for mercy, Medea is granted one day before she must leave, during which she plans to complete her quest for ""justice""--at this stage in her thinking, the murder of Creon, Glauce, and Jason. Jason accuses Medea of overreacting. By voicing her grievances so publicly, she has endangered her life and that of their children. He claims that his decision to remarry was in everyone's best interest. Medea finds him spineless, and she refuses to accept his token offers of help.
Appearing by chance in Corinth, Aegeus, King of Athens, offers Medea sanctuary in his home city in exchange for her knowledge of certain drugs that can cure his sterility. Now guaranteed an eventual haven in Athens, Medea has cleared all obstacles to completing her revenge, a plan which grows to include the murder of her own children; the pain their loss will cause her does not outweigh the satisfaction she will feel in making Jason suffer.
For the balance of the play, Medea engages in a ruse; she pretends to sympathize with Jason (bringing him into her confidence) and offers his wife ""gifts,"" a coronet and dress. Ostensibly, the gifts are meant to convince Glauce to ask her father to allow the children to stay in Corinth. The coronet and dress are actually poisoned, however, and their delivery causes Glauce's death. Seeing his daughter ravaged by the poison, Creon chooses to die by her side by dramatically embracing her and absorbing the poison himself.
A messenger recounts the gruesome details of these deaths, which Medea absorbs with cool attentiveness. Her earlier state of anxiety, which intensified as she struggled with the decision to commit infanticide, has now given way to an assured determination to fulfill her plans. Against the protests of the chorus, Medea murders her children and flees the scene in a dragon-pulled chariot provided by her grandfather, the Sun-God. Jason is left cursing his lot; his hope of advancing his station by abandoning Medea and marrying Glauce, the conflict which opened the play, has been annihilated, and everything he values has been lost through the deaths that conclude the tragedy."
Fleet,"Agamemnon begins with a Watchman on duty on the roof of the palace at Argos, waiting for a signal announcing the fall of Troy to the Greek armies. A beacon flashes, and he joyfully runs to tell the news to Queen Clytemnestra. When he is gone, the Chorus, made up of the old men of Argos, enters and tells the story of how the Trojan Prince Paris stole Helen, the wife of the Greek king Menelaus, leading to ten years of war between Greece and Troy. Then the Chorus recalls how Clytemnestra's husband Agamemnon (Menelaus' brother) sacrificed their daughter Iphigenia to the god Artemis to obtain a favorable wind for the Greek fleet.
The Queen appears, and the Chorus asks her why she has ordered sacrifices of thanksgiving. She tells them that a system of beacons has brought word that Troy fell the previous night. The Chorus give thanks to the gods, but wonder if her news is true; a Herald appears and confirms the tidings, describing the army's sufferings at Troy and giving thanks for a safe homecoming. Clytemnestra sends him back to Agamemnon, to tell her husband to come swiftly, but before he departs, the Chorus asks him for news of Menelaus. The Herald replies that a terrible storm seized the Greek fleet on the way home, leaving Menelaus and many others missing.
The Chorus sings of the terrible destructive power of Helen's beauty. Agamemnon enters, riding in his chariot with Cassandra, a Trojan Princess whom he has taken as his slave and concubine. Clytemnestra welcomes him, professing her love, and orders a carpet of purple robes spread in front of him as he enters the palace. Agamemnon acts coldly toward her, and says that to walk on the carpet would be an act of hubris, or dangerous pride; she badgers him into walking on the robes, however, and he enters the palace.
The Chorus expresses a sense of foreboding, and Clytemnestra comes outside to order Cassandra inside. The Trojan Princess is silent, and the Queen leaves her in frustration. Then Cassandra begins to speak, uttering incoherent prophecies about a curse on the house of Agamemnon. She tells the Chorus that they will see their king dead, says that she will die as well, and then predicts that an avenger will come. After these bold predictions, she seems resigned to her fate, and enters the house. The Chorus' fears grow, and they hear Agamemnon cry out in pain from inside. As they debate what to do, the doors open, and Clytemnestra appears, standing over the corpses of her husband and Cassandra. She declares that she has killed him to avenge Iphigenia, and then is joined by her lover Aegisthus, Agamemnon's cousin, whose brothers were cooked and served to Aegisthus' father by Agamemnon's father. They take over the government, and the Chorus declares that Clytemnestra's son Orestes will return from exile to avenge his father."
Forums,"In Outliers: The Story of Success, Malcolm Gladwell considers the circumstances that lead to success. The first half of the book looks closely at how opportunities matter more in the lives of successful people than hard work or raw talent. The second half of the book focuses on cultural legacies: behavioral tendencies rooted in their ancestral past.
Part One examines the role of opportunity in the lives of extremely successful people. Gladwell’s first example is the Canadian Hockey League, the world’s most competitive youth hockey league. Since the cutoff date for the Canadian leagues that serve the youngest players is January 1, those born in the first part of the calendar year are much larger and more coordinated than their peers. The larger and more coordinated kids are given more playing time and better coaching, and thus become better players by the time they reach the top league. An overwhelming majority of Canadian professional hockey players have birthdays in January, February or March.
Gladwell proposes that 10,000 hours of practice is needed to master a skill, even for prodigies like Mozart. Bill Joy, Bill Gates, and the Beatles all worked hard to achieve success but benefited from opportunities they did not create. Joy, one of the founders of Sun Microsystems, happened to attend one of the first colleges in the world with a time-sharing terminal. In graduate school, he had a terminal in his room, where he spent all of his free time programming. Gates happened to attend a private high school with a time-sharing terminal connected to a mainframe in Seattle. He also was able to spend all of his free time programming. Early on, the Beatles were hired to play long shows day after day in Hamburg, Germany. 
Birth year or era is another form of opportunity. Gates and Joy (as well as other early programmers) all reached the end of their teen years just as personal computers became available to the public. In another example, fourteen of the top seventy-five richest people in the history of the world happened to be alive at the same time, in the same country: the United States in the mid-1800s.
Opportunity matters more than an individual’s IQ. Using a study conducted by Lewis Terman, the creator of the Stanford-Binet IQ test, Gladwell shows that “practical intelligence” is as important as “analytical intelligence.” He also contrasts Chris Langan, one of the world’s smartest living people, with Robert Oppenheimer. While both had difficulties in college, only Oppenheimer had a successful life, due to his practical intelligence.
The last portion of Part One looks at Joe Flom, a successful lawyer from New York City. While he was born into a poor family to Jewish immigrants (in a time when Jewish immigrants were not treated well), many of the disadvantages in his life were actually benefits and directly contributed to his success.
Part Two investigates cultural legacies. Using flight recorder transcripts from several plane crashes from the last few decades, Gladwell shows that cultural expectations and habits can be a severe hindrance to pilots. Copilots from countries that have a high “Power Distance Index” (those that show the most deference to authority) will often avoid telling pilots that they are making mistakes, even when the mistakes are potentially fatal. After recognizing the dangers of such cultural expectations, commercial aviation has instituted programs to change the way flight crews talk with one another. 
Gladwell next analyzes the disparity in public school math test scores between Eastern and Western countries. He suggests that the cultures in which rice paddy farming is historically important have a stronger work ethic. Using various examples, Gladwell shows that hard work has a greater impact on success in learning mathematics than intelligence. 
The final example is an examination of the KIPP school in the South Bronx and the “achievement gap” between socioeconomic groups. American students from middle-class and affluent households retain more information over summer vacation and are more likely to make additional gains than students from low-income households. The KIPP school uses longer school days and summer programming to eliminate the achievement gap for low-income children. While the work schedule is very rigorous, the school’s students go on to great academic success.
Gladwell demonstrates that if more opportunities were available, there would be far more successful people and the world would be richer for it."
Quick,"In the midst of a raging war, a plane evacuating a group of schoolboys from Britain is shot down over a deserted tropical island. Two of the boys, Ralph and Piggy, discover a conch shell on the beach, and Piggy realizes it could be used as a horn to summon the other boys. Once assembled, the boys set about electing a leader and devising a way to be rescued. They choose Ralph as their leader, and Ralph appoints another boy, Jack, to be in charge of the boys who will hunt food for the entire group.
Ralph, Jack, and another boy, Simon, set off on an expedition to explore the island. When they return, Ralph declares that they must light a signal fire to attract the attention of passing ships. The boys succeed in igniting some dead wood by focusing sunlight through the lenses of Piggy’s eyeglasses. However, the boys pay more attention to playing than to monitoring the fire, and the flames quickly engulf the forest. A large swath of dead wood burns out of control, and one of the youngest boys in the group disappears, presumably having burned to death.
At first, the boys enjoy their life without grown-ups and spend much of their time splashing in the water and playing games. Ralph, however, complains that they should be maintaining the signal fire and building huts for shelter. The hunters fail in their attempt to catch a wild pig, but their leader, Jack, becomes increasingly preoccupied with the act of hunting.
When a ship passes by on the horizon one day, Ralph and Piggy notice, to their horror, that the signal fire—which had been the hunters’ responsibility to maintain—has burned out. Furious, Ralph accosts Jack, but the hunter has just returned with his first kill, and all the hunters seem gripped with a strange frenzy, reenacting the chase in a kind of wild dance. Piggy criticizes Jack, who hits Piggy across the face. Ralph blows the conch shell and reprimands the boys in a speech intended to restore order. At the meeting, it quickly becomes clear that some of the boys have started to become afraid. The littlest boys, known as “littluns,” have been troubled by nightmares from the beginning, and more and more boys now believe that there is some sort of beast or monster lurking on the island. The older boys try to convince the others at the meeting to think rationally, asking where such a monster could possibly hide during the daytime. One of the littluns suggests that it hides in the sea—a proposition that terrifies the entire group.
Not long after the meeting, some military planes engage in a battle high above the island. The boys, asleep below, do not notice the flashing lights and explosions in the clouds. A parachutist drifts to earth on the signal-fire mountain, dead. Sam and Eric, the twins responsible for watching the fire at night, are asleep and do not see the parachutist land. When the twins wake up, they see the enormous silhouette of his parachute and hear the strange flapping noises it makes. Thinking the island beast is at hand, they rush back to the camp in terror and report that the beast has attacked them.
The boys organize a hunting expedition to search for the monster. Jack and Ralph, who are increasingly at odds, travel up the mountain. They see the silhouette of the parachute from a distance and think that it looks like a huge, deformed ape. The group holds a meeting at which Jack and Ralph tell the others of the sighting. Jack says that Ralph is a coward and that he should be removed from office, but the other boys refuse to vote Ralph out of power. Jack angrily runs away down the beach, calling all the hunters to join him. Ralph rallies the remaining boys to build a new signal fire, this time on the beach rather than on the mountain. They obey, but before they have finished the task, most of them have slipped away to join Jack.
Jack declares himself the leader of the new tribe of hunters and organizes a hunt and a violent, ritual slaughter of a sow to solemnize the occasion. The hunters then decapitate the sow and place its head on a sharpened stake in the jungle as an offering to the beast. Later, encountering the bloody, fly-covered head, Simon has a terrible vision, during which it seems to him that the head is speaking. The voice, which he imagines as belonging to the Lord of the Flies, says that Simon will never escape him, for he exists within all men. Simon faints. When he wakes up, he goes to the mountain, where he sees the dead parachutist. Understanding then that the beast does not exist externally but rather within each individual boy, Simon travels to the beach to tell the others what he has seen. But the others are in the midst of a chaotic revelry—even Ralph and Piggy have joined Jack’s feast—and when they see Simon’s shadowy figure emerge from the jungle, they fall upon him and kill him with their bare hands and teeth.
The following morning, Ralph and Piggy discuss what they have done. Jack’s hunters attack them and their few followers and steal Piggy’s glasses in the process. Ralph’s group travels to Jack’s stronghold in an attempt to make Jack see reason, but Jack orders Sam and Eric tied up and fights with Ralph. In the ensuing battle, one boy, Roger, rolls a boulder down the mountain, killing Piggy and shattering the conch shell. Ralph barely manages to escape a torrent of spears.
Ralph hides for the rest of the night and the following day, while the others hunt him like an animal. Jack has the other boys ignite the forest in order to smoke Ralph out of his hiding place. Ralph stays in the forest, where he discovers and destroys the sow’s head, but eventually, he is forced out onto the beach, where he knows the other boys will soon arrive to kill him. Ralph collapses in exhaustion, but when he looks up, he sees a British naval officer standing over him. The officer’s ship noticed the fire raging in the jungle. The other boys reach the beach and stop in their tracks at the sight of the officer. Amazed at the spectacle of this group of bloodthirsty, savage children, the officer asks Ralph to explain. Ralph is overwhelmed by the knowledge that he is safe but, thinking about what has happened on the island, he begins to weep. The other boys begin to sob as well. The officer turns his back so that the boys may regain their composure."
Intensely,"Verity opens in contemporary New York City, as protagonist Lowen Ashleigh witnesses a bloody accident where a passerby is hit by a truck. Lowen, a struggling writer, is grieving her mother's recent death and wondering where her foundering career is headed. She writes thrillers, but she’s suffering from intense writer’s block, which her state of uncertainty only seems to worsen. She’s so numbed to reality that she barely registers the accident, even as she’s soaked with the victim’s blood. 
To her surprise, a stranger helps clean her up, and they share a moment of intense romantic chemistry. She soon discovers his name is Jeremy Crawford, and that he’s married to bestselling author Verity Crawford. This author—whom Lowen respects enormously for her meticulous research and well–crafted plots—has been left incapacitated by a car accident. Verity is an internationally renowned writer, who is best known for her tactic of writing novels from the perspective of the villain. In a meeting at Pantem Publishing, Jeremy offers Lowen a significant sum to finish Verity’s final series of novels. Lowen’s agent Corey encourages her to take the deal, but Lowen is extremely nervous about the prospect. However, she can’t refuse the enormous sum the Crawfords propose to pay her. She accepts the offer with some trepidation. The narrative then moves to Vermont, the location of the Crawford family home. At Jeremy’s invitation, Lowen moves in temporarily to sort through Verity’s office and get a feel for her writing.  
However, while trying to research Verity’s work, she discovers an unpublished autobiography of Verity’s that unveils startling secrets about her life. This unpublished manuscript, entitled So Be It, disrupts the kind and loving façade that Verity has been painstakingly keeping up for over a decade. After this point, Lowen’s perspective in the novel is occasionally replaced by Verity’s as chapters of this autobiography appear in full. Rather than the loving mother and wife everyone else apparently knew, it paints Verity as a selfish and manipulative person with little regard for anyone else’s feelings. Because Verity lies comatose upstairs as Lowen reads this, Lowen begins to feel extremely uneasy about her discovery. She decides to keep the autobiography hidden from Jeremy, especially when she discovers that it reveals information that connects Verity to the tragic deaths of the Crawfords' twin daughters, Harper and Chastin. 
Lowen soon settles into life in Vermont and begins to build a relationship with Jeremy and Crew, his only living child. It’s a double life, as she grows emotionally attached to Jeremy while attempting to avoid the judgment of the Crawfords’ neighbors and nurses. She’s also concurrently and secretly following the chilling revelations that unfold constantly as she gets further into So Be It. The more Lowen becomes consumed with Verity’s dual existence, the more intensely she feels a romantic connection to Jeremy. At this point in the novel, Jeremy has only acted respectfully, unselfishly, and chivalrously in every interaction Lowen has seen. Although she knows he’s married, she can’t shake her attraction to him. The two draw closer and closer as their attraction to each other becomes too strong to ignore. Financial circumstances and an apartment offer falling through mean Lowen has to stay in Vermont much longer than planned. This gives her time for two things outside of her work: to get to know Jeremy and to develop a building horror of Verity’s presence and the unnerving coincidences that seem to follow her. Lowen quickly begins to feel that she’s being carefully watched. 
Lowen begins to write Verity’s remaining books in earnest, sending outlines to her agent and trying to make sense of her mass of papers and notes. However, the temptation to covertly read more of Verity’s autobiography is strong whenever Lowen is alone in the office. Every time she succumbs to it, she discovers more unnerving things about Verity’s sociopathic, transactional view of relationships. She discovers that Verity is an obsessive, jealous lover who tried to abort her own twins when she realizes she would have to share Jeremy’s love with them. It also quickly becomes evident that Verity was directly involved in the murder of her daughter, Harper. She believed Harper had deliberately killed Chastin, even though there was no proof, o Verity killed Harper. Lowen is caught in a moral dilemma because this evidence had previously remained totally concealed. She struggles with whether it would be fitting or even ethically correct to expose Verity’s secrets to Jeremy, or if it would be kinder to protect him from the painful truth about his homicidal, mentally unstable wife. 
While all this is happening, the atmosphere in the Crawford home is becoming increasingly tense and mysterious. Lowen feels she is constantly being observed and begins noticing inconsistencies whenever Verity is left alone. Doors are inexplicably locked and unlocked, household objects disappear, and devices mysteriously turn off or are set to mute. Lowen is sensitive to small coincidences and to the privacy that locked doors promise because she has a history of dangerous sleepwalking. She suspects that Verity can move around and isn’t actually comatose at all. This is later reinforced by Crew, who accidentally mentions things his mother has recently said to him. Despite all this, Lowen's feelings for Jeremy deepen, and they begin a romantic, sexual relationship. This all contributes to the novel’s climax, where Lowen reveals the autobiography to Jeremy. Jeremy doesn’t want to believe Lowen when she tells him Verity is not immobilized, but he eventually relents and agrees to read So Be It. After Lowen gives him the autobiography, she waits in agony for him to finish it. She hears him cry out in pain and storm upstairs to confront his wife. 
Verity pretends to have no reaction when Jeremy speaks to her and only responds when he threatens to hand her manuscript over to the police. She drops the mask of being unconscious and reveals she’s been aware of everything that’s happening in the Crawford house. She’s been pretending to be comatose while manipulating the situation to test Jeremy's loyalty to her, and to try and escape with their son Crew and the funds from Lowen’s new books. Jeremy, furious, tries to strangle her for killing Harper. Lowen stops him, telling him that if he kills her that way, Crew will lose his father. She suggests instead that if Jeremy forces her to vomit, they can make the murder look like inhalation pneumonia and avoid a criminal investigation. Jeremy does so, and Verity dies gruesomely, choking on her own vomit. 
At the end of the novel, Jeremy, Crew, and a pregnant Lowen are in the process of moving out of the Vermont house to start a new life in North Carolina. However, Lowen finds a letter addressed to Jeremy hidden under the floorboards in her room. In this letter, Verity makes shocking revelations. She reveals that she’d written the autobiography first as writing practice and then as a therapeutic exercise, casting herself as the “antagonistic narrator” as she did in her novels. The letter says that she had planned to escape with Crew and explains that Harper’s death was actually an accident. She says she still loves Jeremy and regrets what happened but must prioritize Crew’s safety. Lowen panics and destroys the manuscript, deciding never to burden Jeremy with the knowledge of it.  
However, she’s still unsure whether the letter or the autobiography reflects the absolute truth. The novel ends with Lowen questioning the extent to which any of the people involved in the Crawfords’ family tragedies understood the whole of the matter and acknowledging the ingenious manipulations Verity was able to orchestrate."
Anything,"Maddy, about to turn eighteen, lives in Los Angeles. She has spent her whole life indoors, due to a diagnosis of Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID). Any contact with the outside world puts her at risk of a fatal infection or allergic reaction. The house is elaborately sealed, with an airlock at the front door. Maddy is cared for by her mother, who is a doctor, and by a full-time nurse, Carla. When Maddy was just a few months old, her father and brother were killed in an accident.
A new family moves in next door. The father drinks and is violent. Maddy and the boy in the family, Olly, become friends over the Internet. They also pantomime conversations through their bedroom windows. Eventually, Carla agrees to let Olly come over for in-person visits. Carla monitors the visits and does not tell Maddy’s mother about them. Soon, Maddy and Olly’s relationship takes a romantic turn.
After Maddy impulsively rushes out of the house to intervene in a fight between Olly and his father, her mother finds out about the visits. She fires Carla. In the fall, Olly starts school. Maddy stays in touch with him and tries to repair her damaged relationship with her mother. Her mother gives her a framed photo of their family, taken in Hawaii shortly before her father and brother died. One day, Maddy decides to risk her life in order to live fully. She books a short trip for her and Olly, to Hawaii.
After Olly gets over his misgivings, he and Maddy fly to Hawaii. They spend a wonderful, intimate day together, but in the middle of the night, Maddy wakes up with aches and fever chills. Olly calls an ambulance to take her to the hospital. Meanwhile, Maddy’s mother has learned where they were and has boarded a flight to Hawaii. When she arrives, she puts Maddy on a plane back home.
Maddy and her mother try to resume life as before. Maddy misses Olly but believes she must shut her heart to the possibility of love. She deletes all of Olly’s emails, unread. Her mother, seeing how sad Maddy is, rehires Carla. Olly and his mother and sister move out of their house, leaving his father behind, alone.
Maddy receives an email from the doctor who treated her in Hawaii. The doctor questions whether Maddy has SCID and urges her to consult a doctor other than her mother. Confronted, Maddy’s mother insists that Maddy really is sick. Searching her mother’s office at night, however, Maddy finds no record of a SCID diagnosis, nor any records of the years of treatment. A specialist contacted by Carla confirms: Maddy does not have SCID. The shock and grief Maddy’s mother felt over losing her husband and son expressed itself as a pathological need to protect Maddy from all possibility of harm.
Maddy is angry at her mother and wants to leave home, but Carla counsels her to be more compassionate. Maddy books a flight to New York. During the flight, she begins to forgive her mother. In New York, she and Olly happily reunite."
White,"In White Fragility: Why It’s So Hard for White People to Talk About Racism, author Robin DiAngelo’s subject is race relations in the United States. As a white woman who grew up in America in the late twentieth century, DiAngelo uses her position to address white people and help them see the racist structures that hold up and to continue to shape American society. DiAngelo’s years of work as a diversity workshop trainer have given her insight into the difficulties white people have talking about race. DiAngelo has witnessed the defensiveness that can immediately surface in some white people during conversations about race. She directs this book at white people, to help them understand the origins of their defensiveness and overcome it. She intends to describe the ways white people can help dismantle the underlying structures of white supremacy that still govern American institutions. 
According to DiAngelo, most white people in the United States do not realize that American society is a normalization of white supremacy, because most white people just accept the status quo, which is white. As the dominant ethnic group at the establishment of the United States, European Americans shaped the values and racial makeup of American society today. Most Americans understand that good neighborhoods, good schools, and a good life correspond to white neighborhoods, white schools, and a white life. While there is some mixing of races in these areas, the message to people of color is that the default white life is the ideal to be achieved. White people receive this socialization more subtly, as their privilege tends to allow them to live a white life by default, and without as much struggle to achieve it. White Americans internalize the myth of meritocracy and believe that through hard work, all Americans can achieve the American dream. But many whites don’t understand that they are already many steps ahead of people of color, simply by virtue of the institutions established by white Americans before them, which continue to benefit them. 
These underlying racist structures make life slightly easier, more comfortable, and less taxing for a typical white American than for an equivalent person of color of a similar social class. Until white Americans can acknowledge the existence of these structures, they will continue to exhibit what DiAngelo calls “white fragility.” Most white Americans latch onto “the good/bad binary,” which equates racists with people who hurl insults or commit acts of violence against people of color. By implication, all other white Americans are safely in the good camp. 
However, because of the structures governing the daily routines of American lives, white people continue to unconsciously support the structures that allow the majority of white and Black people to live relatively segregated lives. Most every American strives to live in a better neighborhood, so their child can attend better schools, and then better universities, which will help them achieve success in life. It is understood that “good” in this sense means “majority white.” Although housing covenants blocking people of color from buying homes in certain neighborhoods were outlawed by the Civil Rights Act of 1964, property prices keep many people of color from living in prized neighborhoods. Most public school systems depend on funding from local property taxes. Good schools go hand in hand with good neighborhoods. Many wealthy people also opt out of the public school systems entirely, and put their money and energy into supporting schools that are even further out of reach for people of color. Just by continuing to participate in existing structures, white people perpetuate racist policies. 
DiAngelo has been hired by groups and companies to help them improve their hiring diversity or learn how better to retain people of color. She has seen firsthand how talking about race makes white people inherently nervous, because they do not want to be classified as racist. In her workshops, and in this book, DiAngelo tries to help whites understand that it is the wider societal structures governing American society that make certain acts racist, as experienced by Black people. 
Once aware of how anti-Blackness sentiments manifest within the wider societal structures, whites can help Black people and people of color maneuver better through the system. Whites can support affirmative action programs, and programs that make it easier to people of color to get loans for college or a home. Understanding systemic racism also keeps whites from becoming defensive when talking about race, and the conversation becomes less about defending perceived accusations of personal racism and more about constructively helping people of color. By acknowledging the existence of the underlying racism on which structures and institutions that benefit them are built, DiAngelo believes, white people can overcome their inherent white fragility and become allies in helping to dismantle these structures."
For,"Irene Redfield is a light-skinned Black woman who, in public places, occasionally passes for white, when she finds it convenient. Irene is a practical, determined person. She was born and raised in Chicago but now lives in Harlem with her husband, Brian, and their two boys. Brian is a successful doctor but dislikes his work. He would have preferred to move the entire family to another, less racist country long ago, but Irene has always insisted that the family belongs in New York.
One day, while back in Chicago for a visit, Irene has a chance meeting with a childhood friend, Clare. Clare is very different from Irene—self-centered, melodramatic, and reckless. Clare is even lighter-skinned than Irene, and in fact she has married a white man, John Bellew, without telling him that she is Black. They have a daughter. The Bellews live mostly in Europe but often spend time in the Unites States, depending on where John Bellew’s work in international banking takes him. Irene finds Clare strangely fascinating but does not like her company. She only reluctantly agrees to visit Clare at the Bellews’ hotel suite. Clare has invited a mutual light-skinned friend of theirs to join them. When John Bellew arrives, Irene is shocked to learn that he is a vehement racist. He openly declares that he hates Black people, not knowing that he is speaking to three of them.
Two years later, the Bellews have relocated to New York. Clare resumes contact with Irene, and Irene is not firm enough to insist that Clare leave her alone, if only to keep Clare’s secret safe. When Clare learns that Irene is planning a charity event at which upper-class Black people and white people will mingle, Clare insists on attending. Soon, she is at the Redfields’ home regularly and has become part of their social circle. In time, Irene suspects that Clare and Brian are having an affair. The Bellews are due to move back to Europe soon, but a chance downtown encounter between John Bellew and Irene, while Irene is with a darker-skinned friend, creates a crisis. If Bellew deduces that Clare, like Irene, is Black, he may divorce Clare and leave her free to pursue Brian.
The threat that Clare poses for Irene’s marriage and family life is unexpectedly removed when Bellew tracks Clare down at an all-Black party hosted by friends of the Redfields in their apartment atop a high residential building. Bellew angrily confronts Clare, but Clare smiles and acts unconcerned. When Irene angrily moves toward Clare and puts her hand on Clare’s arm, Clare tumbles out a nearby open window, to her death. The cause of her fall is unclear—whether she fainted and fell by accident, or fell deliberately. It is also possible that Irene pushed Clare, but no one accuses her."
Intelligent,"In Outliers: The Story of Success, Malcolm Gladwell considers the circumstances that lead to success. The first half of the book looks closely at how opportunities matter more in the lives of successful people than hard work or raw talent. The second half of the book focuses on cultural legacies: behavioral tendencies rooted in their ancestral past.
Part One examines the role of opportunity in the lives of extremely successful people. Gladwell’s first example is the Canadian Hockey League, the world’s most competitive youth hockey league. Since the cutoff date for the Canadian leagues that serve the youngest players is January 1, those born in the first part of the calendar year are much larger and more coordinated than their peers. The larger and more coordinated kids are given more playing time and better coaching, and thus become better players by the time they reach the top league. An overwhelming majority of Canadian professional hockey players have birthdays in January, February or March.
Gladwell proposes that 10,000 hours of practice is needed to master a skill, even for prodigies like Mozart. Bill Joy, Bill Gates, and the Beatles all worked hard to achieve success but benefited from opportunities they did not create. Joy, one of the founders of Sun Microsystems, happened to attend one of the first colleges in the world with a time-sharing terminal. In graduate school, he had a terminal in his room, where he spent all of his free time programming. Gates happened to attend a private high school with a time-sharing terminal connected to a mainframe in Seattle. He also was able to spend all of his free time programming. Early on, the Beatles were hired to play long shows day after day in Hamburg, Germany. 
Birth year or era is another form of opportunity. Gates and Joy (as well as other early programmers) all reached the end of their teen years just as personal computers became available to the public. In another example, fourteen of the top seventy-five richest people in the history of the world happened to be alive at the same time, in the same country: the United States in the mid-1800s.
Opportunity matters more than an individual’s IQ. Using a study conducted by Lewis Terman, the creator of the Stanford-Binet IQ test, Gladwell shows that “practical intelligence” is as important as “analytical intelligence.” He also contrasts Chris Langan, one of the world’s smartest living people, with Robert Oppenheimer. While both had difficulties in college, only Oppenheimer had a successful life, due to his practical intelligence.
The last portion of Part One looks at Joe Flom, a successful lawyer from New York City. While he was born into a poor family to Jewish immigrants (in a time when Jewish immigrants were not treated well), many of the disadvantages in his life were actually benefits and directly contributed to his success.
Part Two investigates cultural legacies. Using flight recorder transcripts from several plane crashes from the last few decades, Gladwell shows that cultural expectations and habits can be a severe hindrance to pilots. Copilots from countries that have a high “Power Distance Index” (those that show the most deference to authority) will often avoid telling pilots that they are making mistakes, even when the mistakes are potentially fatal. After recognizing the dangers of such cultural expectations, commercial aviation has instituted programs to change the way flight crews talk with one another. 
Gladwell next analyzes the disparity in public school math test scores between Eastern and Western countries. He suggests that the cultures in which rice paddy farming is historically important have a stronger work ethic. Using various examples, Gladwell shows that hard work has a greater impact on success in learning mathematics than intelligence. 
The final example is an examination of the KIPP school in the South Bronx and the “achievement gap” between socioeconomic groups. American students from middle-class and affluent households retain more information over summer vacation and are more likely to make additional gains than students from low-income households. The KIPP school uses longer school days and summer programming to eliminate the achievement gap for low-income children. While the work schedule is very rigorous, the school’s students go on to great academic success.
Gladwell demonstrates that if more opportunities were available, there would be far more successful people and the world would be richer for it."
Mall,"The full title of Moll Flanders gives an apt summary of the plot: ""The Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Famous Moll Flanders, Etc. Who was born in Newgate, and during a life of continu'd Variety for Threescore Years, besides her Childhood, was Twelve Year a Whore, five times a Wife (whereof once to her own brother), Twelve Year a Thief, Eight Year a Transported Felon in Virginia, at last grew Rich, liv'd Honest and died a Penitent. Written from her own Memorandums.""
Moll Flanders is born to a mother who has been convicted of a felony and who is transported to America soon after her birth. As an infant, Moll lives on public charity, under the care of a kind widow who teaches her manners and needlework. She grows into a beautiful teenager and is seduced at an early age. Abandoned by her first lover, she is compelled to marry his younger brother. He dies after a few years, and she marries a draper who soon flees the country as a fugitive from the law. She marries yet again and moves to America, only to find out that her husband is actually her half-brother. She leaves him in disgust and returns to England, where she becomes the mistress of a man whose wife has gone insane. He renounces his affair with Moll after a religious experience.
Moll's next marriage offer is from a banker whose wife has been cheating on him. Moll agrees to marry him if he can obtain a divorce, and meanwhile she travels to the country and marries a rich gentleman in Lancashire. This man turns out to be a fraud--he is as poor as she is--and they part ways to seek their fortunes separately. Moll returns to marry the banker, who by this time has succeeded in divorcing his wife. He dies soon after, however, and Moll is thrown back upon her own resources once again. She lives in poverty for several years and then begins stealing. She is quite talented at this new ""trade"" and soon becomes an expert thief and a local legend. Eventually she is caught, imprisoned, and sentenced to death. In prison at Newgate, she reunites with her Lancashire husband, who has also been arrested. They both manage to have their sentences reduced, and they are transported to the colonies, where they begin a new life as plantation owners. In America, Moll rediscovers her brother and her son and claims the inheritance her mother has left her. Prosperous and repentant, she returns with her husband to England at the age of seventy."
Threatening,"Lawyer Bryan Stevenson gives a first-person account of his decades helping marginalized Americans who have been unfairly and harshly punished by the U.S. criminal justice system, which disproportionately targets people of color and poor people. At the heart of Just Mercy is the story of Walter McMillian, a Black man who was framed for the murder of a girl named Ronda Morrison, convicted, and sent to death row. 
Stevenson alternates chapters about Walter with his personal reflections on our country’s history with racial disparity and issues around incarceration. Stevenson highlights other groups of vulnerable people who have been victimized by the criminal justice system and shares the stories of the prisoners he has helped over the years. The book also follows the growth of Stevenson’s nonprofit law project, the Alabama-based Equal Justice Initiative (EJI), through its expansion from focusing on death row prisoners to helping people sentenced to life without parole. Stevenson chronicles how EJI becomes a significant force in criminal justice reform.
In 1983 as a law student, Stevenson discovers his life’s passion when he interns with the Georgia-based Southern Prisoners Defense Committee and meets his first death row prisoner. After graduation Stevenson accepts a job with the organization to represent poor prisoners, including those in Alabama who lack any public defender. He meets Walter McMillian on Alabama’s death row. Walter owns a successful business but also transgresses racial boundaries when he has an affair with a white woman. Soon after the affair becomes public, the woman’s friend, Ralph Myers, accuses Walter of committing the unsolved murder of Ronda Morrison, which has outraged the community. Law enforcement, including a racist sheriff and the district attorney, eagerly pounces on this accusation, overlooking Walter’s alibi and a lack of evidence. Instead, they actively force Ralph to stick with his story even when he tries to recant. They coerce other false witness testimonies, and—as revealed years later—actively suppress evidence.
After Stevenson and the team at EJI unsuccessfully appeal Walter’s conviction, they launch their own investigation of the crime and uncover new evidence. They find witnesses who can prove the witnesses against Walter lied as well as financial records that indicate that one of these witnesses was paid to give false testimony. Stevenson and his team also petition for and receive all records from Walter’s trial. However, their big break comes when they receive a phone call from Ralph, who now wants to make amends. Ralph admits to lying about Walter and says he was threatened by law enforcement. Stevenson wins a hearing for Walter where he can present his new evidence: Ralph’s testimony, which is confirmed by health care workers and other inmates, as well as recordings of the law enforcement team threatening Ralph if he doesn’t frame Walter. 
While the judge refuses to grant Walter relief, Stevenson continues the appeal process through the Alabama courts. The district attorney asks outside agents to investigate the murder for which Walter was convicted, and the investigators determine that Walter had nothing to do with the crime. Six weeks later, the court invalidates Walter’s conviction. Stevenson and the State file a joint motion to dismiss the charges, and Walter is set free.
Throughout the process, Stevenson and Walter become close friends, and Stevenson helps Walter upon his release, including filing a civil suit on his behalf and offering him a place to stay. Walter works with Stevenson to share his story, giving interviews and speaking at legal conferences, and Walter is even featured in a documentary. Unfortunately, Walter is diagnosed with advancing dementia and is forced to rely on family and eventually a nursing facility for his care. He dies in 2013. Stevenson gives a eulogy at his funeral and shares all he learned from Walter, particularly that we must extend mercy to everyone, even those who have not earned it.
Interspersed with chapters chronicling Walter’s narrative are stories of Stevenson’s other clients and work. His closeness with these prisoners and their horrifying circumstances makes Stevenson more determined to help and causes him to reflect on abstract issues that nevertheless imbue the criminal justice system, like humanity and mercy. Stevenson focuses on several categories of vulnerable people who become trapped in the system, including mentally ill prisoners, disabled prisoners, and poor women who give birth to stillborn babies. 
Stevenson and his team at EJI also become increasingly focused on juvenile offenders who are sometimes tried as adults despite their young age. These offenders may be given de facto death sentences by being sentenced to life without parole and face perilous circumstances when they are housed in adult prisons. Stevenson illustrates how these prisoners retain their own humanity while being forced to live under inhumane conditions. He also discusses some of the qualities common among these types of prisoners: They are generally poor and disproportionately people of color, and most of them lack adequate legal counsel. The juveniles have horrific backgrounds of abuse and neglect.
Stevenson and his team at EJI also work to change the legal system to offer more protection to marginalized people. Several of his cases end up before the U.S. Supreme Court, and he succeeds in winning rulings that ban as unconstitutional the conviction of children to life without parole and the execution of people deemed incompetent from dementia or neurological disease. EJI works to raise public awareness of issues surrounding unfair incarceration, produces groundbreaking reports on racial issues, and sets up programs to help formerly incarcerated people adjust to life on the outside.
Stevenson also reflects on the issues that surround the criminal justice system. His time spent with prisoners awaiting their execution makes him realize how inhumane it is to prepare another human to die. After decades of work, when Stevenson fails to prevent the execution of a man who suffers from an intellectual disability, he momentarily feels unable to continue his work. However, he realizes that he cannot help but be broken by his experiences and comes to understand that it is his own brokenness that allows him to more fully understand the need for mercy and to bring compassion to others. The book ends with Stevenson’s renewed commitment to helping others."
Preceded,"The narrative outlines the events surrounding the murder of Santiago Nasar, a young man who is thought to have taken the virginity of Angela Vicario. On her wedding night, after discovering that she was not a virgin, Angela's husband, Bayardo San Roman, returns her to her house. Angela's twin brothers, Pedro Vicario and Pablo Vicario, ask her who took her virginity, and she tells them that Santiago Nasar did. The brothers find Santiago and kill him.
The narrative is non-linear. The narrator begins the story by telling us about Santiago Nasar's household the morning he was murdered. In the course of the chapter, we learn that Santiago lived with his mother, Placida Linero; their cook, Victoria Guzman; and her daughter, Divina Flor. Santiago's father, Ibrahim Nasar, has died three years previously. After his father died, Santiago took over the family ranch, which has been very successful; the Nasars are wealthy in their community.
The day that Santiago is murdered was a significant day in town because the Bishop was coming by boat to bless the marriage of Angela Vicario and Bayardo San Roman. Many people were heading over to the dock to see the boats. Pedro and Pablo Vicario were sitting in the local milk-shop, which was en route to the dock, so that they could see Santiago Nasar either going or returning in order to track him down and kill him. The narrator's sister learns that Angela Vicario was returned home on the night of her wedding.
Bayardo San Roman had come to town to find a bride. After deciding on Angela, the courtship was short. Because Bayardo came from a prestigious, wealthy family, and the Vicarios were relatively poor, Angela did not really have a choice, even though she did not love Bayardo at the time they were wed.
The night before the murder, there had been lots of wedding revelry that had continued into the early morning at a local whorehouse run by Maria Alejandrina Cervantes, where Santiago Nasar had been carousing with the twins and the narrator until early in the morning. After returning home and finding their sister in disgrace, the Vicario brothers set out to avenge her honor by murdering Santiago Nasar. Even though they repeatedly announced their intent to murder him, the butcher, the police officer, and the Colonel all thought that the Vicarios are largely bluffing. Clothilde Armenta, the proprietor of the milk shop, even told the local priest about what the Vicario twins were threatening to do. However, in the excitement surrounding the arrival of the bishop, he forgot about her warning.
After the murder, the entire Vicario family left town because of the disgrace the combination of events had brought upon their family. A week after the murder, Bayardo San Roman left with his family; they came and retrieved him by boat. The Vicario brothers were imprisoned for three years. After their release from prison, Pablo proceeded to marry his betrothed, Prudencia Cotes, and Pedro went back into the armed forces.
After Bayardo returned Angela to her home on their wedding night, she fell in love with him. After she moved away from the town where she was disgraced, she wrote him letters every week for seventeen years, and eventually he returned to her.
For years after the crime, it was all anyone in the town spoke of. The narrator tells how his friend Cristo Bedoya searched frantically for Santiago the morning of the murder in order to warn him of the Vicario brothers' plan, but failed to find Santiago because he did not realize that Santiago had gone to the house of his fiance, Flora Miguel. Her father was the first to warn Santiago of the murder. At this point, there were crowds of people outside who had come to see the Bishop but had lingered because they had heard the rumor that Santiago was to be killed.
When he left Flora Miguel's house, Santiago was very confused. Clothilde Armenta yelled at him to run, and he ran the fifty yards to his front door. The Vicario brothers easily caught up with him, and stabbed him to death right outside of Santiago's front door."
Lady,"Isabel Archer is a woman in her early twenties who comes from a genteel family in Albany, New York, in the late 1860s. Her mother died when she was a young girl, and her father raised her in a haphazard manner, allowing her to educate herself and encouraging her independence. As a result, the adult Isabel is widely read, imaginative, confident in her own mind, and slightly narcissistic; she has the reputation in Albany for being a formidable intellect, and as a result she often seems intimidating to men. She has had few suitors, but one of them is Caspar Goodwood, the powerful, charismatic son of a wealthy Boston mill owner. Isabel is drawn to Caspar, but her commitment to her independence makes her fear him as well, for she feels that to marry him would be to sacrifice her freedom.
Shortly after Isabel's father dies, she receives a visit from her indomitable aunt, Mrs. Touchett, an American who lives in Europe. Mrs. Touchett offers to take Isabel on a trip to Europe, and Isabel eagerly agrees, telling Caspar that she cannot tell him whether she wishes to marry him until she has had at least a year to travel in Europe with her aunt. Isabel and Mrs. Touchett leave for England, where Mrs. Touchett's estranged husband is a powerful banker. Isabel makes a strong impression on everyone at Mr. Touchett's county manor of Gardencourt: her cousin Ralph, slowly dying of a lung disorder, becomes deeply devoted to her, and the Touchetts' aristocratic neighbor Lord Warburton falls in love with her. Warburton proposes, but Isabel declines; though she fears that she is passing up a great social opportunity by not marrying Warburton, she still believes that marriage would damage her treasured independence. As a result, she pledges to accomplish something wonderful with her life, something that will justify her decision to reject Warburton.
Isabel's friend Henrietta Stackpole, an American journalist, believes that Europe is changing Isabel, slowly eroding her American values and replacing them with romantic idealism. Henrietta comes to Gardencourt and secretly arranges for Caspar Goodwood to meet Isabel in London. Goodwood again presses Isabel to marry him; this time, she tells him she needs at least two years before she can answer him, and she promises him nothing. She is thrilled to have exercised her independence so forcefully. Mr. Touchett's health declines, and Ralph convinces him that when he dies, he should leave half his wealth to Isabel: this will protect her independence and ensure that she will never have to marry for money. Mr. Touchett agrees shortly before he dies. Isabel is left with a large fortune for the first time in her life. Her inheritance piques the interest of Madame Merle, Mrs. Touchett's polished, elegant friend; Madame Merle begins to lavish attention on Isabel, and the two women become close friends.
Isabel travels to Florence with Mrs. Touchett and Madame Merle; Merle introduces Isabel to a man named Gilbert Osmond, a man of no social standing or wealth, but whom Merle describes as one of the finest gentlemen in Europe, wholly devoted to art and aesthetics. Osmond's daughter Pansy is being brought up in a convent; his wife is dead. In secret, Osmond and Merle have a mysterious relationship; Merle is attempting to manipulate Isabel into marrying Osmond so that he will have access to her fortune. Osmond is pleased to marry Isabel, not only for her money, but also because she makes a fine addition to his collection of art objects.
Everyone in Isabel's world disapproves of Osmond, especially Ralph, but Isabel chooses to marry him anyway. She has a child the year after they are married, but the boy dies six months after he is born. Three years into their marriage, Isabel and Osmond have come to despise one another; they live with Pansy in a palazzo in Rome, where Osmond treats Isabel as barely a member of the family: to him, she is a social hostess and a source of wealth, and he is annoyed by her independence and her insistence on having her own opinions. Isabel chafes against Osmond's arrogance, his selfishness, and his sinister desire to crush her individuality, but she does not consider leaving him. For all her commitment to her independence, Isabel is also committed to her social duty, and when she married Osmond, she did so with the intention of transforming herself into a good wife.
A young American art collector who lives in Paris, Edward Rosier, comes to Rome and falls in love with Pansy; Pansy returns his feelings. But Osmond is insistent that Pansy should marry a nobleman, and he says that Rosier is neither rich nor highborn enough. Matters grow complicated when Lord Warburton arrives on the scene and begins to court Pansy. Warburton is still in love with Isabel and wants to marry Pansy solely to get closer to her. But Osmond desperately wants to see Pansy married to Warburton. Isabel is torn about whether to fulfill her duty to her husband and help him arrange the match between Warburton and Pansy, or to fulfill the impulse of her conscience and discourage Warburton, while helping Pansy find a way to marry Rosier.
At a ball one night, Isabel shows Warburton the dejected-looking Rosier and explains that this is the man who is in love with Pansy. Guiltily, Warburton admits that he is not in love with Pansy; he quietly arranges to leave Rome. Osmond is furious with Isabel, convinced that she is plotting intentionally to humiliate him. Madame Merle is also furious with her, confronting her with shocking impropriety and demanding brazenly to know what she did to Warburton. Isabel has realized that there is something mysterious about Madame Merle's relationship with her husband; now, she suddenly realizes that Merle is his lover.
At this time, Ralph is rapidly deteriorating, and Isabel receives word that he is dying. She longs to travel to England to be with him, but Osmond forbids it. Now Isabel must struggle to decide whether to obey his command and remain true to her marriage vows or to disregard him and hurry to her cousin's bedside. Encouraging her to go, Osmond's sister, the Countess Gemini, tells her that there is still more to Merle and Osmond's relationship. Merle is Pansy's mother; Pansy was born out of wedlock. Osmond's wife died at about the same time, so Merle and Osmond spread the story that she died in childbirth. Pansy was placed in a convent to be raised, and she does not know that Merle is her real mother. Isabel is shocked and disgusted by her husband's atrocious behavior—she even feels sorry for Merle for falling under his spell—so she decides to follow her heart and travel to England.
After Ralph's death, Isabel struggles to decide whether to return to her husband or not. She promised Pansy that she would return to Rome, and her commitment to social propriety impels her to go back and honor her marriage. But her independent spirit urges her to flee from Osmond and find happiness elsewhere. Caspar Goodwood appears at the funeral, and afterwards, he asks Isabel to run away with him and forget about her husband. The next day, unable to find her, Goodwood asks Henrietta where she has gone. Henrietta quietly tells him that Isabel has returned to Rome, unable to break away from her marriage to Gilbert Osmond."
Whilst,"A Raisin in the Sun portrays a few weeks in the life of the Youngers, a Black family living on the South Side of Chicago in the 1950s. When the play opens, the Youngers are about to receive an insurance check for $10,000. This money comes from the deceased Mr. Younger’s life insurance policy. Each of the adult members of the family has an idea as to what he or she would like to do with this money. The matriarch of the family, Mama, wants to buy a house to fulfill a dream she shared with her husband. Mama’s son, Walter Lee, would rather use the money to invest in a liquor store with his friends. He believes that the investment will solve the family’s financial problems forever. Walter’s wife, Ruth, agrees with Mama, however, and hopes that she and Walter can provide more space and opportunity for their son, Travis. Finally, Beneatha, Walter’s sister and Mama’s daughter, wants to use the money for her medical school tuition. She also wishes that her family members were not so interested in assimilating into the white world. Beneatha instead tries to find her identity by looking back to the past and to Africa.
As the play progresses, the Youngers clash over their competing dreams. Ruth discovers that she is pregnant but fears that if she has the child, she will put more financial pressure on her family members. When Walter says nothing to Ruth’s admission that she is considering abortion, Mama puts a down payment on a house for the whole family. She believes that a bigger, brighter dwelling will help them all. This house is in Clybourne Park, an entirely white neighborhood. When the Youngers’ future neighbors find out that the Youngers are moving in, they send Mr. Lindner, from the Clybourne Park Improvement Association, to offer the Youngers money in return for staying away. The Youngers refuse the deal, even after Walter loses the rest of the money ($6,500) to his friend Willy Harris, who persuades Walter to invest in the liquor store and then runs off with his cash.
In the meantime, Beneatha rejects her suitor, George Murchison, whom she believes to be shallow and blind to the problems of race. Subsequently, she receives a marriage proposal from her Nigerian boyfriend, Joseph Asagai, who wants Beneatha to get a medical degree and move to Africa with him (Beneatha does not make her choice before the end of the play). The Youngers eventually move out of the apartment, fulfilling the family’s long-held dream. Their future seems uncertain and slightly dangerous, but they are optimistic and determined to live a better life. They believe that they can succeed if they stick together as a family and resolve to defer their dreams no longer."
Man,"The narrator begins telling his story with the claim that he is an “invisible man.” His invisibility, he says, is not a physical condition—he is not literally invisible—but is rather the result of the refusal of others to see him. He says that because of his invisibility, he has been hiding from the world, living underground and stealing electricity from the Monopolated Light & Power Company. He burns 1,369 light bulbs simultaneously and listens to Louis Armstrong’s “(What Did I Do to Be So) Black and Blue” on a phonograph. He says that he has gone underground in order to write the story of his life and invisibility.
As a young man, in the late 1920s or early 1930s, the narrator lived in the South. Because he is a gifted public speaker, he is invited to give a speech to a group of important white men in his town. The men reward him with a briefcase containing a scholarship to a prestigious Black college, but only after humiliating him by forcing him to fight in a “battle royal” in which he is pitted against other young Black men, all blindfolded, in a boxing ring. After the battle royal, the white men force the youths to scramble over an electrified rug in order to snatch at fake gold coins. The narrator has a dream that night in which he imagines that his scholarship is actually a piece of paper with a crude command to keep him running.
Three years later, the narrator is a student at the college. He is asked to drive a wealthy white trustee of the college, Mr. Norton, around the campus. Norton talks incessantly about his daughter, then shows an undue interest in the narrative of Jim Trueblood, a poor, uneducated Black man who impregnated his own daughter. After hearing this story, Norton needs a drink, and the narrator takes him to the Golden Day, a saloon and brothel that normally serves Black men. A fight breaks out among a group of Black veterans at the bar, and Norton passes out during the chaos. He is tended by one of the veterans, who claims to be a doctor and who taunts both Norton and the narrator for their blindness regarding race relations.
Back at the college, the narrator listens to a long, impassioned sermon by the Reverend Homer A. Barbee on the subject of the college’s Founder, whom the blind Barbee glorifies with poetic language. After the sermon, the narrator is chastised by the college president, Dr. Bledsoe, who has learned of the narrator’s misadventures with Norton at the old slave quarters and the Golden Day. Bledsoe rebukes the narrator, saying that he should have shown the white man an idealized version of Black life. He expels the narrator, giving him seven letters of recommendation addressed to the college’s white trustees in New York City, and sends him there in search of a job.
The narrator travels to the bright lights and bustle of 1930s Harlem, where he looks unsuccessfully for work. The letters of recommendation are of no help. At last, the narrator goes to the office of one of his letters’ addressees, a trustee named Mr. Emerson. There he meets Emerson’s son, who opens the letter and tells the narrator that he has been betrayed: the letters from Bledsoe actually portray the narrator as dishonorable and unreliable. The young Emerson helps the narrator to get a low-paying job at the Liberty Paints plant, whose trademark color is “Optic White.” The narrator briefly serves as an assistant to Lucius Brockway, the Black man who makes this white paint, but Brockway suspects him of joining in union activities and turns on him. The two men fight, neglecting the paint-making; consequently, one of the unattended tanks explodes, and the narrator is knocked unconscious.
The narrator wakes in the paint factory’s hospital, having temporarily lost his memory and ability to speak. The white doctors seize the arrival of their unidentified black patient as an opportunity to conduct electric shock experiments. After the narrator recovers his memory and leaves the hospital, he collapses on the street. Some black community members take him to the home of Mary, a kind woman who lets him live with her for free in Harlem and nurtures his sense of Black heritage. One day, the narrator witnesses the eviction of an elderly Black couple from their Harlem apartment. Standing before the crowd of people gathered before the apartment, he gives an impassioned speech against the eviction. Brother Jack overhears his speech and offers him a position as a spokesman for the Brotherhood, a political organization that allegedly works to help the socially oppressed. After initially rejecting the offer, the narrator takes the job in order to pay Mary back for her hospitality. But the Brotherhood demands that the narrator take a new name, break with his past, and move to a new apartment. The narrator is inducted into the Brotherhood at a party at the Chthonian Hotel and is placed in charge of advancing the group’s goals in Harlem.
After being trained in rhetoric by a white member of the group named Brother Hambro, the narrator goes to his assigned branch in Harlem, where he meets the handsome, intelligent black youth leader Tod Clifton. He also becomes familiar with the Black nationalist leader Ras the Exhorter, who opposes the interracial Brotherhood and believes that Black Americans should fight for their rights over and against all whites. The narrator delivers speeches and becomes a high-profile figure in the Brotherhood, and he enjoys his work. One day, however, he receives an anonymous note warning him to remember his place as a Black man in the Brotherhood. Not long after, the Black Brotherhood member Brother Wrestrum accuses the narrator of trying to use the Brotherhood to advance a selfish desire for personal distinction. While a committee of the Brotherhood investigates the charges, the organization moves the narrator to another post, as an advocate of women’s rights. After giving a speech one evening, he is seduced by one of the white women at the gathering, who attempts to use him to play out her sexual fantasies about Black men.
After a short time, the Brotherhood sends the narrator back to Harlem, where he discovers that Clifton has disappeared. Many other Black members have left the group, as much of the Harlem community feels that the Brotherhood has betrayed their interests. The narrator finds Clifton on the street selling dancing “Sambo” dolls—dolls that invoke the stereotype of the lazy and obsequious slave. Clifton apparently does not have a permit to sell his wares on the street. White policemen accost him and, after a scuffle, shoot him dead as the narrator and others look on. On his own initiative, the narrator holds a funeral for Clifton and gives a speech in which he portrays his dead friend as a hero, galvanizing public sentiment in Clifton’s favor. The Brotherhood is furious with him for staging the funeral without permission, and Jack harshly castigates him. As Jack rants about the Brotherhood’s ideological stance, a glass eye falls from one of his eye sockets. The Brotherhood sends the narrator back to Brother Hambro to learn about the organization’s new strategies in Harlem.
The narrator leaves feeling furious and anxious to gain revenge on Jack and the Brotherhood. He arrives in Harlem to find the neighborhood in ever-increased agitation over race relations. Ras confronts him, deploring the Brotherhood’s failure to draw on the momentum generated by Clifton’s funeral. Ras sends his men to beat up the narrator, and the narrator is forced to disguise himself in dark glasses and a hat. In his dark glasses, many people on the streets mistake him for someone named Rinehart, who seems to be a pimp, bookie, lover, and reverend all at once. At last, the narrator goes to Brother Hambro’s apartment, where Hambro tells him that the Brotherhood has chosen not to emphasize Harlem and the Black movement. He cynically declares that people are merely tools and that the larger interests of the Brotherhood are more important than any individual. Recalling advice given to him by his grandfather, the narrator determines to undermine the Brotherhood by seeming to go along with them completely. He decides to flatter and seduce a woman close to one of the party leaders in order to obtain secret information about the group.
But the woman he chooses, Sybil, knows nothing about the Brotherhood and attempts to use the narrator to fulfill her fantasy of being raped by a Black man. While still with Sybil in his apartment, the narrator receives a call asking him to come to Harlem quickly. The narrator hears the sound of breaking glass, and the line goes dead. He arrives in Harlem to find the neighborhood in the midst of a full-fledged riot, which he learns was incited by Ras. The narrator becomes involved in setting fire to a tenement building. Running from the scene of the crime, he encounters Ras, dressed as an African chieftain. Ras calls for the narrator to be lynched. The narrator flees, only to encounter two policemen, who suspect that his briefcase contains loot from the riots. In his attempt to evade them, the narrator falls down a manhole. The police mock him and draw the cover over the manhole.
The narrator says that he has stayed underground ever since; the end of his story is also the beginning. He states that he finally has realized that he must honor his individual complexity and remain true to his own identity without sacrificing his responsibility to the community. He says that he finally feels ready to emerge from underground."
Neighborhoods,"In a series of vignettes, The House on Mango Street covers a year in the life of Esperanza, a Chicana (Mexican-American girl), who is about twelve years old when the novel begins. During the year, she moves with her family into a house on Mango Street. The house is a huge improvement from the family’s previous apartment, and it is the first home her parents actually own. However, the house is not what Esperanza has dreamed of, because it is run-down and small. The house is in the center of a crowded Latino neighborhood in Chicago, a city where many of the poor areas are racially segregated. Esperanza does not have any privacy, and she resolves that she will someday leave Mango Street and have a house all her own.
Esperanza matures significantly during the year, both sexually and emotionally. The novel charts her life as she makes friends, grows hips, develops her first crush, endures sexual assault, and begins to write as a way of expressing herself and as a way to escape the neighborhood. The novel also includes the stories of many of Esperanza’s neighbors, giving a full picture of the neighborhood and showing the many possible paths Esperanza may follow in the future.
After moving to the house, Esperanza quickly befriends Lucy and Rachel, two Chicana girls who live across the street. Lucy, Rachel, Esperanza, and Esperanza’s little sister, Nenny, have many adventures in the small space of their neighborhood. They buy a bike, learn exciting stories about boys from a young woman named Marin, explore a junk shop, and have intimate conversations while playing Double Dutch (jumping rope). The girls are on the brink of puberty and sometimes find themselves sexually vulnerable, such as when they walk around their neighborhood in high-heeled shoes or when Esperanza is kissed by an older man at her first job. During the first half of the year, the girls are content to live and play in their child’s world. At school, Esperanza feels ashamed about her family’s poverty and her difficult-to-pronounce name. She secretly writes poems that she shares only with older women she trusts.
Over the summer, Esperanza slips into puberty. She suddenly likes it when boys watch her dance, and she enjoys dreaming about them. Esperanza’s newfound sexual maturity, combined with the death of two of her family members, her grandfather and her Aunt Lupe, bring her closer to the world of adults. She begins to closely watch the women in her neighborhood. This second half of The House on Mango Street presents a string of stories about older women in the neighborhood, all of whom are even more stuck in their situations and, quite literally, in their houses, than Esperanza is. Meanwhile, during the beginning of the following school year, Esperanza befriends Sally, a girl her age who is more sexually mature than Lucy or Rachel. Sally, meanwhile, has her own agenda. She uses boys and men as an escape route from her abusive father. Esperanza is not completely comfortable with Sally’s sexual experience, and their friendship results in a crisis when Sally leaves Esperanza alone, and a group of boys sexually assaults Esperanza in her absence.
Esperanza’s traumatic experiences as Sally’s friend, in conjunction with her detailed observations of the older women in her neighborhood, cement her desire to escape Mango Street and to have her own house. When Esperanza finds herself emotionally ready to leave her neighborhood, however, she discovers that she will never fully be able to leave Mango Street behind, and that after she leaves she’ll have to return to help the women she has left. At the end of the year, Esperanza remains on Mango Street, but she has matured extensively. She has a stronger desire to leave and understands that writing will help her put distance between herself and her situation. Though for now writing helps her escape only emotionally, in the future it may help her to escape physically as well."
Fostering,"Death introduces himself as the narrator of the novel. The first time he saw the book thief, he says, was on a train. The next time he saw her was when he came for a pilot who had crashed his plane. And the third time was after a bombing. He associates a color with each sighting: white, red, and black, the colors of the Nazi flag. Death then begins the story. Liesel, her mother, and her brother Werner are traveling on a train to Munich when Werner suddenly dies. Liesel and her mother get off the train to bury the body, and Liesel steals a book from one of the gravediggers. She and her mother continue their journey to a town called Molching, where Liesel will be raised by foster parents, Hans and Rosa Hubermann. At first Liesel doesn’t like her foster parents, but Hans wins her over by teaching her to roll cigarettes for him.
Slowly, Liesel adjusts to her new life, though she is plagued by nightmares of her dead brother. She meets and befriends a neighborhood boy named Rudy, who worships the American athlete Jesse Owens and constantly pesters Liesel to kiss him. When Hans discovers that Liesel doesn’t know how to read, he begins teaching her the alphabet, and together they make their way through the book Liesel stole from the gravedigger. Meanwhile, the political situation in Molching and throughout Germany is becoming serious, with war escalating and food and work shortages at home. When the town holds a book-burning to celebrate Hitler’s birthday, Liesel steals another book from the flames.
Liesel begins delivering laundry for Rosa. One of Rosa’s customers is the mayor’s wife, Ilsa Hermann. One day Liesel is invited into Ilsa Hermann’s study, where she marvels at the walls of books. Frau Hermann allows her to read in the study. Meanwhile, in Stuttgart, a German Jew named Max hides in a closet with no food, light, or water. A friend brings him false identity papers and a map hidden in MKPF, Hitler’s autobiography. Max leaves the closet and takes the train to the Hubermanns’ house. Hans, we learn, served with Max’s father in World War I. After Max’s father died, Hans promised Max’s mother he would always help her. When Max arrives in Molching, Hans and Rosa hide him in the basement. As he recovers from his ordeal, he and Liesel become friends, and Max writes her a book on the painted-over pages of MKPF.
Frau Hermann tells Liesel she can’t afford to send out the laundry anymore. Liesel is furious because her family is already struggling to survive and the Hermanns have so much. With Rudy’s help, Liesel begins sneaking into the Hermanns’ library and stealing books. For Christmas, Liesel builds Max a snowman in the basement. When Max gets sick and falls into a coma, Hans and Rosa worry about how they will dispose of the corpse if he dies. After months, Max recovers. Nazi soldiers arrive and inspect the basement to see if it is deep enough for a bomb shelter. Luckily, they don’t see Max. Liesel continues stealing books from the Hermanns’ library. Frau Hermann leaves her a dictionary and thesaurus with a note saying she knows Liesel has been stealing from her. At a Hitler Youth carnival, Rudy wins three races. The Allies begin bombing near Molching, and the people on Liesel’s block must take shelter in a neighbor’s basement. With each raid, Liesel reads to them until it’s safe to exit. Max, meanwhile, has to stay in the Hubermanns’ basement by himself.
As the war intensifies, Nazi soldiers begin parading Jewish prisoners through town on their way to the concentration camp at Dachau. When Hans sees an old man struggling to keep up with the group, he gives him a piece of bread. Nazi soldiers intervene and whip both the man and Hans. Hans realizes he has aroused suspicion and drawn attention to himself, and Max is no longer safe in the basement. That night, Max leaves Hans and Rosa’s house. Hans waits for soldiers to come take him away, but none do. Instead, they come to Rudy’s house, to recruit him for a school for future Nazi leaders. Rudy’s father, Alex, refuses to let his son go. The soldiers leave, but a few days later both Alex and Hans are drafted into the German army. After Alex and Hans leave for duty, Rudy and Liesel go to the next parade of Jews and scatter bread in the streets. Rosa gives Liesel a book that Max made for her called “The Word Shaker.” It is the story of Max and Liesel’s friendship, and promises they will be reunited some day.
Hans is sent to Essen, where he is part of a squad that cleans up after air raids. Another member of the squad takes a dislike to Hans, and one day he insists they change places on their work bus. The bus crashes and the other man is killed, while Hans merely breaks his leg. Hans gets sent home to recuperate. Following another air raid, Liesel and Rudy find an Allied fighter pilot who has crashed his plane. They arrive just in time to see him die. Death sees Liesel for the second time when he comes to collect the pilot’s soul. The Nazis continue to parade the Jews through Molching, and Liesel sees Max among the prisoners. Liesel tells Rudy about hiding Max. She had never told anyone before.
The mayor’s wife gives Liesel a blank notebook so she can begin writing her own story. One night, while Liesel is in the basement editing her book, her neighborhood is bombed. Hans, Rosa, Rudy, and the rest of the neighbors are killed. When rescue workers pull Liesel out of the rubble, she finds Rudy’s corpse and gives him the kiss he always wanted. When the workers take her away, she leaves behind her finished book, called “The Book Thief.” Death, who has been watching, rescues the book. Liesel goes to live with the mayor and his wife. After the liberation of the concentration camps, Max returns to Molching and finds Liesel. They hug and cry together. Liesel eventually grows up and moves to Australia, where she has a family and lives to an old age. When Death finally comes to take her soul, he shows her the book she wrote so many years before."
Page,"In “moon,” the first of the four parts of feed, an American teenager named Titus travels to the lunar surface with his high-school friends for spring break, hoping to escape the boredom they feel on Earth. No specific date is revealed, though it’s sometime in a dystopic future, where the moon is fully commercialized and people suffer from red sores called lesions. As Titus and his fellow upper-class friends Link, Marty, Calista, Loga, and Quendy arrive on the moon, readers also get their first glimpse of “the feed.” Although Titus doesn’t initially reveal exact details about the feed or how it works, he says it sends the friends ads and images for where to stay and shop. 
After failing to get into college-age parties, the group visits the Ricochet Lounge, where Titus becomes infatuated with a girl named Violet. She is beautiful and, he soon finds, visiting the moon by herself and is very unlike his friends: She doesn’t make pointless purchases at a mall they all soon visit and isn’t interested in malfunctioning, or falling into a drug-like stupor, via their connections to the feed. Later, when they all visit a dance club called the Rumble Spot, an old man from a dissenter group called the Coalition of Pity hacks into people’s individual feeds, causing them to broadcast the signal, “we enter a time of calamity” over the feed’s network. Police beat the man and “shut off” those hacked, including Titus and Violet, who hold hands as they collapse.
Part 2, “eden,” occurs in a lunar hospital where Violet, Titus, and his friends remain disconnected from the feed until their systems can be scanned for viruses. There, Titus provides additional details about what the feed is and how it works. Feeds are implanted inside the body and connect to a global network that provides news, entertainment, and a means to purchase every kind of product, he says while singing its praises. The feed even anticipates and creates users’ wants from individual profiles based on purchasing decisions, thoughts, and feelings. Titus and Violet grow closer during the stay. Violet, who’s home-schooled and smarter than Titus and his friends, says she hoped to enjoy herself like normal kids but now has a problem, though she remains vague about what this problem is. When doctors finally restore the friends’ feeds, they rejoice. Promotions begin to flow through their minds again, though there’s also ominous news concerning protests over America’s annexation of the moon and resulting anger from a group called the Global Alliance. Still, Titus says, the friends exalt in the return of their feeds.
In Part 3, “Utopia,” Titus and his friends return to Earth and life returns to normal for them: “upcars” travel in tubes past vertically stacked suburbs, the friends party, and U.S. President Trumbull scoffs at reports that claim toxic industries cause lesions. In defiance of rampant consumerism and a loss of individuality, Violet determines to resist the feed by creating a completely random customer profile and asks Titus to join her. Violet, who didn’t receive her feed until she was seven, voices deep concern about the decline of the world and destruction of Earth, and laments how those who’ve had the feed their entire lives are ignorant and self-centered. Titus soon has nightmares that are more likely hacks from the Coalition of Pity. In them, he sees disturbing images of eco destruction and human suffering around the world, but after Violet chats him, saying she has seen the images too, he only wants to go back to sleep.
Before long, Violet’s problem becomes clear: Her body begins to fail and she’s told by doctors that the damage to her feedware can be fatal. The prognosis makes Violet realize how much she wants to do. She starts by going to the seashore with Titus, though they need to dress in protective suits due to its toxicity. Meanwhile, feed chatter reveals that all of Earth’s forests have fallen and there is a growing rift between the U.S. and the Global Alliance. At a party where Quendy shows off her artificial lesions, Violet becomes outraged and her body falters. She chastises Titus and his friends for living in ignorance as the world dies, then collapses and is brought to the hospital. 
Violet’s condition declines further in Part 4, “slumberland,” whose chapter titles track her feed efficiency from a high of 87.3 percent to a low of 4.6 percent, 98 percent being optimal. Aware that she doesn’t have much time, Violet messages Titus a list of twenty-two things she wants to do in life, though he grows increasingly distant, and doesn’t message back. When they do reconnect, Violet sends Titus a recent memory where she falls down a staircase and receives a response from the corporation FeedTech, denying her petition to pay for her system repairs because she wasn’t deemed to be worthy due to her random customer profile. Violet later sends Titus childhood memories to preserve her history, though he deletes them. And when Violet convinces him to visit the mountains with her, one of her life goals, Titus breaks up with her, saying he was only interested in a short relationship while she wanted something eternal. 
Time passes and Titus eventually hears from Violet’s father. At Violet’s home, Titus sees her lying on a floating bed, completely pale, fully incapacitated, and covered in discs. Her father details her final, painful days and how her body failed. He then berates Titus for how badly he treated Violet and for willfully living in ignorance. Titus later visits Violet’s home a second time. Although she appears dead, her feed efficiency is at 4.6 percent and a screen shows that her heart is beating slightly. Nevertheless, Titus tells Violet a story he plans to keep telling her, he says, so she will remember herself. The story is about Violet, the end of America, and their relationship, where they learn something important about love and how to resist the feed. The book ends with a promotion on the feed for Blue-Jean Warehouse’s Final Sales Event and a recurring, fading message that “Everything must go.”"
Martin,"Part 1 alternates between the narrative and the letters Justyce McAllister, a black seventeen-year-old boy living in Atlanta, writes to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.—to whom he refers simply as “Martin”—in which he reflects on his life and explains how he tries to live more like Dr. King.
In the middle of the night, Justyce goes to rescue his ex-girlfriend, Melo Taylor, from driving home drunk. When the police arrive, Officer Castillo misreads the situation and puts Justyce in handcuffs using excessive force. Justyce is finally released with the help of Mrs. Friedman, a lawyer and the mother of his friend, Sarah-Jane, or SJ. In a Dear Martin letter, Justyce talks about being from a rough neighborhood, attending Braselton Preparatory Academy on full scholarship, and having plans to attend an Ivy League college. 
The brutal treatment he received from the police reminds Justyce of the recent police shooting of a black seventeen-year-old with a promising future. Hanging out with his best friend Manny Rivers, a wealthy, black Braselton Prep student, the two talk about Justyce’s on-and-off relationship with Melo. Over dinner, they learn that Manny’s cousin, Quan Banks, a gang member from Justyce’s neighborhood, has killed Officer Castillo. In class, Justyce, SJ, and Manny’s friend, Jared Christensen, both of whom are white, debate with their teacher and debate coach Dr. Jarius “Doc” Dray whether racial equality exists in America. Jared claims America is now color-blind.
On the weekend, Justyce goes to a Halloween party with Manny’s friends Jared, Kyle, and Blake. Jared suggests the boys dress as stereotypes. Justyce dresses as a thug and Blake as a Klansman. At the party, one of the Black Jihad, a gang from Justyce’s old neighborhood, punches Blake for his offensive costume and criticizes Manny and Justyce for hanging out with these white boys. Later, SJ and Justyce have a late-night conversation during which Justyce realizes how much he likes SJ. The next day, SJ celebrates Justyce’s acceptance at Yale University. In Doc’s class, Jared complains about affirmative action, claiming that an undeserving black student may have taken his spot at Yale. Later, Manny observes that SJ seems perfect for Justyce, but Justyce says his mother doesn’t want him to date a white girl. Manny confesses to being afraid of black girls because of his lack of exposure to them.
Some weeks later, Justyce and SJ win their debate tournament about racial profiling. Justyce then tries to kiss SJ, but she turns away. Confused, Justyce gets even more upset when he finds out that another black teen has been killed by the police. In reaction to these events, Justyce gets drunk and goes with Manny to Blake’s birthday party. Angered by their displays of racism, Justyce hits Blake and Jared. Justyce worries whites will only ever see his skin color and thinks his experiment to be like Martin Luther King Jr. has failed. 
Later, Doc visits a hungover Justyce in his dorm room. Justyce tells Doc about his alcoholic, abusive father, whom he doesn’t want to be like. Doc encourages Justyce to hold on to his value despite other people’s racism. A couple days later in Justyce’s dorm room, Manny says his eyes are now open to racism. He tells Justyce he has quit the basketball team and that he has hit Jared for a racist comment that Jared made. 
Later, Manny’s dad talks to the boys about the racism he experiences at work and his regret that he hadn’t better prepared Manny for racism. The next weekend, because Manny feels upset by Jared’s dad pressing assault charges against him, he and Justyce drive around, playing music loudly. Manny has an angry exchange about his music volume with a white driver, who turns out to be an off-duty police officer, Garrett Tison. The officer shouts a racial slur and fires three shots that injure Justyce and kill Manny.
In part 2, the narrative is interwoven with news reports. Disillusioned, Justyce stops writing his Dear Martin letters. After being released from the hospital, Justyce attends Manny’s funeral and reconnects with SJ. Newspaper articles follow the Tison case and report that Tison will stand trial for shooting Justyce and Manny. Justyce receives a free car. Manny’s parents give Justyce an heirloom watch in memory of Manny and tell him that Manny’s cousin Quan wants Justyce to visit him in juvenile detention. During Justyce’s visit, Quan explains the Black Man’s Curse and encourages Justyce to seek support from the Black Jihad. The media misrepresent Justyce as a “thug,” which angers SJ. Surprisingly, Jared wants to help correct the misguided impression of Justyce. Doc encourages Justyce to focus on the kind of man he wants to be, and SJ apologizes to Justyce for avoiding him.
Manny’s father is forced to step down from his corporate VP role because of his efforts to get justice for Manny and Justyce, and Manny’s parents decide to move. Feeling alone, Justyce visits the leader of the Black Jihad but decides not to join the gang. Instead, he goes to see SJ, and the two confess their feelings for each other. The news reports arson at Officer Tison’s home. After his graduation, the police question Justyce in connection with the fire because some Black Jihad have named Justyce as an accomplice. But Justyce has an alibi: He was with SJ’s family the night of the fire. 
When Justyce’s mother learns he’s dating a white girl, she becomes upset. At the trial for Manny’s murder, the defense attorney cross-examines Justyce, trying to paint Justyce and Manny as volatile and violent. The jury doesn’t reach a conclusion about the murder charges against Officer Tison. Before there can be a retrial, Tison is murdered in prison. Several weeks later, Justyce and SJ head to college. In a final Dear Martin letter, Justyce talks about being negatively judged by his college roommate. He also reflects on why his be-like-Martin experiment didn’t work. Justyce realizes he needs to figure out who he is and what he believes. Four months later, Justyce reconnects with Jared at Manny’s grave. The two talk about missing Manny, life at Yale, and what they plan to study. It’s clear Jared has changed and that a genuine friendship has begun between the two."
Leading,"Silas Marner is the weaver in the English countryside village of Raveloe in the early nineteenth century. Like many weavers of his time, he is an outsider—the object of suspicion because of his special skills and the fact that he has come to Raveloe from elsewhere. The villagers see Silas as especially odd because of the curious cataleptic fits he occasionally suffers. Silas has ended up in Raveloe because the members of his religious sect in Lantern Yard, an insular neighborhood in a larger town, falsely accused him of theft and excommunicated him.
	Much shaken after the accusation, Silas finds nothing familiar in Raveloe to reawaken his faith and falls into a numbing routine of solitary work. His one attempt at neighborliness backfires: when an herbal remedy he suggests for a neighbor’s illness works, he is rumored to be a sort of witch doctor. With little else to live for, Silas becomes infatuated with the money he earns for his work and hoards it, living off as little as possible. Every night he pulls his gold out from its hiding place beneath his floorboards to count it. He carries on in this way for fifteen years.
	Squire Cass is the wealthiest man in Raveloe, and his two eldest sons are Godfrey and Dunstan, or Dunsey. Dunsey is greedy and cruel, and enjoys tormenting Godfrey, the eldest son. Godfrey is good-natured but weak-willed, and, though secretly married to the opium addict Molly Farren, he is in love with Nancy Lammeter. Dunsey talked Godfrey into the marriage and repeatedly blackmails him with threats to reveal the marriage to their father. Godfrey gives Dunsey 100 pounds of the rent money paid to him by one of their father’s tenants. Godfrey then finds himself in a bind when Dunsey insists that Godfrey repay the sum himself. Dunsey once again threatens to reveal Godfrey’s marriage but, after some arguing, offers to sell Godfrey’s prize horse, Wildfire, to repay the loan.
	The next day, Dunsey meets with some friends who are hunting and negotiates the sale of the horse. Dunsey decides to participate in the hunt before finalizing the sale, and, in doing so, he has a riding accident that kills the horse. Knowing the rumors of Silas’s hoard, Dunsey makes plans to intimidate the weaver into lending him money. His walk home takes him by Silas’s cottage, and, finding the cottage empty, Dunsey steals the money instead.
	Silas returns from an errand to find his money gone. Overwhelmed by the loss, he runs to the local tavern for help and announces the theft to a sympathetic audience of tavern regulars. The theft becomes the talk of the village, and a theory arises that the thief might have been a peddler who came through the village some time before. Godfrey, meanwhile, is distracted by thoughts of Dunsey, who has not returned home. After hearing that Wildfire has been found dead, Godfrey decides to tell his father about the money, though not about his marriage. The Squire flies into a rage at the news, but does not do anything drastic to punish Godfrey.
	Silas is utterly disconsolate at the loss of his gold and numbly continues his weaving. Some of the townspeople stop by to offer their condolences and advice. Among these visitors, Dolly Winthrop stands out. Like many of the others, she encourages Silas to go to church—something he has not done since he was banished from Lantern Yard—but she is also gentler and more genuinely sympathetic.
	Nancy Lammeter arrives at Squire Cass’s famed New Year’s dance resolved to reject Godfrey’s advances because of his unsound character. However, Godfrey is more direct and insistent than he has been in a long time, and Nancy finds herself exhilarated by the evening in spite of her resolution. Meanwhile, Molly, Godfrey’s secret wife, is making her way to the Casses’ house to reveal the secret marriage. She has their daughter, a toddler, in her arms. Tiring after her long walk, Molly takes a draft of opium and passes out by the road. Seeing Silas’s cottage and drawn by the light of the fire, Molly’s little girl wanders through the open door and falls asleep at Silas’s hearth.
	Silas is having one of his fits at the time and does not notice the little girl enter his cottage. When he comes to, he sees her already asleep on his hearth, and is as stunned by her appearance as he was by the disappearance of his money. A while later, Silas traces the girl’s footsteps outside and finds Molly’s body lying in the snow. Silas goes to the Squire’s house to find the doctor, and causes a stir at the dance when he arrives with the baby girl in his arms. Godfrey, recognizing his daughter, accompanies the doctor to Silas’s cottage. When the doctor declares that Molly is dead, Godfrey realizes that his secret is safe. He does not claim his daughter, and Silas adopts her.
	Silas grows increasingly attached to the child and names her Eppie, after his mother and sister. With Dolly Winthrop’s help, Silas raises the child lovingly. Eppie begins to serve as a bridge between Silas and the rest of the villagers, who offer him help and advice and have come to think of him as an exemplary person because of what he has done. Eppie also brings Silas out of the benumbed state he fell into after the loss of his gold. In his newfound happiness, Silas begins to explore the memories of his past that he has long repressed.
	The novel jumps ahead sixteen years. Godfrey has married Nancy and Squire Cass has died. Godfrey has inherited his father’s house, but he and Nancy have no children. Their one daughter died at birth, and Nancy has refused to adopt. Eppie has grown into a pretty and spirited young woman, and Silas a contented father. The stone-pit behind Silas’s cottage is drained to water neighboring fields, and Dunsey’s skeleton is found at the bottom, along with Silas’s gold. The discovery frightens Godfrey, who becomes convinced that his own secrets are destined to be uncovered as well. He confesses the truth to Nancy about his marriage to Molly and fathering of Eppie. Nancy is not angry but regretful, saying that they could have adopted Eppie legitimately if Godfrey had told her earlier.
	That evening, Godfrey and Nancy decide to visit Silas’s cottage to confess the truth of Eppie’s lineage and claim her as their daughter. However, after hearing Godfrey and Nancy’s story, Eppie tells them she would rather stay with Silas than live with her biological father. Godfrey and Nancy leave, resigning themselves to helping Eppie from afar. The next day Silas decides to visit Lantern Yard to see if he was ever cleared of the theft of which he was accused years before. The town has changed almost beyond recognition, though, and Silas’s old chapel has been torn down to make way for a new factory. Silas realizes that his questions will never be answered, but he is content with the sense of faith he has regained through his life with Eppie. That summer Eppie is married to Aaron Winthrop, Dolly’s son. Aaron comes to live in Silas’s cottage, which has been expanded and refurbished at Godfrey’s expense."
Seared,"The Scarlet Letter opens with a long preamble about how the book came to be written. The nameless narrator was the surveyor of the customhouse in Salem, Massachusetts. In the customhouse’s attic, he discovered a number of documents, among them a manuscript that was bundled with a scarlet, gold-embroidered patch of cloth in the shape of an “A.” The manuscript, the work of a past surveyor, detailed events that occurred some two hundred years before the narrator’s time. When the narrator lost his customs post, he decided to write a fictional account of the events recorded in the manuscript. The Scarlet Letter is the final product.
The story begins in seventeenth-century Boston, then a Puritan settlement. A young woman, Hester Prynne, is led from the town prison with her infant daughter, Pearl, in her arms and the scarlet letter “A” on her breast. A man in the crowd tells an elderly onlooker that Hester is being punished for adultery. Hester’s husband, a scholar much older than she is, sent her ahead to America, but he never arrived in Boston. The consensus is that he has been lost at sea. While waiting for her husband, Hester has apparently had an affair, as she has given birth to a child. She will not reveal her lover’s identity, however, and the scarlet letter, along with her public shaming, is her punishment for her sin and her secrecy. On this day Hester is led to the town scaffold and harangued by the town fathers, but she again refuses to identify her child’s father.
The elderly onlooker is Hester’s missing husband, who is now practicing medicine and calling himself Roger Chillingworth. He settles in Boston, intent on revenge. He reveals his true identity to no one but Hester, whom he has sworn to secrecy. Several years pass. Hester supports herself by working as a seamstress, and Pearl grows into a willful, impish child. Shunned by the community, they live in a small cottage on the outskirts of Boston. Community officials attempt to take Pearl away from Hester, but, with the help of Arthur Dimmesdale, a young and eloquent minister, the mother and daughter manage to stay together. Dimmesdale, however, appears to be wasting away and suffers from mysterious heart trouble, seemingly caused by psychological distress. Chillingworth attaches himself to the ailing minister and eventually moves in with him so that he can provide his patient with round-the-clock care. Chillingworth also suspects that there may be a connection between the minister’s torments and Hester’s secret, and he begins to test Dimmesdale to see what he can learn. One afternoon, while the minister sleeps, Chillingworth discovers a mark on the man’s breast (the details of which are kept from the reader), which convinces him that his suspicions are correct.
Dimmesdale’s psychological anguish deepens, and he invents new tortures for himself. In the meantime, Hester’s charitable deeds and quiet humility have earned her a reprieve from the scorn of the community. One night, when Pearl is about seven years old, she and her mother are returning home from a visit to a deathbed when they encounter Dimmesdale atop the town scaffold, trying to punish himself for his sins. Hester and Pearl join him, and the three link hands. Dimmesdale refuses Pearl’s request that he acknowledge her publicly the next day, and a meteor marks a dull red “A” in the night sky. Hester can see that the minister’s condition is worsening, and she resolves to intervene. She goes to Chillingworth and asks him to stop adding to Dimmesdale’s self-torment. Chillingworth refuses.
Hester arranges an encounter with Dimmesdale in the forest because she is aware that Chillingworth has probably guessed that she plans to reveal his identity to Dimmesdale. The former lovers decide to flee to Europe, where they can live with Pearl as a family. They will take a ship sailing from Boston in four days. Both feel a sense of release, and Hester removes her scarlet letter and lets down her hair. Pearl, playing nearby, does not recognize her mother without the letter. The day before the ship is to sail, the townspeople gather for a holiday and Dimmesdale preaches his most eloquent sermon ever. Meanwhile, Hester has learned that Chillingworth knows of their plan and has booked passage on the same ship. Dimmesdale, leaving the church after his sermon, sees Hester and Pearl standing before the town scaffold. He impulsively mounts the scaffold with his lover and his daughter, and confesses publicly, exposing a scarlet letter seared into the flesh of his chest. He falls dead, as Pearl kisses him.
Frustrated in his revenge, Chillingworth dies a year later. Hester and Pearl leave Boston, and no one knows what has happened to them. Many years later, Hester returns alone, still wearing the scarlet letter, to live in her old cottage and resume her charitable work. She receives occasional letters from Pearl, who has married a European aristocrat and established a family of her own. When Hester dies, she is buried next to Dimmesdale. The two share a single tombstone, which bears a scarlet “A.”"
Extremely,"Oskar Schell, a nine-year-old boy, has not been happy since his dad died in the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Unbeknownst to anyone except for Oskar, on the day of the attacks, Oskar’s dad called the house five times. Oskar was home for the fifth call but couldn’t bring himself to pick up the phone. They never recovered his dad’s body and buried an empty casket at his funeral. Oskar is furious that his mom has started to spend time with a man named Ron and worries that she has begun to move on. Oskar suffers from extreme anxiety and imagines whimsical inventions in order to cope. One night, he decides to look through his dad’s closet and sees a vase hidden on the top shelf. In trying to retrieve it, Oskar drops the vase, and when it shatters, he finds an envelope labeled “Black” that contains a strange key. After doing some research, Oskar decides to visit every person with the last name Black in New York City to try and discover what the key opens.
There is also a parallel storyline about Oskar’s grandparents. The novel includes letters from Oskar’s grandpa, Thomas, to his dad, and letters that his grandma writes to him. Thomas stops speaking not long after immigrating to America out of grief for Anna, his lost love who died in the bombing of Dresden. Thomas communicates by writing one-line sentences in notebooks. He explains that Grandma, Anna’s sister whose name we never learn, encountered him in a bakery and asked him to marry her. Grandma writes her own version of their meeting, which doesn’t quite match up with Thomas’s account. According to Grandma, when she reunited with Thomas, he asked her to pose for a sculpture. She agreed and started going to his apartment daily to pose. Although he started touching her for longer and longer in order to get her into the position he wanted, the sculpture still looked like Anna. Eventually, they had sex, and Grandma proposed. Throughout their marriage, they divide up their apartment into “Nothing” places, where they can go to not exist, and “Something” places. However, the lines blur. After Grandma becomes pregnant, Thomas leaves for Dresden because he doesn’t want to keep living any longer.
Early in Oskar’s search for the key, he meets Abby Black, an epidemiologist who lives in Greenwich Village. Throughout their conversation, he hears a man yelling from the next room, but Abby ignores him. Abby claims to know nothing about the key, but Oskar notices she seems to hold something back. Nevertheless, his search continues alphabetically down his list of people named Black. He eventually meets a man only referred to as Mr. Black, who lives in the apartment right above Oskar’s. Mr. Black is 103 years old, very wise, and hard of hearing. Oskar invites him to join him in the quest for the key, but Mr. Black hasn’t left the house in the twenty-three years since his wife’s death, and he’s turned off his hearing aids. He allows Oskar to turn his hearing aids back on. From then on, Mr. Black accompanies Oskar on his travels through the city, encouraging Oskar to get over his fear of public transportation. After they meet with Ruth Black, who lives in the Empire State Building, Mr. Black tells Oskar he’s done searching for the lock. Oskar is devastated.
Thomas returns to New York after 9/11 with a desire to try and live again. Grandma at first wants him neither to stay nor leave, but she eventually allows him to stay in the guestroom. She makes him promise never to let Oskar know he’s there. After Thomas sees Oskar for the first time, he starts following him around from a distance. Mr. Black eventually confronts Thomas and tries to protect Oskar. When Thomas explains who he is, Mr. Black tells him that he should be the one going around with Oskar. Not long after, Oskar finds Thomas in Grandma’s apartment and assumes him to be Grandma’s mysterious renter. Oskar tells Thomas the story of the key and plays him the messages his dad left on the answering machine. Thomas tells Oskar if he ever needs him to toss stones at his window. Oskar later asks Thomas to help him dig up his dad’s grave. Thomas agrees, and they bury Thomas’s unsent letters to his son in the grave. Afterward, Thomas tries to leave Grandma again, but she follows him to the airport. He doesn’t want to stay or leave, so they stay there, writing.
Not long after Oskar meets Thomas, he notices that there has been a single message on his family’s answering machine for months. He listens to it and discovers that Abby Black called him because she had information about the key. He returns to her house and learns that the key belongs to her ex-husband, William. Furthermore, Oskar’s mom knew about Oskar’s key quest all along and had called Abby Black, along with many of the other Blacks, to tell them Oskar was going to be coming. Confused and frustrated, Oskar goes to William's office. William explains that the key unlocks a safety deposit box that William’s deceased father left for him. William didn’t realize the key was in the vase until after he’d sold the vase to Oskar’s dad at an estate sale. Disappointed that the key had nothing to do with his dad, Oskar goes home. He formulates a plan to dig up his dad’s grave. He looks at a series of photographs he has of a man falling from the World Trade Center. He reorders the photographs so that the man floats back up and imagines his last night with his dad playing out in reverse."
Prelude,"The epic’s prelude offers a general introduction to Gilgamesh, king of Uruk, who was two-thirds god and one-third man. He built magnificent ziggurats, or temple towers, surrounded his city with high walls, and laid out its orchards and fields. He was physically beautiful, immensely strong, and very wise. Although Gilgamesh was godlike in body and mind, he began his kingship as a cruel despot. He lorded over his subjects, raping any woman who struck his fancy, whether she was the wife of one of his warriors or the daughter of a nobleman. He accomplished his building projects with forced labor, and his exhausted subjects groaned under his oppression. The gods heard his subjects’ pleas and decided to keep Gilgamesh in check by creating a wild man named Enkidu, who was as magnificent as Gilgamesh. Enkidu became Gilgamesh’s great friend, and Gilgamesh’s heart was shattered when Enkidu died of an illness inflicted by the gods. Gilgamesh then traveled to the edge of the world and learned about the days before the deluge and other secrets of the gods, and he recorded them on stone tablets.
The epic begins with Enkidu. He lives with the animals, suckling at their breasts, grazing in the meadows, and drinking at their watering places. A hunter discovers him and sends a temple prostitute into the wilderness to tame him. In that time, people considered women and sex calming forces that could domesticate wild men like Enkidu and bring them into the civilized world. When Enkidu sleeps with the woman, the animals reject him since he is no longer one of them. Now, he is part of the human world. Then the harlot teaches him everything he needs to know to be a man. Enkidu is outraged by what he hears about Gilgamesh’s excesses, so he travels to Uruk to challenge him. When he arrives, Gilgamesh is about to force his way into a bride’s wedding chamber. Enkidu steps into the doorway and blocks his passage. The two men wrestle fiercely for a long time, and Gilgamesh finally prevails. After that, they become friends and set about looking for an adventure to share. 
Gilgamesh and Enkidu decide to steal trees from a distant cedar forest forbidden to mortals. A terrifying demon named Humbaba, the devoted servant of Enlil, the god of earth, wind, and air, guards it. The two heroes make the perilous journey to the forest, and, standing side by side, fight with the monster. With assistance from Shamash the sun god, they kill him. Then they cut down the forbidden trees, fashion the tallest into an enormous gate, make the rest into a raft, and float on it back to Uruk. Upon their return, Ishtar, the goddess of love, is overcome with lust for Gilgamesh. Gilgamesh spurns her. Enraged, the goddess asks her father, Anu, the god of the sky, to send the Bull of Heaven to punish him. The bull comes down from the sky, bringing with him seven years of famine. Gilgamesh and Enkidu wrestle with the bull and kill it. The gods meet in council and agree that one of the two friends must be punished for their transgression, and they decide Enkidu is going to die. He takes ill, suffers immensely, and shares his visions of the underworld with Gilgamesh. When he finally dies, Gilgamesh is heartbroken.
Gilgamesh can’t stop grieving for Enkidu, and he can’t stop brooding about the prospect of his own death. Exchanging his kingly garments for animal skins as a way of mourning Enkidu, he sets off into the wilderness, determined to find Utnapishtim, the Mesopotamian Noah. After the flood, the gods had granted Utnapishtim eternal life, and Gilgamesh hopes that Utnapishtim can tell him how he might avoid death too. Gilgamesh’s journey takes him to the twin-peaked mountain called Mashu, where the sun sets into one side of the mountain at night and rises out of the other side in the morning. Utnapishtim lives beyond the mountain, but the two scorpion monsters that guard its entrance refuse to allow Gilgamesh into the tunnel that passes through it. Gilgamesh pleads with them, and they relent. 
After a harrowing passage through total darkness, Gilgamesh emerges into a beautiful garden by the sea. There he meets Siduri, a veiled tavern keeper, and tells her about his quest. She warns him that seeking immortality is futile and that he should be satisfied with the pleasures of this world. However, when she can’t turn him away from his purpose, she directs him to Urshanabi, the ferryman. Urshanabi takes Gilgamesh on the boat journey across the sea and through the Waters of Death to Utnapishtim. Utnapishtim tells Gilgamesh the story of the flood—how the gods met in council and decided to destroy humankind. Ea, the god of wisdom, warned Utnapishtim about the gods’ plans and told him how to fashion a gigantic boat in which his family and the seed of every living creature might escape. When the waters finally receded, the gods regretted what they’d done and agreed that they would never try to destroy humankind again. Utnapishtim was rewarded with eternal life. Men would die, but humankind would continue. 
When Gilgamesh insists that he be allowed to live forever, Utnapishtim gives him a test. If you think you can stay alive for eternity, he says, surely you can stay awake for a week. Gilgamesh tries and immediately fails. So Utnapishtim orders him to clean himself up, put on his royal garments again, and return to Uruk where he belongs. Just as Gilgamesh is departing, however, Utnapishtim’s wife convinces him to tell Gilgamesh about a miraculous plant that restores youth. Gilgamesh finds the plant and takes it with him, planning to share it with the elders of Uruk. But a snake steals the plant one night while they are camping. As the serpent slithers away, it sheds its skin and becomes young again. 
When Gilgamesh returns to Uruk, he is empty-handed but reconciled at last to his mortality. He knows that he can’t live forever but that humankind will. Now he sees that the city he had repudiated in his grief and terror is a magnificent, enduring achievement—the closest thing to immortality to which a mortal can aspire."
Above,"Matilda Cook is a fourteen-year-old girl living in Philadelphia in 1793. Matilda’s mother, Lucille, manages the coffeehouse, and they live above the shop with Grandfather, Matilda’s deceased father’s father, who fought in the war. Matilda dreams of one day owning her own shops and traveling to Paris, but for now she helps Mother in the coffeehouse, where she is often berated for being too slow or too lazy. The coffeehouse’s cook, Eliza, is a formerly enslaved Black woman whose husband died before she could buy him his freedom. Matilda and her family also have a serving girl, Polly, who was Matilda’s childhood friend. One day, Polly fails show up at the coffeehouse. Mother goes to see where Polly is and comes back with news that Polly died from a sudden fever. Matilda feels very sad and asks to see Polly’s family or go to her funeral, but Mother doesn’t want Matilda going anywhere near a house that could contain sick people.
As Matilda serves the customers in the coffeehouse, she hears them talking about a new disease spreading around the city, and some believe it is yellow fever. More and more people continue to catch the disease and die. Mother considers sending Matilda to the Ludington family’s farm, where she will be farther away from the disease, but Matilda doesn’t want to leave. However, not long after, Mother becomes ill with the fever and insists that Matilda leave her so that she will not get sick as well. Matilda and Grandfather leave Philadelphia with a farmer and his wife to go to the Ludington farm. Grandfather begins coughing on the journey and blames it on the heat. But when the wagon is stopped by several men who are monitoring who goes in and out of the local town, the men hear Grandfather’s coughing and refuse to let him pass. The farmer leaves Grandfather and Matilda behind on the road several miles outside Philadelphia.
Matilda and Grandfather rest in the shade of a tree while Matilda thinks about what to do next. She gathers water for them to drink at a stream and collects berries for them to eat. Grandfather seems weak and at times disoriented but does not show any signs of yellow fever. After trying to find food from local farmers, Matilda returns to Grandfather and collapses. She wakes up several days later in a hospital and learns that she has yellow fever, but Grandfather does not. He explains that his recent cough was caused by heart problems. While Matilda recovers, a clerk tells her that she should go live at the orphan house since she cannot find Mother, but Grandfather protests, insisting that he’ll take care of Matilda.
Once Matilda is fully recovered, she and Grandfather return to Philadelphia. They find that the city has changed very much since they departed. Many businesses have closed. Empty houses are boarded up to prevent thieves from breaking in. When Grandfather and Matilda return to their coffeehouse, they see that it has been broken into and all of their food and several possessions have been stolen. Matilda finds some food in the withered garden and cares for Grandfather. One night, two men break into the house while Matilda is sleeping on the first floor. Matilda hides, but the men soon realize she’s there. They trap her and try to make her tell them where she’s hidden her money. Woken by the noise, Grandfather comes downstairs with his rifle and shoots. One of the men attacks Grandfather, but Matilda stabs the man in the shoulder with Grandfather’s sword, which the men had planned to steal. The men leave when Matilda threatens to kill them. Grandfather, who was knocked back by the shot of the rifle and who has already been having heart troubles, dies. Matilda brings his body outside to be buried in a mass grave the next day.
On her way home from overseeing Grandfather’s burial, Matilda sees a young girl crying. She learns that the girl’s name is Nell and that Nell’s mother is dead. While trying to find someone to take in Nell, Matilda sees Eliza in the distance and follows her until she catches up. Eliza allows Matilda and Nell to stay with her and her brother Joseph’s family. Matilda becomes attached to Nell but knows she’s not ready to take care of a child, so Matilda brings Nell to the orphan house. However, after the woman at the orphan house says they can’t take in any more children, Matilda brings Nell back to Eliza’s brother’s house, secretly relieved.
Matilda begins helping Eliza with her volunteer work for the Free African Society, caring for patients with yellow fever. One day, Matilda and Eliza return home to find that Joseph’s sons and Nell have the fever. Knowing the children need to get out of the heat to survive, Matilda and Eliza bring the children to the coffeehouse, where it is cooler. The first frost soon arrives, an event that people believe will bring an end to the epidemic. The children eventually recover.
After the epidemic ends, Matilda reopens the coffeehouse with Eliza as her partner and begins spending more time with a local painter’s apprentice, Nathaniel Benson. One day, Nathaniel comes in the coffeehouse to announce that President Washington has returned to Philadelphia. Everyone rushes outside to catch a glimpse of the president. On their way back to the coffeehouse, a carriage arrives and Matilda’s mother steps out. Mother left for the Ludington farm shortly after Matilda and Grandfather did and tried to track them down when she realized they were not there, which only made her weaker. She recovered at the Ludingtons’ and returned to Philadelphia as soon as she could. With Mother needing more rest than before, Matilda continues running the coffeehouse and caring for Nell as the city moves on from the epidemic."
The,"Jack Worthing, the play’s protagonist, is a pillar of the community in Hertfordshire, where he is guardian to Cecily Cardew, the pretty, eighteen-year-old granddaughter of the late Thomas Cardew, who found and adopted Jack when he was a baby. In Hertfordshire, Jack has responsibilities: he is a major landowner and justice of the peace, with tenants, farmers, and a number of servants and other employees all dependent on him. For years, he has also pretended to have an irresponsible black-sheep brother named Ernest who leads a scandalous life in pursuit of pleasure and is always getting into trouble of a sort that requires Jack to rush grimly off to his assistance. In fact, Ernest is merely Jack’s alibi, a phantom that allows him to disappear for days at a time and do as he likes. No one but Jack knows that he himself is Ernest. Ernest is the name Jack goes by in London, which is where he really goes on these occasions—probably to pursue the very sort of behavior he pretends to disapprove of in his imaginary brother.
Jack is in love with Gwendolen Fairfax, the cousin of his best friend, Algernon Moncrieff. When the play opens, Algernon, who knows Jack as Ernest, has begun to suspect something, having found an inscription inside Jack’s cigarette case addressed to “Uncle Jack” from someone who refers to herself as “little Cecily.” Algernon suspects that Jack may be leading a double life, a practice he seems to regard as commonplace and indispensable to modern life. He calls a person who leads a double life a “Bunburyist,” after a nonexistent friend he pretends to have, a chronic invalid named Bunbury, to whose deathbed he is forever being summoned whenever he wants to get out of some tiresome social obligation.
At the beginning of Act 1, Jack drops in unexpectedly on Algernon and announces that he intends to propose to Gwendolen. Algernon confronts him with the cigarette case and forces him to come clean, demanding to know who “Jack” and “Cecily” are. Jack confesses that his name isn’t really Ernest and that Cecily is his ward, a responsibility imposed on him by his adoptive father’s will. Jack also tells Algernon about his fictional brother. Jack says he’s been thinking of killing off this fake brother, since Cecily has been showing too active an interest in him. Without meaning to, Jack describes Cecily in terms that catch Algernon’s attention and make him even more interested in her than he is already.
Gwendolen and her mother, Lady Bracknell, arrive, which gives Jack an opportunity to propose to Gwendolen. Jack is delighted to discover that Gwendolen returns his affections, but he is alarmed to learn that Gwendolen is fixated on the name Ernest, which she says “inspires absolute confidence.” Gwendolen makes clear that she would not consider marrying a man who was not named Ernest.
Lady Bracknell interviews Jack to determine his eligibility as a possible son-in-law, and during this interview she asks about his family background. When Jack explains that he has no idea who his parents were and that he was found, by the man who adopted him, in a handbag in the cloakroom at Victoria Station, Lady Bracknell is scandalized. She forbids the match between Jack and Gwendolen and sweeps out of the house.
In Act 2, Algernon shows up at Jack’s country estate posing as Jack’s brother Ernest. Meanwhile, Jack, having decided that Ernest has outlived his usefulness, arrives home in deep mourning, full of a story about Ernest having died suddenly in Paris. He is enraged to find Algernon there masquerading as Ernest but has to go along with the charade. If he doesn’t, his own lies and deceptions will be revealed.
While Jack changes out of his mourning clothes, Algernon, who has fallen hopelessly in love with Cecily, asks her to marry him. He is surprised to discover that Cecily already considers that they are engaged, and he is charmed when she reveals that her fascination with “Uncle Jack’s brother” led her to invent an elaborate romance between herself and him several months ago. Algernon is less enchanted to learn that part of Cecily’s interest in him derives from the name Ernest, which, unconsciously echoing Gwendolen, she says “inspires absolute confidence.”
Algernon goes off in search of Dr. Chasuble, the local rector, to see about getting himself christened Ernest. Meanwhile, Gwendolen arrives, having decided to pay Jack an unexpected visit. Gwendolen is shown into the garden, where Cecily orders tea and attempts to play hostess. Cecily has no idea how Gwendolen figures into Jack’s life, and Gwendolen, for her part, has no idea who Cecily is. Gwendolen initially thinks Cecily is a visitor to the Manor House and is disconcerted to learn that Cecily is “Mr. Worthing’s ward.” She notes that Ernest has never mentioned having a ward, and Cecily explains that it is not Ernest Worthing who is her guardian but his brother Jack and, in fact, that she is engaged to be married to Ernest Worthing. Gwendolen points out that this is impossible as she herself is engaged to Ernest Worthing. The tea party degenerates into a war of manners.
Jack and Algernon arrive toward the climax of this confrontation, each having separately made arrangements with Dr. Chasuble to be christened Ernest later that day. Each of the young ladies points out that the other has been deceived: Cecily informs Gwendolen that her fiancé is really named Jack and Gwendolen informs Cecily that hers is really called Algernon. The two women demand to know where Jack’s brother Ernest is, since both of them are engaged to be married to him. Jack is forced to admit that he has no brother and that Ernest is a complete fiction. Both women are shocked and furious, and they retire to the house arm in arm.
Act 3 takes place in the drawing room of the Manor House, where Cecily and Gwendolen have retired. When Jack and Algernon enter from the garden, the two women confront them. Cecily asks Algernon why he pretended to be her guardian’s brother. Algernon tells her he did it in order to meet her. Gwendolen asks Jack whether he pretended to have a brother in order to come into London to see her as often as possible, and she interprets his evasive reply as an affirmation. The women are somewhat appeased but still concerned over the issue of the name. However, when Jack and Algernon tell Gwendolen and Cecily that they have both made arrangements to be christened Ernest that afternoon, all is forgiven and the two pairs of lovers embrace. At this moment, Lady Bracknell’s arrival is announced.
Lady Bracknell has followed Gwendolen from London, having bribed Gwendolen’s maid to reveal her destination. She demands to know what is going on. Gwendolen again informs Lady Bracknell of her engagement to Jack, and Lady Bracknell reiterates that a union between them is out of the question. Algernon tells Lady Bracknell of his engagement to Cecily, prompting her to inspect Cecily and inquire into her social connections, which she does in a routine and patronizing manner that infuriates Jack. He replies to all her questions with a mixture of civility and sarcasm, withholding until the last possible moment the information that Cecily is actually worth a great deal of money and stands to inherit still more when she comes of age. At this, Lady Bracknell becomes genuinely interested.
Jack informs Lady Bracknell that, as Cecily’s legal guardian, he refuses to give his consent to her union with Algernon. Lady Bracknell suggests that the two young people simply wait until Cecily comes of age, and Jack points out that under the terms of her grandfather’s will, Cecily does not legally come of age until she is thirty-five. Lady Bracknell asks Jack to reconsider, and he points out that the matter is entirely in her own hands. As soon as she consents to his marriage to Gwendolen, Cecily can have his consent to marry Algernon. However, Lady Bracknell refuses to entertain the notion. She and Gwendolen are on the point of leaving when Dr. Chasuble arrives and happens to mention Cecily’s governess, Miss Prism. At this, Lady Bracknell starts and asks that Miss Prism be sent for.
When the governess arrives and catches sight of Lady Bracknell, she begins to look guilty and furtive. Lady Bracknell accuses her of having left her sister’s house twenty-eight years before with a baby and never returned. She demands to know where the baby is. Miss Prism confesses she doesn’t know, explaining that she lost the baby, having absentmindedly placed it in a handbag in which she had meant to place the manuscript for a novel she had written. Jack asks what happened to the bag, and Miss Prism says she left it in the cloakroom of a railway station. Jack presses her for further details and goes racing offstage, returning a few moments later with a large handbag. When Miss Prism confirms that the bag is hers, Jack throws himself on her with a cry of “Mother!” It takes a while before the situation is sorted out, but before too long we understand that Jack is not the illegitimate child of Miss Prism but the legitimate child of Lady Bracknell’s sister and, therefore, Algernon’s older brother. Furthermore, Jack had been originally christened “Ernest John.” All these years Jack has unwittingly been telling the truth: Ernest is his name, as is Jack, and he does have an unprincipled younger brother—Algernon. Again the couples embrace, Miss Prism and Dr. Chasuble follow suit, and Jack acknowledges that he now understands “the vital Importance of Being Earnest.”"
Disease,"Matilda Cook is a fourteen-year-old girl living in Philadelphia in 1793.

Expresses,"Hercule Poirot, private detective and retired Belgian police officer, boards the Taurus Express train to Stamboul (Istanbul). On the train there are two other passengers, Mary Debenham and Colonel Arbuthnot. The two act as if they are strangers, but Poirot observes behavior that suggests that they are not. Poirot is suspicious of the couple. The train arrives in Stamboul and Poirot checks in at the Tokatlian Hotel. As soon as Poirot arrives he receives a telegram summoning him back to London. While waiting at the hotel for the next train, Poirot bumps into an old friend, M. Bouc, head of the Wagon Lit. M. Bouc arranges a space for Poirot on the Orient Express. In the dining room of the Tokatlian Hotel, Poirot first spots Ratchett and Hector McQueen eating dinner. Poirot know that Ratchett is an evil man and he describes him to M. Bouc as an animal.
Poirot board the Orient Express. He is forced to ride in a second-class cabin because the train is unusually full. Ratchett and Hector McQueen are also aboard the train. Ratchett approaches Poirot and asks if he will work for him, Ratchett tells Poirot he has been receiving threatening letters and that someone is trying to kill him. Poirot refuses the case. M. Bouc has taken the last first class cabin, but arranges to be moved to a separate coach and gives Poirot his space in first class. The first night Poirot sleeps in first class, he observes some strange occurrences. Early in the morning, Poirot is wakened by a cry from Ratchett's compartment next to him. The wagon lit conductor responds knocks on Ratchett's door and a voice from inside responds, ""Ce n'est rien. Je me suis trompe"" (It is nothing. I am mistaken). Poirot has difficulty sleeping because there is a peculiar silence on the train. Mrs. Hubbard rings her bell and tells the conductor a man is in her room. Poirot rings his bell for water and is informed by the conductor that the train is stuck in a snow bank. Poirot hears a loud thump next door.
The next morning, the train still stopped, M. Bouc informs Poirot that Ratchett has been murdered and the murderer is still aboard the train. Poirot tells M. Bouc he will investigate the case. Poirot first examines Ratchett's body and compartment. Ratchett has twelve stab wounds. The window is left open in Ratchett's compartment, presumably to make the investigators think the murderer escaped out the window, but there are no footprints outside the window in the snow. A handkerchief with the initial ""H"" is found in the compartment, a pipe cleaner, a round match different from the matches Ratchett used and a charred piece of paper with the name ""Armstrong"" on it.
The piece of paper with the word Armstrong on it helps Poirot figure out who Ratchett really is and why someone would want to murder him. A few years back, a man named Cassetti kidnapped a three-year old girl, Daisy Armstrong. Cassetti collected a ransom from the wealthy Armstrong family, but killed the child anyways. Poirot concludes that Ratchett is Cassetti.
The interviews start with the Wagon Lit conductor, then Hector McQueen. Poirot knows that McQueen is involved with the case because he knows about the Armstrong note found in Ratchett's compartment, Hector is surprised that Poirot found the note because he thought it had been completely destroyed. He interviews Masterman and then Mrs. Hubbard. Mrs. Hubbard claims that the murderer was in her cabin. All of the passengers give Poirot suitable alibis during their interviews, although a few suspicious elements are brought to light: many passengers observed a woman in a red kimono walking down the hallway the night of the murder, but no one admits they have a red kimono. Mrs. Hubbard tells Poirot she had Greta Ohlsson lock the communicating door between she and Ratchett. Hildegarde Schmidt bumped into a stranger wearing a Wagon Lit jacket.
Poirot checks every passenger's luggage. During the check he notices a few interesting things: the label on Countess Andrenyi's luggage is wet, a Wagon Lit uniform is found in Hildegarde Schmidt's bag and, lastly, the red kimono is found in Poirot's own luggage.
After the luggage check, Poirot, Dr. Constantine and M. Bouc review the facts of the case and develop a list of questions. With the evidence and questions in mind, Poirot sits and thinks about the case. When he surfaces from a somewhat trance-like state, Poirot has discovered the solution to the case. Before he reveals this solution in full, he calls in several people and reveals their true identities. Poirot discovers Countess Andrenyi is Helena Goldenberg, aunt of Daisy Armstrong. She wet her luggage label and obscured her name, in an effort to conceal her identity. Also, Mary Debenham was Daisy's governess, Antonio Foscanelli was the Armstrong's chaffer, Masterman the valet, and Greta Ohlsson was Daisy Armstrong's nurse. Princess Dragomiroff claims her handkerchief from Poirot, the same found in Ratchett's compartment.
Poirot gathers all of the passengers into the dining car and propounds two possible solutions. The fist solution is that a stranger entered the train at Vincovci and killed Ratchett. The second solution is that all of the passengers aboard the Orient Express were involved with the murder. He argues that twelve of the thirteen passengers, all close to the Armstrong case, killed Ratchett to avenge the murder of Daisy Armstrong. Mrs. Hubbard, revealed as Linda Arden, admits that the second solution is correct. Poirot suggests that M. Bouc and Dr. Constantine tell the police that the first solution is correct to protect the family. M. Bouc and Dr. Constantine accept Poirot's suggestion."
Patronized,"Jack Worthing, the play’s protagonist, is a pillar of the community in Hertfordshire, where he is guardian to Cecily Cardew, the pretty, eighteen-year-old granddaughter of the late Thomas Cardew, who found and adopted Jack when he was a baby. In Hertfordshire, Jack has responsibilities: he is a major landowner and justice of the peace, with tenants, farmers, and a number of servants and other employees all dependent on him. For years, he has also pretended to have an irresponsible black-sheep brother named Ernest who leads a scandalous life in pursuit of pleasure and is always getting into trouble of a sort that requires Jack to rush grimly off to his assistance. In fact, Ernest is merely Jack’s alibi, a phantom that allows him to disappear for days at a time and do as he likes. No one but Jack knows that he himself is Ernest. Ernest is the name Jack goes by in London, which is where he really goes on these occasions—probably to pursue the very sort of behavior he pretends to disapprove of in his imaginary brother.
Jack is in love with Gwendolen Fairfax, the cousin of his best friend, Algernon Moncrieff. When the play opens, Algernon, who knows Jack as Ernest, has begun to suspect something, having found an inscription inside Jack’s cigarette case addressed to “Uncle Jack” from someone who refers to herself as “little Cecily.” Algernon suspects that Jack may be leading a double life, a practice he seems to regard as commonplace and indispensable to modern life. He calls a person who leads a double life a “Bunburyist,” after a nonexistent friend he pretends to have, a chronic invalid named Bunbury, to whose deathbed he is forever being summoned whenever he wants to get out of some tiresome social obligation.
At the beginning of Act 1, Jack drops in unexpectedly on Algernon and announces that he intends to propose to Gwendolen. Algernon confronts him with the cigarette case and forces him to come clean, demanding to know who “Jack” and “Cecily” are. Jack confesses that his name isn’t really Ernest and that Cecily is his ward, a responsibility imposed on him by his adoptive father’s will. Jack also tells Algernon about his fictional brother. Jack says he’s been thinking of killing off this fake brother, since Cecily has been showing too active an interest in him. Without meaning to, Jack describes Cecily in terms that catch Algernon’s attention and make him even more interested in her than he is already.
Gwendolen and her mother, Lady Bracknell, arrive, which gives Jack an opportunity to propose to Gwendolen. Jack is delighted to discover that Gwendolen returns his affections, but he is alarmed to learn that Gwendolen is fixated on the name Ernest, which she says “inspires absolute confidence.” Gwendolen makes clear that she would not consider marrying a man who was not named Ernest.
Lady Bracknell interviews Jack to determine his eligibility as a possible son-in-law, and during this interview she asks about his family background. When Jack explains that he has no idea who his parents were and that he was found, by the man who adopted him, in a handbag in the cloakroom at Victoria Station, Lady Bracknell is scandalized. She forbids the match between Jack and Gwendolen and sweeps out of the house.
In Act 2, Algernon shows up at Jack’s country estate posing as Jack’s brother Ernest. Meanwhile, Jack, having decided that Ernest has outlived his usefulness, arrives home in deep mourning, full of a story about Ernest having died suddenly in Paris. He is enraged to find Algernon there masquerading as Ernest but has to go along with the charade. If he doesn’t, his own lies and deceptions will be revealed.
While Jack changes out of his mourning clothes, Algernon, who has fallen hopelessly in love with Cecily, asks her to marry him. He is surprised to discover that Cecily already considers that they are engaged, and he is charmed when she reveals that her fascination with “Uncle Jack’s brother” led her to invent an elaborate romance between herself and him several months ago. Algernon is less enchanted to learn that part of Cecily’s interest in him derives from the name Ernest, which, unconsciously echoing Gwendolen, she says “inspires absolute confidence.”
Algernon goes off in search of Dr. Chasuble, the local rector, to see about getting himself christened Ernest. Meanwhile, Gwendolen arrives, having decided to pay Jack an unexpected visit. Gwendolen is shown into the garden, where Cecily orders tea and attempts to play hostess. Cecily has no idea how Gwendolen figures into Jack’s life, and Gwendolen, for her part, has no idea who Cecily is. Gwendolen initially thinks Cecily is a visitor to the Manor House and is disconcerted to learn that Cecily is “Mr. Worthing’s ward.” She notes that Ernest has never mentioned having a ward, and Cecily explains that it is not Ernest Worthing who is her guardian but his brother Jack and, in fact, that she is engaged to be married to Ernest Worthing. Gwendolen points out that this is impossible as she herself is engaged to Ernest Worthing. The tea party degenerates into a war of manners.
Jack and Algernon arrive toward the climax of this confrontation, each having separately made arrangements with Dr. Chasuble to be christened Ernest later that day. Each of the young ladies points out that the other has been deceived: Cecily informs Gwendolen that her fiancé is really named Jack and Gwendolen informs Cecily that hers is really called Algernon. The two women demand to know where Jack’s brother Ernest is, since both of them are engaged to be married to him. Jack is forced to admit that he has no brother and that Ernest is a complete fiction. Both women are shocked and furious, and they retire to the house arm in arm.
Act 3 takes place in the drawing room of the Manor House, where Cecily and Gwendolen have retired. When Jack and Algernon enter from the garden, the two women confront them. Cecily asks Algernon why he pretended to be her guardian’s brother. Algernon tells her he did it in order to meet her. Gwendolen asks Jack whether he pretended to have a brother in order to come into London to see her as often as possible, and she interprets his evasive reply as an affirmation. The women are somewhat appeased but still concerned over the issue of the name. However, when Jack and Algernon tell Gwendolen and Cecily that they have both made arrangements to be christened Ernest that afternoon, all is forgiven and the two pairs of lovers embrace. At this moment, Lady Bracknell’s arrival is announced.
Lady Bracknell has followed Gwendolen from London, having bribed Gwendolen’s maid to reveal her destination. She demands to know what is going on. Gwendolen again informs Lady Bracknell of her engagement to Jack, and Lady Bracknell reiterates that a union between them is out of the question. Algernon tells Lady Bracknell of his engagement to Cecily, prompting her to inspect Cecily and inquire into her social connections, which she does in a routine and patronizing manner that infuriates Jack. He replies to all her questions with a mixture of civility and sarcasm, withholding until the last possible moment the information that Cecily is actually worth a great deal of money and stands to inherit still more when she comes of age. At this, Lady Bracknell becomes genuinely interested.
Jack informs Lady Bracknell that, as Cecily’s legal guardian, he refuses to give his consent to her union with Algernon. Lady Bracknell suggests that the two young people simply wait until Cecily comes of age, and Jack points out that under the terms of her grandfather’s will, Cecily does not legally come of age until she is thirty-five. Lady Bracknell asks Jack to reconsider, and he points out that the matter is entirely in her own hands. As soon as she consents to his marriage to Gwendolen, Cecily can have his consent to marry Algernon. However, Lady Bracknell refuses to entertain the notion. She and Gwendolen are on the point of leaving when Dr. Chasuble arrives and happens to mention Cecily’s governess, Miss Prism. At this, Lady Bracknell starts and asks that Miss Prism be sent for.
When the governess arrives and catches sight of Lady Bracknell, she begins to look guilty and furtive. Lady Bracknell accuses her of having left her sister’s house twenty-eight years before with a baby and never returned. She demands to know where the baby is. Miss Prism confesses she doesn’t know, explaining that she lost the baby, having absentmindedly placed it in a handbag in which she had meant to place the manuscript for a novel she had written. Jack asks what happened to the bag, and Miss Prism says she left it in the cloakroom of a railway station. Jack presses her for further details and goes racing offstage, returning a few moments later with a large handbag. When Miss Prism confirms that the bag is hers, Jack throws himself on her with a cry of “Mother!” It takes a while before the situation is sorted out, but before too long we understand that Jack is not the illegitimate child of Miss Prism but the legitimate child of Lady Bracknell’s sister and, therefore, Algernon’s older brother. Furthermore, Jack had been originally christened “Ernest John.” All these years Jack has unwittingly been telling the truth: Ernest is his name, as is Jack, and he does have an unprincipled younger brother—Algernon. Again the couples embrace, Miss Prism and Dr. Chasuble follow suit, and Jack acknowledges that he now understands “the vital Importance of Being Earnest.”"
Convenient,"Irene Redfield is a light-skinned Black woman who, in public places, occasionally passes for white, when she finds it convenient. Irene is a practical, determined person. She was born and raised in Chicago but now lives in Harlem with her husband, Brian, and their two boys. Brian is a successful doctor but dislikes his work. He would have preferred to move the entire family to another, less racist country long ago, but Irene has always insisted that the family belongs in New York.
One day, while back in Chicago for a visit, Irene has a chance meeting with a childhood friend, Clare. Clare is very different from Irene—self-centered, melodramatic, and reckless. Clare is even lighter-skinned than Irene, and in fact she has married a white man, John Bellew, without telling him that she is Black. They have a daughter. The Bellews live mostly in Europe but often spend time in the Unites States, depending on where John Bellew’s work in international banking takes him. Irene finds Clare strangely fascinating but does not like her company. She only reluctantly agrees to visit Clare at the Bellews’ hotel suite. Clare has invited a mutual light-skinned friend of theirs to join them. When John Bellew arrives, Irene is shocked to learn that he is a vehement racist. He openly declares that he hates Black people, not knowing that he is speaking to three of them.
Two years later, the Bellews have relocated to New York. Clare resumes contact with Irene, and Irene is not firm enough to insist that Clare leave her alone, if only to keep Clare’s secret safe. When Clare learns that Irene is planning a charity event at which upper-class Black people and white people will mingle, Clare insists on attending. Soon, she is at the Redfields’ home regularly and has become part of their social circle. In time, Irene suspects that Clare and Brian are having an affair. The Bellews are due to move back to Europe soon, but a chance downtown encounter between John Bellew and Irene, while Irene is with a darker-skinned friend, creates a crisis. If Bellew deduces that Clare, like Irene, is Black, he may divorce Clare and leave her free to pursue Brian.
The threat that Clare poses for Irene’s marriage and family life is unexpectedly removed when Bellew tracks Clare down at an all-Black party hosted by friends of the Redfields in their apartment atop a high residential building. Bellew angrily confronts Clare, but Clare smiles and acts unconcerned. When Irene angrily moves toward Clare and puts her hand on Clare’s arm, Clare tumbles out a nearby open window, to her death. The cause of her fall is unclear—whether she fainted and fell by accident, or fell deliberately. It is also possible that Irene pushed Clare, but no one accuses her."
1776,"In Common Sense, Thomas Paine argues for American independence. His argument begins with more general, theoretical reflections about government and religion, then progresses onto the specifics of the colonial situation.
Paine begins by distinguishing between government and society. Society, according to Paine, is everything constructive and good that people join together to accomplish. Government, on the other hand, is an institution whose sole purpose is to protect us from our own vices. Government has its origins in the evil of man and is therefore a necessary evil at best. Paine says that government's sole purpose is to protect life, liberty and property, and that a government should be judged solely on the basis of the extent to which it accomplishes this goal.
Paine then considers an imagined scenario in which a small group of people has been placed on an island, and cut off from the rest of society. In time, these people develop ties with one another, and lawmaking becomes inevitable. Paine says the people will be much happier if they are responsible for the creation of the laws that rule them. Paine is also implicitly arguing that such a system of representation is also better for the American colonists. Having expressed his disagreement with British reign in America, Paine proceeds to launch a general attack on the British system of government. Paine says the British system is too complex and rife with contradictions, and that the monarchy is granted far too much power. The British system pretends to offer a reasonable system of checks and balances, but in fact, it does not.
From here Paine moves on to discuss, in general, the notions of monarchy and hereditary succession. Man, Pain argues, was born into a state of equality, and the distinction that has arisen between king and subject is an unnatural one. At first, Paine says, the world was without kings, but the ancient Jews decided they wanted a king. This angered God, but he allowed them to have one. Paine presents pages of biblical evidence detailing God's wrath at the idea of the Jews having a king. The conclusion Paine reaches is that the practice of monarchy originates from sin, and is an institution that the Bible and God condemn. Paine calls hereditary succession an abominable practice. He says that even if people were to choose to have a king, that does not legitimize that King's child acting as a future ruler. Furthermore, hereditary succession has brought with it innumerable evils, such as incompetent kings, corruption, and civil war.
Having dispensed with the preliminary theoretical issues, Paine sets in to discuss the details of the American situation. In response to the argument that America has flourished under British rule, and therefore ought to stay under the king, Paine says that such an argument fails to realize that America has evolved and no longer needs Britain's help. Some say that Britain has protected America, and therefore deserves allegiance, but Paine responds that Britain has only watched over America in order to secure its own economic well-being. Paine adds that most recently, instead of watching over the colonies, the British have been attacking them, and are therefore undeserving of American loyalty.
Paine says that the colonies have little to gain from remaining attached to Britain. Commerce can be better conducted with the rest of Europe, but only after America becomes independent. Paine also asserts that if the colonies remain attached to Britain, the same problems that have arisen in the past will arise in the future. Paine argues that it is necessary to seek independence now, as to do otherwise would only briefly cover up problems that will surely reemerge.
Paine even proposes the form of government that the independent colonies should adopt. His recommendation is for a representative democracy that gives roughly equal weight to each of the colonies.
Paine explains why the current time is a good time to break free of Britain. Primarily, Paine focuses on the present size of the colonies, and on their current capabilities. He presents an inventory of the British Navy and gives calculations revealing how America could build a navy of comparable size. Paine recommends this as a way of ensuring America's security and prosperity in trade. Paine also argues that America is sufficiently small as to be united now. If time were to elapse, and the population of the colonies to grow, the same feeling of unity would not be present. Paine adds that if the Americans revolt now, they can use the vast expanses of uncharted land to the West in order to pay down some of the debt they will incur.
Paine says that as a colony of Britain, America lacks respectability on the international scene. They are seen simply as rebels, and cannot form substantial alliances with other nations. In order to prosper in the long term, the colonies need to be independent. Paine says that, by declaring independence, America will be able to ask for the help of other countries in its struggle for freedom. For all of these reasons, Paine says it is imperative and urgent that the colonies declare independence."
Apparent,"Meursault, the narrator, is a young man living in Algiers. After receiving a telegram informing him of his mother’s death, he takes a bus to Marengo, where his mother had been living in an old persons’ home. He sleeps for almost the entire trip. When he arrives, he speaks to the director of the home. The director allows Meursault to see his mother, but Meursault finds that her body has already been sealed in the coffin. He declines the caretaker’s offer to open the coffin.
That night, Meursault keeps vigil over his mother’s body. Much to his displeasure, the talkative caretaker stays with him the whole time. Meursault smokes a cigarette, drinks coffee, and dozes off. The next morning, before the funeral, he meets with the director again. The director informs him that Thomas Perez, an old man who had grown very close to Meursault’s mother, will be attending the funeral service. The funeral procession heads for the small local village, but Perez has difficulty keeping up and eventually faints from the heat. Meursault reports that he remembers little of the funeral. That night, he happily arrives back in Algiers.
The next day, Meursault goes to the public beach for a swim. There, he runs into Marie Cardona, his former co-worker. The two make a date to see a comedy at the movie theater that evening. After the movie they spend the night together. When Meursault wakes up, Marie is gone. He stays in bed until noon and then sits on his balcony until evening, watching the people pass on the street.
The following day, Monday, Meursault returns to work. He has lunch with his friend Emmanuel and then works all afternoon. While walking upstairs to his apartment that night, Meursault runs into Salamano, an old man who lives in his building and owns a mangy dog. Meursault also runs into his neighbor, Raymond Sintes, who is widely rumored to be a pimp. Raymond invites Meursault over for dinner. Over the meal, Raymond recounts how he beat up his mistress after he discovered that she had been cheating on him. As a result, he got into a fight with her brother. Raymond now wants to torment his mistress even more, but he needs Meursault to write a letter to lure his mistress back to him. Meursault agrees and writes the letter that night.
The following Saturday, Marie visits Meursault at his apartment. She asks Meursault if he loves her, and he replies that “it didn’t mean anything,” but probably not. The two then hear shouting coming from Raymond’s apartment. They go out into the hall and watch as a policeman arrives. The policeman slaps Raymond and says that he will be summoned to the police station for beating up his mistress. Later, Raymond asks Meursault to testify on his behalf, and Meursault agrees. That night, Raymond runs into Salamano, who laments that his dog has run away.
Marie asks Meursault if he wants to marry her. He replies indifferently but says that they can get married if she wants to, so they become engaged. The following Sunday, Meursault, Marie, and Raymond go to a beach house owned by Masson, one of Raymond’s friends. They swim happily in the ocean and then have lunch. That afternoon, Masson, Raymond, and Meursault run into two Arabs on the beach, one of whom is the brother of Raymond’s mistress. A fight breaks out and Raymond is stabbed. After tending to his wounds, Raymond returns to the beach with Meursault. They find the Arabs at a spring. Raymond considers shooting them with his gun, but Meursault talks him out of it and takes the gun away. Later, however, Meursault returns to the spring to cool off, and, for no apparent reason, he shoots Raymond’s mistress’s brother.
Meursault is arrested and thrown into jail. His lawyer seems disgusted at Meursault’s lack of remorse over his crime, and, in particular, at Meursault’s lack of grief at his mother’s funeral. Later, Meursault meets with the examining magistrate, who cannot understand Meursault’s actions. The magistrate brandishes a crucifix and demands that Meursault put his faith in God. Meursault refuses, insisting that he does not believe in God. The magistrate cannot accept Meursault’s lack of belief, and eventually dubs him “Monsieur Antichrist.”
One day, Marie visits Meursault in prison. She forces herself to smile during the visit, and she expresses hope that Meursault will be acquitted and that they will get married. As he awaits his trial, Meursault slowly adapts to prison life. His isolation from nature, women, and cigarettes torments him at first, but he eventually adjusts to living without them, and soon does not even notice their absence. He manages to keep his mind occupied, and he sleeps for most of each day.
Meursault is taken to the courthouse early on the morning of his trial. Spectators and members of the press fill the courtroom. The subject of the trial quickly shifts away from the murder to a general discussion of Meursault’s character, and of his reaction to his mother’s death in particular. The director and several other people who attended the vigil and the funeral are called to testify, and they all attest to Meursault’s lack of grief or tears. Marie reluctantly testifies that the day after his mother’s funeral she and Meursault went on a date and saw a comedic movie. During his summation the following day, the prosecutor calls Meursault a monster and says that his lack of moral feeling threatens all of society. Meursault is found guilty and is sentenced to death by beheading.
Meursault returns to prison to await his execution. He struggles to come to terms with his situation, and he has trouble accepting the certainty and inevitability of his fate. He imagines escaping and he dreams of filing a successful legal appeal. One day, the chaplain comes to visit against Meursault’s wishes. He urges Meursault to renounce his atheism and turn to God, but Meursault refuses. Like the magistrate, the chaplain cannot believe that Meursault does not long for faith and the afterlife. Meursault suddenly becomes enraged, grabs the chaplain, and begins shouting at him. He declares that he is correct in believing in a meaningless, purely physical world. For the first time, Meursault truly embraces the idea that human existence holds no greater meaning. He abandons all hope for the future and accepts the “gentle indifference of the world.” This acceptance makes Meursault feel happy."
Clerks,"General Prologue
At the Tabard Inn, a tavern in Southwark, near London, the narrator joins a company of twenty-nine pilgrims. The pilgrims, like the narrator, are traveling to the shrine of the martyr Saint Thomas Becket in Canterbury. The narrator gives a descriptive account of twenty-seven of these pilgrims, including a Knight, Squire, Yeoman, Prioress, Monk, Friar, Merchant, Clerk, Man of Law, Franklin, Haberdasher, Carpenter, Weaver, Dyer, Tapestry-Weaver, Cook, Shipman, Physician, Wife, Parson, Plowman, Miller, Manciple, Reeve, Summoner, Pardoner, and Host. (He does not describe the Second Nun or the Nun’s Priest, although both characters appear later in the book.)
The Host, whose name, we find out in the Prologue to the Cook’s Tale, is Harry Bailey, suggests that the group ride together and entertain one another with stories. He decides that each pilgrim will tell two stories on the way to Canterbury and two on the way back. Whomever he judges to be the best storyteller will receive a meal at Bailey’s tavern, courtesy of the other pilgrims. The pilgrims draw lots and determine that the Knight will tell the first tale.
The Knight’s Tale
Theseus, duke of Athens, imprisons Arcite and Palamon, two knights from Thebes (another city in ancient Greece). From their prison, the knights see and fall in love with Theseus’s sister-in-law, Emelye. Through the intervention of a friend, Arcite is freed, but he is banished from Athens. He returns in disguise and becomes a page in Emelye’s chamber. Palamon escapes from prison, and the two meet and fight over Emelye. Theseus apprehends them and arranges a tournament between the two knights and their allies, with Emelye as the prize. Arcite wins, but he is accidentally thrown from his horse and dies. Palamon then marries Emelye.
The Miller’s Prologue and Tale
The Host asks the Monk to tell the next tale, but the drunken Miller interrupts and insists that his tale should be the next. He tells the story of an impoverished student named Nicholas, who persuades his landlord’s sexy young wife, Alisoun, to spend the night with him. He convinces his landlord, a carpenter named John, that the second flood is coming, and tricks him into spending the night in a tub hanging from the ceiling of his barn. Absolon, a young parish clerk who is also in love with Alisoun, appears outside the window of the room where Nicholas and Alisoun lie together.
When Absolon begs Alisoun for a kiss, she sticks her rear end out the window in the dark and lets him kiss it. Absolon runs and gets a red-hot poker, returns to the window, and asks for another kiss; when Nicholas sticks his bottom out the window and farts, Absolon brands him on the buttocks. Nicholas’s cries for water make the carpenter think that the flood has come, so the carpenter cuts the rope connecting his tub to the ceiling, falls down, and breaks his arm.
The Reeve’s Prologue and Tale
Because he also does carpentry, the Reeve takes offense at the Miller’s tale of a stupid carpenter, and counters with his own tale of a dishonest miller. The Reeve tells the story of two students, John and Alayn, who go to the mill to watch the miller grind their corn, so that he won’t have a chance to steal any. But the miller unties their horse, and while they chase it, he steals some of the flour he has just ground for them. By the time the students catch the horse, it is dark, so they spend the night in the miller’s house. That night, Alayn seduces the miller’s daughter, and John seduces his wife. When the miller wakes up and finds out what has happened, he tries to beat the students. His wife, thinking that her husband is actually one of the students, hits the miller over the head with a staff. The students take back their stolen goods and leave.
The Cook’s Prologue and Tale
The Cook particularly enjoys the Reeve’s Tale, and offers to tell another funny tale. The tale concerns an apprentice named Perkyn who drinks and dances so much that he is called “Perkyn Reveler.” Finally, Perkyn’s master decides that he would rather his apprentice leave to revel than stay home and corrupt the other servants. Perkyn arranges to stay with a friend who loves drinking and gambling, and who has a wife who is a prostitute. The tale breaks off, unfinished, after fifty-eight lines.
The Man of Law’s Introduction, Prologue, Tale, and Epilogue
The Host reminds his fellow pilgrims to waste no time, because lost time cannot be regained. He asks the Man of Law to tell the next tale. The Man of Law agrees, apologizing that he cannot tell any suitable tale that Chaucer has not already told—Chaucer may be unskilled as a poet, says the Man of Law, but he has told more stories of lovers than Ovid, and he doesn’t print tales of incest as John Gower does (Gower was a contemporary of Chaucer). In the Prologue to his tale, the Man of Law laments the miseries of poverty. He then remarks how fortunate merchants are, and says that his tale is one told to him by a merchant.
In the tale, the Muslim sultan of Syria converts his entire sultanate (including himself) to Christianity in order to persuade the emperor of Rome to give him his daughter, Custance, in marriage. The sultan’s mother and her attendants remain secretly faithful to Islam. The mother tells her son she wishes to hold a banquet for him and all the Christians. At the banquet, she massacres her son and all the Christians except for Custance, whom she sets adrift in a rudderless ship. After years of floating, Custance runs ashore in Northumberland, where a constable and his wife, Hermengyld, offer her shelter. She converts them to Christianity.
One night, Satan makes a young knight sneak into Hermengyld’s chamber and murder Hermengyld. He places the bloody knife next to Custance, who sleeps in the same chamber. When the constable returns home, accompanied by Alla, the king of Northumberland, he finds his slain wife. He tells Alla the story of how Custance was found, and Alla begins to pity the girl. He decides to look more deeply into the murder. Just as the knight who murdered Hermengyld is swearing that Custance is the true murderer, he is struck down and his eyes burst out of his face, proving his guilt to Alla and the crowd. The knight is executed, Alla and many others convert to Christianity, and Custance and Alla marry.
While Alla is away in Scotland, Custance gives birth to a boy named Mauricius. Alla’s mother, Donegild, intercepts a letter from Custance to Alla and substitutes a counterfeit one that claims that the child is disfigured and bewitched. She then intercepts Alla’s reply, which claims that the child should be kept and loved no matter how malformed. Donegild substitutes a letter saying that Custance and her son are banished and should be sent away on the same ship on which Custance arrived. Alla returns home, finds out what has happened, and kills Donegild.
After many adventures at sea, including an attempted rape, Custance ends up back in Rome, where she reunites with Alla, who has made a pilgrimage there to atone for killing his mother. She also reunites with her father, the emperor. Alla and Custance return to England, but Alla dies after a year, so Custance returns, once more, to Rome. Mauricius becomes the next Roman emperor.
Following the Man of Law’s Tale, the Host asks the Parson to tell the next tale, but the Parson reproaches him for swearing, and they fall to bickering.
The Wife of Bath’s Prologue and Tale
The Wife of Bath gives a lengthy account of her feelings about marriage. Quoting from the Bible, the Wife argues against those who believe it is wrong to marry more than once, and she explains how she dominated and controlled each of her five husbands. She married her fifth husband, Jankyn, for love instead of money. After the Wife has rambled on for a while, the Friar butts in to complain that she is taking too long, and the Summoner retorts that friars are like flies, always meddling. The Friar promises to tell a tale about a summoner, and the Summoner promises to tell a tale about a friar. The Host cries for everyone to quiet down and allow the Wife to commence her tale.
In her tale, a young knight of King Arthur’s court rapes a maiden; to atone for his crime, Arthur’s queen sends him on a quest to discover what women want most. An ugly old woman promises the knight that she will tell him the secret if he promises to do whatever she wants for saving his life. He agrees, and she tells him women want control of their husbands and their own lives. They go together to Arthur’s queen, and the old woman’s answer turns out to be correct. The old woman then tells the knight that he must marry her. When the knight confesses later that he is repulsed by her appearance, she gives him a choice: she can either be ugly and faithful, or beautiful and unfaithful. The knight tells her to make the choice herself, and she rewards him for giving her control of the marriage by rendering herself both beautiful and faithful.
The Friar’s Prologue and Tale
The Friar speaks approvingly of the Wife of Bath’s Tale, and offers to lighten things up for the company by telling a funny story about a lecherous summoner. The Summoner does not object, but he promises to pay the Friar back in his own tale. The Friar tells of an archdeacon who carries out the law without mercy, especially to lechers. The archdeacon has a summoner who has a network of spies working for him, to let him know who has been lecherous.
The summoner extorts money from those he’s sent to summon, charging them more money than he should for penance. He tries to serve a summons on a yeoman who is actually a devil in disguise. After comparing notes on their treachery and extortion, the devil vanishes, but when the summoner tries to prosecute an old wealthy widow unfairly, the widow cries out that the summoner should be taken to hell. The devil follows the woman’s instructions and drags the summoner off to hell.
The Summoner’s Prologue and Tale
The Summoner, furious at the Friar’s Tale, asks the company to let him tell the next tale. First, he tells the company that there is little difference between friars and fiends, and that when an angel took a friar down to hell to show him the torments there, the friar asked why there were no friars in hell; the angel then pulled up Satan’s tail and 20,000 friars came out of his ass.
In the Summoner’s Tale, a friar begs for money from a dying man named Thomas and his wife, who have recently lost their child. The friar shamelessly exploits the couple’s misfortunes to extract money from them, so Thomas tells the friar that he is sitting on something that he will bequeath to the friars. The friar reaches for his bequest, and Thomas lets out an enormous fart. The friar complains to the lord of the manor, whose squire promises to divide the fart evenly among all the friars.
The Clerk’s Prologue and Tale
The Host asks the Clerk to cheer up and tell a merry tale, and the Clerk agrees to tell a tale by the Italian poet Petrarch. Griselde is a hardworking peasant who marries into the aristocracy. Her husband tests her fortitude in several ways, including pretending to kill her children and divorcing her. He punishes her one final time by forcing her to prepare for his wedding to a new wife. She does all this dutifully, her husband tells her that she has always been and will always be his wife (the divorce was a fraud), and they live happily ever after.
The Merchant’s Prologue, Tale, and Epilogue
The Merchant reflects on the great difference between the patient Griselde of the Clerk’s Tale and the horrible shrew he has been married to for the past two months. The Host asks him to tell a story of the evils of marriage, and he complies. Against the advice of his friends, an old knight named January marries May, a beautiful young woman. She is less than impressed by his enthusiastic sexual efforts, and conspires to cheat on him with his squire, Damien. When blind January takes May into his garden to copulate with her, she tells him she wants to eat a pear, and he helps her up into the pear tree, where she has sex with Damien. Pluto, the king of the faeries, restores January’s sight, but May, caught in the act, assures him that he must still be blind. The Host prays to God to keep him from marrying a wife like the one the Merchant describes.
The Squire’s Introduction and Tale
The Host calls upon the Squire to say something about his favorite subject, love, and the Squire willingly complies. King Cambyuskan of the Mongol Empire is visited on his birthday by a knight bearing gifts from the king of Arabia and India. He gives Cambyuskan and his daughter Canacee a magic brass horse, a magic mirror, a magic ring that gives Canacee the ability to understand the language of birds, and a sword with the power to cure any wound it creates. She rescues a dying female falcon that narrates how her consort abandoned her for the love of another. The Squire’s Tale is either unfinished by Chaucer or is meant to be interrupted by the Franklin, who interjects that he wishes his own son were as eloquent as the Squire. The Host expresses annoyance at the Franklin’s interruption, and orders him to begin the next tale.
The Franklin’s Prologue and Tale
The Franklin says that his tale is a familiar Breton lay, a folk ballad of ancient Brittany. Dorigen, the heroine, awaits the return of her husband, Arveragus, who has gone to England to win honor in feats of arms. She worries that the ship bringing her husband home will wreck itself on the coastal rocks, and she promises Aurelius, a young man who falls in love with her, that she will give her body to him if he clears the rocks from the coast. Aurelius hires a student learned in magic to create the illusion that the rocks have disappeared. Arveragus returns home and tells his wife that she must keep her promise to Aurelius. Aurelius is so impressed by Arveragus’s honorable act that he generously absolves her of the promise, and the magician, in turn, generously absolves Aurelius of the money he owes.
The Physician’s Tale
Appius the judge lusts after Virginia, the beautiful daughter of Virginius. Appius persuades a churl named Claudius to declare her his slave, stolen from him by Virginius. Appius declares that Virginius must hand over his daughter to Claudius. Virginius tells his daughter that she must die rather than suffer dishonor, and she virtuously consents to her father’s cutting her head off. Appius sentences Virginius to death, but the Roman people, aware of Appius’s hijinks, throw him into prison, where he kills himself.
The Pardoner’s Introduction, Prologue, and Tale
The Host is dismayed by the tragic injustice of the Physician’s Tale, and asks the Pardoner to tell something merry. The other pilgrims contradict the Host, demanding a moral tale, which the Pardoner agrees to tell after he eats and drinks. The Pardoner tells the company how he cheats people out of their money by preaching that money is the root of all evil. His tale describes three riotous youths who go looking for Death, thinking that they can kill him. An old man tells them that they will find Death under a tree. Instead, they find eight bushels of gold, which they plot to sneak into town under cover of darkness.
The youngest goes into town to fetch food and drink, but brings back poison, hoping to have the gold all to himself. His companions kill him to enrich their own shares, then drink the poison and die under the tree. His tale complete, the Pardoner offers to sell the pilgrims pardons, and singles out the Host to come kiss his relics. The Host infuriates the Pardoner by accusing him of fraud, but the Knight persuades the two to kiss and bury their differences.
The Shipman’s Tale
The Shipman’s Tale features a monk who tricks a merchant’s wife into having sex with him by borrowing money from the merchant, then giving it to the wife so she can repay her own debt to her husband, in exchange for sexual favors. When the monk sees the merchant next, he tells him that he returned the merchant’s money to his wife. The wife realizes she has been duped, but she boldly tells her husband to forgive her debt: she will repay it in bed. The Host praises the Shipman’s story, and asks the Prioress for a tale.
The Prioress’s Prologue and Tale
The Prioress calls on the Virgin Mary to guide her tale. In an Asian city, a Christian school is located at the edge of a Jewish ghetto. An angelic seven-year-old boy, a widow’s son, attends the school. He is a devout Christian, and loves to sing Alma Redemptoris (Gracious Mother of the Redeemer). Singing the song on his way through the ghetto, some Jews hire a murderer to slit his throat and throw him into a latrine. The Jews refuse to tell the widow where her son is, but he miraculously begins to sing Alma Redemptoris, so the Christian people recover his body, and the magistrate orders the murdering Jews to be drawn apart by wild horses and then hanged.
The Prologue and Tale of Sir Thopas
The Host, after teasing Chaucer the narrator about his appearance, asks him to tell a tale. Chaucer says that he only knows one tale, then launches into a parody of bad poetry—the Tale of Sir Thopas. Sir Thopas rides about looking for an elf-queen to marry until he is confronted by a giant. The narrator’s doggerel continues in this vein until the Host can bear no more and interrupts him. Chaucer asks him why he can’t tell his tale, since it is the best he knows, and the Host explains that his rhyme isn’t worth a turd. He encourages Chaucer to tell a prose tale.
The Tale of Melibee
Chaucer’s second tale is the long, moral prose story of Melibee. Melibee’s house is raided by his foes, who beat his wife, Prudence, and severely wound his daughter, Sophie, in her feet, hands, ears, nose, and mouth. Prudence advises him not to rashly pursue vengeance on his enemies, and he follows her advice, putting his foes’ punishment in her hands. She forgives them for the outrages done to her, in a model of Christian forbearance and forgiveness.
The Monk’s Prologue and Tale
The Host wishes that his own wife were as patient as Melibee’s, and calls upon the Monk to tell the next tale. First he teases the Monk, pointing out that the Monk is clearly no poor cloisterer. The Monk takes it all in stride and tells a series of tragic falls, in which noble figures are brought low: Lucifer, Adam, Sampson, Hercules, Nebuchadnezzar, Belshazzar, Zenobia, Pedro of Castile, and down through the ages.
The Nun’s Priest’s Prologue, Tale, and Epilogue
After seventeen noble “falls” narrated by the Monk, the Knight interrupts, and the Host calls upon the Nun’s Priest to deliver something more lively. The Nun’s Priest tells of Chanticleer the Rooster, who is carried off by a flattering fox who tricks him into closing his eyes and displaying his crowing abilities. Chanticleer turns the tables on the fox by persuading him to open his mouth and brag to the barnyard about his feat, upon which Chanticleer falls out of the fox’s mouth and escapes. The Host praises the Nun’s Priest’s Tale, adding that if the Nun’s Priest were not in holy orders, he would be as sexually potent as Chanticleer.
The Second Nun’s Prologue and Tale
In her Prologue, the Second Nun explains that she will tell a saint’s life, that of Saint Cecilia, for this saint set an excellent example through her good works and wise teachings. She focuses particularly on the story of Saint Cecilia’s martyrdom. Before Cecilia’s new husband, Valerian, can take her virginity, she sends him on a pilgrimage to Pope Urban, who converts him to Christianity. An angel visits Valerian, who asks that his brother Tiburce be granted the grace of Christian conversion as well. All three—Cecilia, Tiburce, and Valerian—are put to death by the Romans.
The Canon’s Yeoman’s Prologue and Tale
When the Second Nun’s Tale is finished, the company is overtaken by a black-clad Canon and his Yeoman, who have heard of the pilgrims and their tales and wish to participate. The Yeoman brags to the company about how he and the Canon create the illusion that they are alchemists, and the Canon departs in shame at having his secrets discovered. The Yeoman tells a tale of how a canon defrauded a priest by creating the illusion of alchemy using sleight of hand.
The Manciple’s Prologue and Tale
The Host pokes fun at the Cook, riding at the back of the company, blind drunk. The Cook is unable to honor the Host’s request that he tell a tale, and the Manciple criticizes him for his drunkenness. The Manciple relates the legend of a white crow, taken from the Roman poet Ovid’s Metamorphoses and one of the tales in The Arabian Nights. In it, Phoebus’s talking white crow informs him that his wife is cheating on him. Phoebus kills the wife, pulls out the crow’s white feathers, and curses it with blackness.
The Parson’s Prologue and Tale
As the company enters a village in the late afternoon, the Host calls upon the Parson to give them a fable. Refusing to tell a fictional story because it would go against the rule set by St. Paul, the Parson delivers a lengthy treatise on the Seven Deadly Sins, instead.
Chaucer’s Retraction
Chaucer appeals to readers to credit Jesus Christ as the inspiration for anything in his book that they like, and to attribute what they don’t like to his own ignorance and lack of ability. He retracts and prays for forgiveness for all of his works dealing with secular and pagan subjects, asking only to be remembered for what he has written of saints’ lives and homilies."
Successes,"In Outliers: The Story of Success, Malcolm Gladwell considers the circumstances that lead to success. The first half of the book looks closely at how opportunities matter more in the lives of successful people than hard work or raw talent. The second half of the book focuses on cultural legacies: behavioral tendencies rooted in their ancestral past.
Part One examines the role of opportunity in the lives of extremely successful people. Gladwell’s first example is the Canadian Hockey League, the world’s most competitive youth hockey league. Since the cutoff date for the Canadian leagues that serve the youngest players is January 1, those born in the first part of the calendar year are much larger and more coordinated than their peers. The larger and more coordinated kids are given more playing time and better coaching, and thus become better players by the time they reach the top league. An overwhelming majority of Canadian professional hockey players have birthdays in January, February or March.
Gladwell proposes that 10,000 hours of practice is needed to master a skill, even for prodigies like Mozart. Bill Joy, Bill Gates, and the Beatles all worked hard to achieve success but benefited from opportunities they did not create. Joy, one of the founders of Sun Microsystems, happened to attend one of the first colleges in the world with a time-sharing terminal. In graduate school, he had a terminal in his room, where he spent all of his free time programming. Gates happened to attend a private high school with a time-sharing terminal connected to a mainframe in Seattle. He also was able to spend all of his free time programming. Early on, the Beatles were hired to play long shows day after day in Hamburg, Germany. 
Birth year or era is another form of opportunity. Gates and Joy (as well as other early programmers) all reached the end of their teen years just as personal computers became available to the public. In another example, fourteen of the top seventy-five richest people in the history of the world happened to be alive at the same time, in the same country: the United States in the mid-1800s.
Opportunity matters more than an individual’s IQ. Using a study conducted by Lewis Terman, the creator of the Stanford-Binet IQ test, Gladwell shows that “practical intelligence” is as important as “analytical intelligence.” He also contrasts Chris Langan, one of the world’s smartest living people, with Robert Oppenheimer. While both had difficulties in college, only Oppenheimer had a successful life, due to his practical intelligence.
The last portion of Part One looks at Joe Flom, a successful lawyer from New York City. While he was born into a poor family to Jewish immigrants (in a time when Jewish immigrants were not treated well), many of the disadvantages in his life were actually benefits and directly contributed to his success.
Part Two investigates cultural legacies. Using flight recorder transcripts from several plane crashes from the last few decades, Gladwell shows that cultural expectations and habits can be a severe hindrance to pilots. Copilots from countries that have a high “Power Distance Index” (those that show the most deference to authority) will often avoid telling pilots that they are making mistakes, even when the mistakes are potentially fatal. After recognizing the dangers of such cultural expectations, commercial aviation has instituted programs to change the way flight crews talk with one another. 
Gladwell next analyzes the disparity in public school math test scores between Eastern and Western countries. He suggests that the cultures in which rice paddy farming is historically important have a stronger work ethic. Using various examples, Gladwell shows that hard work has a greater impact on success in learning mathematics than intelligence. 
The final example is an examination of the KIPP school in the South Bronx and the “achievement gap” between socioeconomic groups. American students from middle-class and affluent households retain more information over summer vacation and are more likely to make additional gains than students from low-income households. The KIPP school uses longer school days and summer programming to eliminate the achievement gap for low-income children. While the work schedule is very rigorous, the school’s students go on to great academic success.
Gladwell demonstrates that if more opportunities were available, there would be far more successful people and the world would be richer for it."
Advocate,"Lawyer Bryan Stevenson gives a first-person account of his decades helping marginalized Americans who have been unfairly and harshly punished by the U.S. criminal justice system, which disproportionately targets people of color and poor people. At the heart of Just Mercy is the story of Walter McMillian, a Black man who was framed for the murder of a girl named Ronda Morrison, convicted, and sent to death row. 
Stevenson alternates chapters about Walter with his personal reflections on our country’s history with racial disparity and issues around incarceration. Stevenson highlights other groups of vulnerable people who have been victimized by the criminal justice system and shares the stories of the prisoners he has helped over the years. The book also follows the growth of Stevenson’s nonprofit law project, the Alabama-based Equal Justice Initiative (EJI), through its expansion from focusing on death row prisoners to helping people sentenced to life without parole. Stevenson chronicles how EJI becomes a significant force in criminal justice reform.
In 1983 as a law student, Stevenson discovers his life’s passion when he interns with the Georgia-based Southern Prisoners Defense Committee and meets his first death row prisoner. After graduation Stevenson accepts a job with the organization to represent poor prisoners, including those in Alabama who lack any public defender. He meets Walter McMillian on Alabama’s death row. Walter owns a successful business but also transgresses racial boundaries when he has an affair with a white woman. Soon after the affair becomes public, the woman’s friend, Ralph Myers, accuses Walter of committing the unsolved murder of Ronda Morrison, which has outraged the community. Law enforcement, including a racist sheriff and the district attorney, eagerly pounces on this accusation, overlooking Walter’s alibi and a lack of evidence. Instead, they actively force Ralph to stick with his story even when he tries to recant. They coerce other false witness testimonies, and—as revealed years later—actively suppress evidence.
After Stevenson and the team at EJI unsuccessfully appeal Walter’s conviction, they launch their own investigation of the crime and uncover new evidence. They find witnesses who can prove the witnesses against Walter lied as well as financial records that indicate that one of these witnesses was paid to give false testimony. Stevenson and his team also petition for and receive all records from Walter’s trial. However, their big break comes when they receive a phone call from Ralph, who now wants to make amends. Ralph admits to lying about Walter and says he was threatened by law enforcement. Stevenson wins a hearing for Walter where he can present his new evidence: Ralph’s testimony, which is confirmed by health care workers and other inmates, as well as recordings of the law enforcement team threatening Ralph if he doesn’t frame Walter. 
While the judge refuses to grant Walter relief, Stevenson continues the appeal process through the Alabama courts. The district attorney asks outside agents to investigate the murder for which Walter was convicted, and the investigators determine that Walter had nothing to do with the crime. Six weeks later, the court invalidates Walter’s conviction. Stevenson and the State file a joint motion to dismiss the charges, and Walter is set free.
Throughout the process, Stevenson and Walter become close friends, and Stevenson helps Walter upon his release, including filing a civil suit on his behalf and offering him a place to stay. Walter works with Stevenson to share his story, giving interviews and speaking at legal conferences, and Walter is even featured in a documentary. Unfortunately, Walter is diagnosed with advancing dementia and is forced to rely on family and eventually a nursing facility for his care. He dies in 2013. Stevenson gives a eulogy at his funeral and shares all he learned from Walter, particularly that we must extend mercy to everyone, even those who have not earned it.
Interspersed with chapters chronicling Walter’s narrative are stories of Stevenson’s other clients and work. His closeness with these prisoners and their horrifying circumstances makes Stevenson more determined to help and causes him to reflect on abstract issues that nevertheless imbue the criminal justice system, like humanity and mercy. Stevenson focuses on several categories of vulnerable people who become trapped in the system, including mentally ill prisoners, disabled prisoners, and poor women who give birth to stillborn babies. 
Stevenson and his team at EJI also become increasingly focused on juvenile offenders who are sometimes tried as adults despite their young age. These offenders may be given de facto death sentences by being sentenced to life without parole and face perilous circumstances when they are housed in adult prisons. Stevenson illustrates how these prisoners retain their own humanity while being forced to live under inhumane conditions. He also discusses some of the qualities common among these types of prisoners: They are generally poor and disproportionately people of color, and most of them lack adequate legal counsel. The juveniles have horrific backgrounds of abuse and neglect.
Stevenson and his team at EJI also work to change the legal system to offer more protection to marginalized people. Several of his cases end up before the U.S. Supreme Court, and he succeeds in winning rulings that ban as unconstitutional the conviction of children to life without parole and the execution of people deemed incompetent from dementia or neurological disease. EJI works to raise public awareness of issues surrounding unfair incarceration, produces groundbreaking reports on racial issues, and sets up programs to help formerly incarcerated people adjust to life on the outside.
Stevenson also reflects on the issues that surround the criminal justice system. His time spent with prisoners awaiting their execution makes him realize how inhumane it is to prepare another human to die. After decades of work, when Stevenson fails to prevent the execution of a man who suffers from an intellectual disability, he momentarily feels unable to continue his work. However, he realizes that he cannot help but be broken by his experiences and comes to understand that it is his own brokenness that allows him to more fully understand the need for mercy and to bring compassion to others. The book ends with Stevenson’s renewed commitment to helping others."
Book,"Winston Smith is a low-ranking member of the ruling Party in London, in the nation of Oceania. Everywhere Winston goes, even his own home, the Party watches him through telescreens; everywhere he looks he sees the face of the Party’s seemingly omniscient leader, a figure known only as Big Brother. The Party controls everything in Oceania, even the people’s history and language. Currently, the Party is forcing the implementation of an invented language called Newspeak, which attempts to prevent political rebellion by eliminating all words related to it. Even thinking rebellious thoughts is illegal. Such thoughtcrime is, in fact, the worst of all crimes.
As the novel opens, Winston feels frustrated by the oppression and rigid control of the Party, which prohibits free thought, sex, and any expression of individuality. Winston dislikes the party and has illegally purchased a diary in which to write his criminal thoughts. He has also become fixated on a powerful Party member named O’Brien, whom Winston believes is a secret member of the Brotherhood—the mysterious, legendary group that works to overthrow the Party.
Winston works in the Ministry of Truth, where he alters historical records to fit the needs of the Party. He notices a coworker, a beautiful dark-haired girl, staring at him, and worries that she is an informant who will turn him in for his thoughtcrime. He is troubled by the Party’s control of history: the Party claims that Oceania has always been allied with Eastasia in a war against Eurasia, but Winston seems to recall a time when this was not true. The Party also claims that Emmanuel Goldstein, the alleged leader of the Brotherhood, is the most dangerous man alive, but this does not seem plausible to Winston. Winston spends his evenings wandering through the poorest neighborhoods in London, where the proletarians, or proles, live squalid lives, relatively free of Party monitoring.
One day, Winston receives a note from the dark-haired girl that reads “I love you.” She tells him her name, Julia, and they begin a covert affair, always on the lookout for signs of Party monitoring. Eventually they rent a room above the secondhand store in the prole district where Winston bought the diary. This relationship lasts for some time. Winston is sure that they will be caught and punished sooner or later (the fatalistic Winston knows that he has been doomed since he wrote his first diary entry), while Julia is more pragmatic and optimistic. As Winston’s affair with Julia progresses, his hatred for the Party grows more and more intense. At last, he receives the message that he has been waiting for: O’Brien wants to see him.
Winston and Julia travel to O’Brien’s luxurious apartment. As a member of the powerful Inner Party (Winston belongs to the Outer Party), O’Brien leads a life of luxury that Winston can only imagine. O’Brien confirms to Winston and Julia that, like them, he hates the Party, and says that he works against it as a member of the Brotherhood. He indoctrinates Winston and Julia into the Brotherhood, and gives Winston a copy of Emmanuel Goldstein’s book, the manifesto of the Brotherhood. Winston reads the book—an amalgam of several forms of class-based twentieth-century social theory—to Julia in the room above the store. Suddenly, soldiers barge in and seize them. Mr. Charrington, the proprietor of the store, is revealed as having been a member of the Thought Police all along.
Torn away from Julia and taken to a place called the Ministry of Love, Winston finds that O’Brien, too, is a Party spy who simply pretended to be a member of the Brotherhood in order to trap Winston into committing an open act of rebellion against the Party. O’Brien spends months torturing and brainwashing Winston, who struggles to resist. At last, O’Brien sends him to the dreaded Room 101, the final destination for anyone who opposes the Party. Here, O’Brien tells Winston that he will be forced to confront his worst fear. Throughout the novel, Winston has had recurring nightmares about rats; O’Brien now straps a cage full of rats onto Winston’s head and prepares to allow the rats to eat his face. Winston snaps, pleading with O’Brien to do it to Julia, not to him.
Giving up Julia is what O’Brien wanted from Winston all along. His spirit broken, Winston is released to the outside world. He meets Julia but no longer feels anything for her. He has accepted the Party entirely and has learned to love Big Brother."
Economic,"Walden opens with a simple announcement that Thoreau spent two years in Walden Pond, near Concord, Massachusetts, living a simple life supported by no one. He says that he now resides among the civilized again; the episode was clearly both experimental and temporary. The first chapter, “Economy,” is a manifesto of social thought and meditations on domestic management, and in it Thoreau sketches out his ideals as he describes his pond project. He devotes attention to the skepticism and wonderment with which townspeople had greeted news of his project, and he defends himself from their views that society is the only place to live. He recounts the circumstances of his move to Walden Pond, along with a detailed account of the steps he took to construct his rustic habitation and the methods by which he supported himself in the course of his wilderness experiment. It is a chapter full of facts, figures, and practical advice, but also offers big ideas about the claims of individualism versus social existence, all interspersed with evidence of scholarship and a propensity for humor.
Thoreau tells us that he completed his cabin in the spring of 1845 and moved in on July 4 of that year. Most of the materials and tools he used to build his home he borrowed or scrounged from previous sites. The land he squats on belongs to his friend Ralph Waldo Emerson; he details a cost-analysis of the entire construction project. In order to make a little money, Thoreau cultivates a modest bean-field, a job that tends to occupy his mornings. He reserves his afternoons and evenings for contemplation, reading, and walking about the countryside. Endorsing the values of austerity, simplicity, and solitude, Thoreau consistently emphasizes the minimalism of his lifestyle and the contentment to be derived from it. He repeatedly contrasts his own freedom with the imprisonment of others who devote their lives to material prosperity.
Despite his isolation, Thoreau feels the presence of society surrounding him. The Fitchburg Railroad rushes past Walden Pond, interrupting his reveries and forcing him to contemplate the power of technology. Thoreau also finds occasion to converse with a wide range of other people, such as the occasional peasant farmer, railroad worker, or the odd visitor to Walden. He describes in some detail his association with a Canadian-born woodcutter, Alex Therien, who is grand and sincere in his character, though modest in intellectual attainments. Thoreau makes frequent trips into Concord to seek the society of his longtime friends and to conduct what scattered business the season demands. On one such trip, Thoreau spends a night in jail for refusing to pay a poll tax because, he says, the government supports slavery. Released the next day, Thoreau returns to Walden.
Thoreau devotes great attention to nature, the passing of the seasons, and the creatures with which he shares the woods. He recounts the habits of a panoply of animals, from woodchucks to partridges. Some he endows with a larger meaning, often spiritual or psychological. The hooting loon that plays hide and seek with Thoreau, for instance, becomes a symbol of the playfulness of nature and its divine laughter at human endeavors. Another example of animal symbolism is the full-fledged ant war that Thoreau stumbles upon, prompting him to meditate on human warfare. Thoreau’s interest in animals is not exactly like the naturalist’s or zoologist’s. He does not observe and describe them neutrally and scientifically, but gives them a moral and philosophical significance, as if each has a distinctive lesson to teach him.
As autumn turns to winter, Thoreau begins preparations for the arrival of the cold. He listens to the squirrel, the rabbit, and the fox as they scuttle about gathering food. He watches the migrating birds, and welcomes the pests that infest his cabin as they escape the coming frosts. He prepares his walls with plaster to shut out the wind. By day he makes a study of the snow and ice, giving special attention to the mystic blue ice of Walden Pond, and by night he sits and listens to the wind as it whips and whistles outside his door. Thoreau occasionally sees ice-fishermen come to cut out huge blocks that are shipped off to cities, and contemplates how most of the ice will melt and flow back to Walden Pond. Occasionally Thoreau receives a visit from a friend like William Ellery Channing or Amos Bronson Alcott, but for the most part he is alone. In one chapter, he conjures up visions of earlier residents of Walden Pond long dead and largely forgotten, including poor tradesmen and former slaves. Thoreau prefers to see himself in their company, rather than amid the cultivated and wealthy classes.
As he becomes acquainted with Walden Pond and neighboring ponds, Thoreau wants to map their layout and measure their depths. Thoreau finds that Walden Pond is no more than a hundred feet deep, thereby refuting common folk wisdom that it is bottomless. He meditates on the pond as a symbol of infinity that people need in their lives. Eventually winter gives way to spring, and with a huge crash and roar the ice of Walden Pond begins to melt and hit the shore. In lyric imagery echoing the onset of Judgment Day, Thoreau describes the coming of spring as a vast transformation of the face of the world, a time when all sins are forgiven.
Thoreau announces that his project at the pond is over, and that he returned to civilized life on September 6, 1847. The revitalization of the landscape suggests the restoration of the full powers of the human soul, and Thoreau’s narrative observations give way, in the last chapter of Walden, to a more direct sermonizing about the untapped potential within humanity. In visionary language, Thoreau exhorts us to “meet” our lives and live fully."
Applying,"A Raisin in the Sun portrays a few weeks in the life of the Youngers, a Black family living on the South Side of Chicago in the 1950s. When the play opens, the Youngers are about to receive an insurance check for $10,000. This money comes from the deceased Mr. Younger’s life insurance policy. Each of the adult members of the family has an idea as to what he or she would like to do with this money. The matriarch of the family, Mama, wants to buy a house to fulfill a dream she shared with her husband. Mama’s son, Walter Lee, would rather use the money to invest in a liquor store with his friends. He believes that the investment will solve the family’s financial problems forever. Walter’s wife, Ruth, agrees with Mama, however, and hopes that she and Walter can provide more space and opportunity for their son, Travis. Finally, Beneatha, Walter’s sister and Mama’s daughter, wants to use the money for her medical school tuition. She also wishes that her family members were not so interested in assimilating into the white world. Beneatha instead tries to find her identity by looking back to the past and to Africa.
As the play progresses, the Youngers clash over their competing dreams. Ruth discovers that she is pregnant but fears that if she has the child, she will put more financial pressure on her family members. When Walter says nothing to Ruth’s admission that she is considering abortion, Mama puts a down payment on a house for the whole family. She believes that a bigger, brighter dwelling will help them all. This house is in Clybourne Park, an entirely white neighborhood. When the Youngers’ future neighbors find out that the Youngers are moving in, they send Mr. Lindner, from the Clybourne Park Improvement Association, to offer the Youngers money in return for staying away. The Youngers refuse the deal, even after Walter loses the rest of the money ($6,500) to his friend Willy Harris, who persuades Walter to invest in the liquor store and then runs off with his cash.
In the meantime, Beneatha rejects her suitor, George Murchison, whom she believes to be shallow and blind to the problems of race. Subsequently, she receives a marriage proposal from her Nigerian boyfriend, Joseph Asagai, who wants Beneatha to get a medical degree and move to Africa with him (Beneatha does not make her choice before the end of the play). The Youngers eventually move out of the apartment, fulfilling the family’s long-held dream. Their future seems uncertain and slightly dangerous, but they are optimistic and determined to live a better life. They believe that they can succeed if they stick together as a family and resolve to defer their dreams no longer."

Cleaner,"In 1998, Barbara Ehrenreich, a journalist and activist then in her late 50s, sets out to document the daily struggles of America’s working poor. Having trained as a biologist, she decides to do fieldwork: in three different U.S. cities, she takes minimum-wage jobs and looks for affordable places to live. She leaves her Ph.D. and most of her skills off of her applications, to ensure that she is given the lowest-level positions available to a white, native-English speaking woman. However, she will use outside cash, if necessary, to ensure that she will never be without a car, she will not have to skip meals to save money, and she will never be homeless.
Ehrenreich’s first experiences are in Key West, Florida. Her most affordable living option, cheaper than a trailer in town, is a shabby efficiency apartment thirty miles away. Although she expects to earn $7 per hour, the first job she lands, as a diner waitress, pays much less, because she will also earn tips. The job requires not only serving tables but also additional work, like cleaning and restocking. Although Ehrenreich gets along well with her coworkers, she struggles as a waitress, because of her lack of experience. Realizing that she will not be able to stay in her apartment on what she is earning, she tries takes a second waitressing job, at another diner. She quickly realizes she will be physically unable to work both jobs, quits the first job, and takes a hotel housekeeping job next door to the second diner, instead. However, when her supervisor at the second diner yells at her, Ehrenreich has had enough and walks out.
Ehrenreich’s next location is Portland, Maine. There, after much searching, she finds a small apartment she will be able to afford. She takes two jobs. The first is with a maid service that cleans the homes of affluent clients where she works on a cleaning team with several other women. The work is back-breaking, and Ehrenreich develops a skin rash of unknown origin. She sees the other women continue to work even when they are injured or feeling sick. She notices that the cleaning techniques the team is taught to use are more about making homes look cleaner than about actually cleaning them. She learns that her employer charges customers $25 per person-hour, while she will earn $6.65 an hour. Ehrenreich’s other job is at a nursing home, where she helps serve food to residents with Alzheimer’s. The interactions with the residents are pleasant, but the cleanup work after meals is overwhelming, partly because one of the automatic dishwashers is broken.
In Minneapolis, Minnesota, finally, Ehrenreich has a very hard time finding safe, sanitary housing she can afford. A charity worker suggests that she check into a shelter while saving up first month’s rent. She has two job applications accepted, but backs out of one job, at a hardware store, when her very first shift is scheduled to last eleven hours without overtime pay. The other job is in women’s clothing at Wal-Mart. The day-long orientation for new employees includes criticism of labor unions, while the pay is less than typical for the area. The store layout is constantly changing, and customers make extra work for her by leaving unbought merchandise in other departments. The job makes Ehrenreich, by her own account, callous and spiteful. Meanwhile, she has been unable to secure a long-term rental situation. Fed up, at one of the employee meetings she starts talking about the need for a union. By now, she has already decided to quit.
Reviewing her experiences in light of the data from many different studies, Ehrenreich comes to several conclusions. She finds that workers cannot support themselves on minimum wage in America unless they work multiple jobs, and only so long as there are no unexpected expenses, such as for medical care. Ehrenreich also finds that employers try to keep information about the wages they pay from becoming general knowledge among workers. Additionally, she finds that the ways in which workers are supervised, including random urine tests for drug use, encourage the workers to accept being dehumanized. Ehrenreich adds that the attitudes found in managers of low-wage employees are based on class or racial prejudice. Finally, she states that medical benefits and child care are too expensive even for middle-class workers, let alone ones on minimum wage. She notes that perhaps someday the working poor will refuse to stop accepting their situation and will demand that things change—and concludes that the country will be a better place when they do."
Watching,"Janie Crawford, an attractive, confident, middle-aged Black woman, returns to Eatonville, Florida, after a long absence. The Black townspeople gossip about her and speculate about where she has been and what has happened to her young husband, Tea Cake. They take her confidence as aloofness, but Janie’s friend Pheoby Watson sticks up for her. Pheoby visits her to find out what has happened. Their conversation frames the story that Janie relates.
Janie explains that her grandmother raised her after her mother ran off. Nanny loves her granddaughter and is dedicated to her, but her life as a slave and experience with her own daughter, Janie’s mother, has warped her worldview. Her primary desire is to marry Janie as soon as possible to a husband who can provide security and social status for her. She finds a much older farmer named Logan Killicks and insists that Janie marry him.
After moving in with Logan, Janie is miserable. Logan is pragmatic and unromantic and, in general, treats her like a pack mule. One day, Joe Starks, a smooth-tongued and ambitious man, ambles down the road in front of the farm. He and Janie flirt in secret for a couple weeks before she runs off and marries him.
Janie and Jody, as she calls him, travel to all-Black Eatonville, where Jody hopes to have a “big voice.” A consummate politician, Jody soon succeeds in becoming the mayor, postmaster, storekeeper, and the biggest landlord in town. But Janie seeks something more than a man with a big voice. She soon becomes disenchanted with the monotonous, stifling life that she shares with Jody. She wishes that she could be a part of the rich social life in town, but Jody doesn’t allow her to interact with “common” people. Jody sees Janie as the fitting ornament to his wealth and power, and he tries to shape her into his vision of what a mayor’s wife should be. On the surface, Janie silently submits to Jody; inside, however, she remains passionate and full of dreams.
After almost two decades of marriage, Janie finally asserts herself. When Jody insults her appearance, Janie rips him to shreds in front of the townspeople, telling them all how ugly and impotent he is. In retaliation, he savagely beats her. Their marriage breaks down, and Jody becomes quite ill. After months without interacting, Janie visits him on his deathbed. Refusing to be silenced, she once again chastises him for the way that he treated her. As she berates him, he dies.
After Jody’s funeral, Janie feels free for the first time in years. She rebuffs various suitors who come to court her because she loves her newfound independence. But when Tea Cake, a man twelve years her junior, enters her life, Janie immediately senses a spark of mutual attraction. She begins dating Tea Cake despite critical gossip within the town. To everyone’s shock, Janie then marries Tea Cake nine months after Jody’s death, sells Jody’s store, and leaves town to go with Tea Cake to Jacksonville.
During the first week of their marriage, Tea Cake and Janie encounter difficulties. He steals her money and leaves her alone one night, making her think that he married her only for her money. But he returns, explaining that he never meant to leave her and that his theft occurred in a moment of weakness. Afterward, they promise to share all their experiences and opinions with each other. They move to the Everglades, where they work during the harvest season and socialize during the summer off-season. Tea Cake’s quick wit and friendliness make their shack the center of entertainment and social life.
A terrible hurricane bursts into the Everglades two years after Janie and Tea Cake’s marriage. As they desperately flee the rising waters, a rabid dog bites Tea Cake. At the time, Tea Cake doesn’t realize the dog’s condition; three weeks later, however, he falls ill. During a rabies--induced bout of madness, Tea Cake becomes convinced that Janie is cheating on him. He starts firing a pistol at her and Janie is forced to kill him to save her life. She is immediately put on trial for murder, but the all-white, all-male jury finds her not guilty. She returns to Eatonville where her former neighbors are ready to spin malicious gossip about her circumstances, assuming that Tea Cake has left her and taken her money. Janie wraps up her recounting to Pheoby, who is greatly impressed by Janie’s experiences. Back in her room that night, Janie feels at one with Tea Cake and at peace with herself."
Here,"There There is a collection of stories about different people who are all traveling to the Big Oakland Powwow in California. Each chapter follows a different character, describing their history and explaining why they are going to the powwow. Each of the characters is Native American, but not all of them embrace their heritage.
Tony Loneman, twenty-one years old, was born with fetal alcohol syndrome. While he grew up believing he was not intelligent, he has natural street smarts. When he looks in the mirror, Tony sees what he calls “the Drome”: the facial features associated with fetal alcohol syndrome. Tony lives with his grandmother and has been selling drugs since he was thirteen. His drug supplier, Octavio, shows him a 3-D printed gun and tells him that they are going to rob the Big Oakland Powwow at the Oakland Coliseum.
Dene Oxendene lives in Oakland and is a young, motivated artist. He obtains a grant to make a storytelling documentary in which Native people share their perspectives on living in Oakland. He inherited both his camera and his interest in moviemaking from his late uncle. Dene plans to set up a storytelling booth at the powwow.
Opal Viola Victoria Bear Shield and her sister, Jacquie Red Feather, were children when their mother took them to Alcatraz Island in 1970 as part of Native American protests. Opal mostly spent time with her mother there, while Jacquie spent time with a group of teenagers. Before leaving the island, Jacquie was raped by another teen named Harvey. She became pregnant and put the baby girl up for adoption. When Opal and Jacquie’s mother died, they entered the foster care system. Jacquie had another daughter, Jamie, who went on to have three boys: Orvil, Loother, and Lony. Jamie was a heroin addict and eventually killed herself. Since Jacquie was still battling alcohol addiction, Opal adopted Jacquie’s three grandsons. While raising the boys, Opal has taught them that they are not to engage in any Native activities. 
Orvil Red Feather, the oldest of Jacquie’s grandsons, watches footage of powwows on the internet. Feeling a connection to the dancers, he finds a set of Native regalia in Opal’s closet and practices dancing. He takes his brothers to the Big Oakland Powwow without telling Opal, hoping that he can win prize money by dancing. Opal goes to the powwow to watch, careful not to let the boys know that she is attending.
Jacquie Red Feather lives in New Mexico, where she works as an addiction counselor but still struggles with alcoholism herself. She has never actually met her grandsons. When she runs into Harvey at an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, she confronts him about their past. Harvey has just learned that he has a son in Oakland named Edwin, and Jacquie tells him that they have a daughter, the one she put up for adoption. Jacquie agrees to ride with Harvey to Oakland, even though she has a difficult time forgiving him.
Harvey’s son, Edwin Black, still lives with his mother, even though he is in his thirties. His mother helps him get a paid internship at the Indian Center where he helps organize the Big Oakland Powwow. Her boyfriend, Bill Davis, works as part of the maintenance crew for the Oakland Coliseum, where the powwow will be held.
Blue is Jacquie’s first daughter, who was put up for adoption. She was raised in Oakland but later moved to Oklahoma. Stuck in an abusive marriage, Blue escaped Oklahoma and moved back to Oakland. She has been working at the Indian Center in Oakland for a year. She and Edwin plan the Big Oakland Powwow.
Calvin Johnson lives with his sister in Oakland. He and his brother Charles work for Octavio, Tony’s supplier, selling drugs. Calvin owes Octavio money and has been avoiding him. Charles and his crime partner, Carlos, take Calvin to Octavio to sort out the issue. Octavio tells the group that they are going to rob the Big Oakland Powwow with 3-D printed guns that can get through the security checkpoint. Because Calvin works at the Indian Center, he is afraid that he will be recognized.
Thomas Frank goes to the powwow to drum and sing for the dancers. He has recently been fired from the Indian Center, but drumming gives him a sense of belonging.
On the day of the powwow, Blue and Edwin arrive early to set up the field. Dene Oxendene sets up his storytelling booth, hoping to film interviews with people and ask what the powwow experience means to them. Harvey is the powwow emcee, and Jacquie sits with him in the tent with all of the sound equipment. Edwin and Blue walk over and meet Harvey and Jacquie. Harvey embraces Edwin, recognizing that he is his son. Blue thinks that Jacquie might be her mother and is in shock (she does not realize that Harvey is her father). Jacquie sees Orvil’s name on the list of men who will be dancing.
Orvil and his brothers, Loother and Lony, ride their bikes to the powwow. Orvil puts on the regalia that he took from Opal’s closet and dances out during the Grand Entry. Up in the stands, Opal watches his performance.
Entering the Coliseum with their 3-D printed guns, Calvin, Octavio, Charles, Carlos, and Tony approach the table where Edwin and Blue are sitting. Tony is supposed to do the actual holdup while the others keep watch, but he changes his mind. In his place, Octavio approaches the table and points his gun at Edwin and Blue, demanding the money. After Octavio has the money (in the form of Visa gift cards), Charles and Carlos try to rob him. Octavio shoots at Charles but then is killed by Carlos. Calvin dies in the crossfire. Tony, seeing that many innocent people are also caught in the crossfire, shoots Carlos and then tackles Charles. Tony kills Charles but is hit many times and also dies. 
Thomas, Orvil, and Edwin are among the people caught in the crossfire. Thomas dies. Blue takes Edwin to the hospital while Opal, Harvey, and Jacquie take Orvil to the hospital.  Both boys are admitted at the emergency room, but their fate is unclear."
Succumb,"Frederick Douglass was born into slavery sometime in 1817 or 1818. Like many enslaved people, he is unsure of his exact date of birth. Douglass is separated from his mother, Harriet Bailey, soon after he is born. His father is most likely their white master, Captain Anthony. Captain Anthony is the clerk of a rich man named Colonel Lloyd. Lloyd enslaves hundreds of men, women, and children, who call his large, central plantation the “Great House Farm.” Life on any of Lloyd’s plantations, like that on many Southern plantations, is brutal. Those enslaved are overworked and exhausted, receive little food, few articles of clothing, and no beds. Those who break rules—and even those who do not—are beaten or whipped, and sometimes even shot by the plantation overseers, the cruelest of which are Mr. Severe and Mr. Austin Gore. 
Douglass’s life on this plantation is not as hard as that of most of the others. Being a child, he serves in the household instead of in the fields. At the age of seven, he is given to Captain Anthony’s son‑in‑law’s brother, Hugh Auld, who lives in Baltimore. In Baltimore, Douglass enjoys a relatively freer life. In general, city slave-owners are more conscious of appearing cruel or neglectful toward those they enslave in front of their non‑slaveowning neighbors.
Sophia Auld, Hugh’s wife, has never ""owned"" enslaved people before, and therefore she is surprisingly kind to Douglass at first. She even begins to teach Douglass to read, until her husband orders her to stop, saying that education makes enslaved people unmanageable. Eventually, Sophia succumbs to the mentality of slaveowning and loses her natural kindliness. Though Sophia and Hugh Auld become crueler toward him, Douglass still likes Baltimore and is able to teach himself to read with the help of local boys. As he learns to read and write, Douglass becomes conscious of the evils of slavery and of the existence of the abolitionist, or antislavery, movement. He resolves to escape to the North eventually.
After the deaths of Captain Anthony and his remaining heirs, Douglass is taken back to serve Thomas Auld, Captain Anthony’s son‑in‑law. Auld is a mean man made harsher by his false religious piety. Auld considers Douglass unmanageable, so Auld rents him for one year to Edward Covey, a man known for “breaking” enslaved people. Covey manages, in the first six months, to work and whip all the spirit out of Douglass. Douglass becomes a brutish man, no longer interested in reading or freedom, capable only of resting from his injuries and exhaustion. The turning point comes when Douglass resolves to fight back against Covey. The two men have a two‑hour fight, after which Covey never touches Douglass again.
His year with Covey over, Douglass is next rented to William Freeland for two years. Though Freeland is a milder, fairer man, Douglass’s will to escape is nonetheless renewed. At Freeland’s, Douglass begins educating his fellow enslaved people in a Sabbath school at the homes of free Black people. Despite the threat of punishment and violence they face, many enslaved people from neighboring farms come to Douglass and work diligently to learn. At Freeland’s, Douglass also forms a plan of escape with three fellow enslaved men with whom he is close. Someone betrays their plan to Freeland, however, and Douglass and the others are taken to jail. Thomas Auld then sends Douglass back to Baltimore with Hugh Auld, to learn the trade of ship caulking.
In Baltimore’s trade industry, Douglass runs up against strained race relations. White workers have been working alongside free Black workers, but the whites have begun to fear that the increasing numbers of free Black people will take their jobs. Though only an apprentice and still enslaved, Douglass encounters violent tactics of intimidation from his white coworkers and is forced to switch shipyards. In his new apprenticeship, Douglass quickly learns the trade of caulking and soon earns the highest wages possible, always turning them over to Hugh Auld.
Eventually, Douglass receives permission from Hugh Auld to hire out his extra time. He saves money bit by bit and eventually makes his escape to New York. Douglass refrains from describing the details of his escape in order to protect the safety of future slaves who may attempt the journey. In New York, Douglass fears recapture and changes his name from Bailey to Douglass. Soon after, he marries Anna Murray, a free woman he met while in Baltimore. They move north to Massachusetts, where Douglass becomes deeply engaged with the abolitionist movement as both a writer and an orator."
Lost,"The four Garcia sisters, Carla, Sandra, Yolanda and Sofia, enjoyed a fairly sheltered and luxurious childhood in the Dominican Republic. They often received exciting presents from FAO Schwarz in the United States. Carla remembers an iron bank representing Mary ascending to heaven, which she gave to one of the family's maids, who was later dismissed for stealing the bank. Yolanda played with her boy cousin and showed him her genitals in exchange for a Human Body doll and modeling clay. She also stole a newborn kitten from its mother and put it inside a drum that she played until she grew bored and threw the kitten outside, where it sadly hobbled away. The mother cat appeared to her in nightmares and haunted her. Sandra wanted to be an artist but her irrepressible spirit got her in trouble and she was thrown out of art class. She later came upon a naked chained insane sculptor who scared her as she fell and broke her arm. She lost her artistic vision and settled for being the sculptor's muse when she realized he had used her face in a representation of the Virgin Mary.
When their father, Carlos, got in trouble with the secret police for agitating against the military dictatorship, the family enlisted the help of a CIA operative, Vic, to get them out of the country. They fled to New York City, where they had trouble adjusting culturally and materially to the new situation. Laura, the sisters' mother, came from a wealthy and influential family in the Dominican Republic and did not like having to become a middle class nobody in the United States. She found comfort through supporting her daughters' endeavors, such as Yolanda's poetry and Sofia's defiance of her father's overprotective nature.
Dr. Fanning helped Carlos get a medical fellowship, and offered to take the family out for a celebratory dinner once they had settled in the United States. Laura wanted to make a good impression and pressured the girls to behave themselves and not ask for any special treats. After Sandra saw Mrs. Fanning kiss her father in the restroom, she insisted that Dr. Fanning buy her a flamenco doll. Carla had trouble fitting in to American school settings, and was harassed by abusive and prejudiced schoolboys. She also was nearly molested by a perverted exhibitionist in a car. Yolanda began to write in English and found a way to express her own voice, though she started off by imitating Walt Whitman. Her father criticized her insubordination, which Yolanda perceived to be intellectual independence. Sofia was sent to the Dominican Republic as a punishment for using marijuana, though she ended up getting into more trouble by spending time without a chaperone with her illegitimate cousin, Manuel.
In college, Yolanda had trouble relating to men, since she was turned off by the vocabulary men use to describe sex. Though she was attracted to a boy, Rudy, she would not sleep with him and he accused her of being frigid. She was hurt by this but later realized that he was just a jerk. She later married a man she thought she loved, John, though at a certain point they had problems communicating. Like Rudy, he did not understand her Dominican cultural heritage, and could not appreciate the Spanish language. When Yolanda stopped trusting and loving John, she could not understand the words he used, and only heard ""babble, babble."" She had a mental breakdown at her parents' house, in which she could only quote and misquote bits of things she had read and heard throughout her life. She spent time in a mental hospital until she recovered. Her sister Sandra also had a mental breakdown, in which she thought she was regressing through evolution, and would eventually cease to be human.
After Sandra is released from the hospital, Sofia planned to reconcile with her father during a birthday party. She broke tradition, in that the daughters would usually come home for their father's birthday, but she hosts the party at her house to show off her German husband and two blond children. She and her father had fought when he accused her of sleeping around during a trip to Colombia, where she met her husband, Otto. She ran away from home to assert her independence, and later married Otto. Though the party was going well, Sofia was hurt that her father did not express more affection toward her. She humiliated him with a seductive kiss in the ear as part of a party game. Yolanda returned to the Dominican Republic, possibly for good, to embrace her extended family and cultural roots. Her family thought she was crazy for driving into the countryside by herself, but she ignored them. She got lost looking for fresh guavas, and then got a flat tire. When approached by two men, she panicked and pretended not to speak any Spanish. Yolanda felt more comfortable in her English speaking American identity than with the Dominican side of her personality."
View,"Lucy Honeychurch, a young upper middle class woman, visits Italy under the charge of her older cousin Charlotte. At their pension, or guesthouse, in Florence, they are given rooms that look into the courtyard rather than out over the river Arno. Mr. Emerson, a fellow guest, generously offers them the rooms belonging to himself and his son George. Although Charlotte is offended by Mr. Emerson's lack of tact and propriety, she finally does agree to the switch. Lucy is an avid young pianist. Mr. Beebe, watches her passionate playing and predicts that someday she will live her life with as much gusto as she plays the piano.
Lucy's visit to Italy is marked by several significant encounters with the Emersons. In Santa Croce church, George complains that his father means well, but always offends everyone. Mr. Emerson tells Lucy that his son needs her in order to overcome his youthful melancholy. Later, Lucy is walking in the Piazza Signoria, feeling dull, when she comes in close contact with two quarreling Italian men. One man stabs the other, and she faints, to be rescued by George. On their return trip home, he kisses her, much to her surprise. She keeps his rash behavior a secret.
On a country outing in the hills, Lucy wanders in search of Mr. Beebe and the supercilious chaplain, Mr. Eager. However, the Italian cab driver leads her instead to George, who is standing on a terrace covered with blue violets. George sees her and again kisses her, but this time Charlotte sees him and chastises him after they have resurnedreturned to the pension. She leaves with Lucy for Rome the next day.
The second half of the book centers on Lucy's home in Surrey, where she lives with her mother, Mrs. Honeychurch, and her brother, Freddy. A man she met in Rome, the snobbish Cecil Vyse, proposes marriage to her for the third time, and she accepts him. He disapproves of her family and the country people she knows, finding them coarse and unsophisticated. There is a small, ugly villa available for rent in the town, and as a joke, Cecil offers it to the Emersons, whom he meets by chance in a museum. They take him up on the offer and move in, much to Lucy's initial horror.
George plays tennis with the Honeychurches on a Sunday when Cecil is at his most intolerable. After the game, Cecil reads from a book by Miss Lavish, a woman who also stayed with Lucy and Charlotte at the pension in Florence. The novel records a kiss among violets, and Lucy realizes that Charlotte let the secret out. In a moment alone, George kisses her again. Lucy tells him to leave, but George insists that Cecil is not the right man for her, characterizing Cecil as controlling and appreciative of things rather than people. Lucy sees Cecil in a new light, and breaks off her engagement that night.
However, Lucy will not believe that she loves George; she wants to stay unmarried and travel to Greece with some elderly women she met in Italy, the Miss Alans. She meets old Mr. Emerson by chance, who insists that she loves George and should marry him, because it is what her soul truly wants. Lucy realizes he is right, and though she must fly against convention, she marries George, and the book ends with the happy couple staying together in the Florence pension again, in a room with a view.
Analysis
The book depicts Lucy's struggles as she emerges as her own woman, growing from indecision to fulfillment. She struggles between strict, old-fashioned Victorian values and newer, more liberal mores. In this struggle Lucy's own idea of what is true evolves and matures. Her trip to Italy opens her sheltered eyes to ideas and people unlike those she has known growing up in the English countryside. She also notices how freely Italian classes seem to mix, and realizes that the social boundaries she has always regarded as fixed are actually arbitrary. Her experience with the Emersons shows her that there can be beauty in the things that are considered improper, and Charlotte's betrayal shows her that propriety is not always the best judge of what is true.
Having more clearly found herself in Italy, Lucy's real test lies at home, where she must confront her old familiar surroundings. She is still uncertain, however, and confused about what to think about her new experiences. That she missteps and becomes engaged to the pretentious and domineering Cecil shows her susceptibility to the pressures of society. As her bold piano playing suggests, she is cut out for a more daring life, if only she could cut herself away from the restricting social boundaries that engulf her. The Emersons, as free-thinking, modern, truth-loving people, are her deliverers from the grips of society. It is this freedom that allows her to see beyond the dictates of propriety that forbid her marriage to the lower-class George and, therefore, to follow her heart.
George is troubled by existential worries in Italy. He doesn't understand how life can be truly joyful and worthwhile when it is always shadowed by enigma, symbolized by the question mark that he hangs on the wall of his hotel. Lucy, though cautious, is loving by nature and enjoys life even when it challenges her understanding. The two are united by a shared appreciation for beauty, which might be captured in their love of views: Lucy adores the view of the Arno through the pension window, while George's first memory is of himself and his parents gazing at a view. Each possesses what the other needs: George finds simple joys staying with the Honeychurch family, while Lucy finds the courage to recognize her own individuality through her contact with the Emersons.

A Room with a View is one of Forster's early works, and is not as complex as the more mature Howard's End and Passage to India. However, its strength lies in its vivid cast of characters, humorous dialogue, and comedic play upon the manners of the day, and in Forster's engaging, sympathetic exploration of Lucy's character."
Morbid,"Guy Montag is a fireman who burns books in a futuristic American city. In Montag’s world, firemen start fires rather than putting them out. The people in this society do not read books, enjoy nature, spend time by themselves, think independently, or have meaningful conversations. Instead, they drive very fast, watch excessive amounts of television on wall-size sets, and listen to the radio on “Seashell Radio” sets attached to their ears.
Montag encounters a gentle seventeen-year-old girl named Clarisse McClellan, who opens his eyes to the emptiness of his life with her innocently penetrating questions and her unusual love of people and nature. Over the next few days, Montag experiences a series of disturbing events. First, his wife, Mildred, attempts suicide by swallowing a bottle of sleeping pills. Then, when he responds to an alarm that an old woman has a stash of hidden literature, the woman shocks him by choosing to be burned alive along with her books. A few days later, he hears that Clarisse has been killed by a speeding car. Montag’s dissatisfaction with his life increases, and he begins to search for a solution in a stash of books that he has stolen from his own fires and hidden inside an air-conditioning vent.
When Montag fails to show up for work, his fire chief, Beatty, pays a visit to his house. Beatty explains that it’s normal for a fireman to go through a phase of wondering what books have to offer, and he delivers a dizzying monologue explaining how books came to be banned in the first place. According to Beatty, special-interest groups and other “minorities” objected to books that offended them. Soon, books all began to look the same, as writers tried to avoid offending anybody. This was not enough, however, and society as a whole decided to simply burn books rather than permit conflicting opinions. Beatty tells Montag to take twenty-four hours or so to see if his stolen books contain anything worthwhile and then turn them in for incineration. Montag begins a long and frenzied night of reading.
Overwhelmed by the task of reading, Montag looks to his wife for help and support, but she prefers television to her husband’s company and cannot understand why he would want to take the terrible risk of reading books. He remembers that he once met a retired English professor named Faber sitting in a park, and he decides that this man might be able to help him understand what he reads. He visits Faber, who tells him that the value of books lies in the detailed awareness of life that they contain. Faber says that Montag needs not only books but also the leisure to read them and the freedom to act upon their ideas.
Faber agrees to help Montag with his reading, and they concoct a risky scheme to overthrow the status quo. Faber will contact a printer and begin reproducing books, and Montag will plant books in the homes of firemen to discredit the profession and to destroy the machinery of censorship. Faber gives him a two-way radio earpiece (the “green bullet”) so that he can hear what Montag hears and talk to him secretly.
Montag goes home, and soon two of his wife’s friends arrive to watch television. The women discuss their families and the war that is about to be declared in an extremely frivolous manner. Their superficiality angers him, and he takes out a book of poetry and reads “Dover Beach” by Matthew Arnold. Faber buzzes in his ear for him to be quiet, and Mildred tries to explain that the poetry reading is a standard way for firemen to demonstrate the uselessness of literature. The women are extremely disturbed by the poem and leave to file a complaint against Montag.
Montag goes to the fire station and hands over one of his books to Beatty. Beatty confuses Montag by barraging him with contradictory quotations from great books. Beatty exploits these contradictions to show that literature is morbid and dangerously complex, and that it deserves incineration. Suddenly, the alarm sounds, and they rush off to answer the call, only to find that the alarm is at Montag’s own house. Mildred gets into a cab with her suitcase, and Montag realizes that his own wife has betrayed him.
Beatty forces Montag to burn the house himself; when he is done, Beatty places him under arrest. When Beatty continues to berate Montag, Montag turns the flamethrower on his superior and proceeds to burn him to ashes. Montag knocks the other firemen unconscious and runs. The Mechanical Hound, a monstrous machine that Beatty has set to attack Montag, pounces and injects Montag’s leg with a large dose of anesthetic. Montag manages to destroy it with his flamethrower; then he walks off the numbness in his leg and escapes with some books that were hidden in his backyard. He hides these in another fireman’s house and calls in an alarm from a pay phone.
Montag goes to Faber’s house, where he learns that a new Hound has been put on his trail, along with several helicopters and a television crew. Faber tells Montag that he is leaving for St. Louis to see a retired printer who may be able to help them. Montag gives Faber some money and tells him how to remove Montag’s scent from his house so the Hound will not enter it. Montag then takes some of Faber’s old clothes and runs off toward the river. The whole city watches as the chase unfolds on TV, but Montag manages to escape in the river and change into Faber’s clothes to disguise his scent. He drifts downstream into the country and follows a set of abandoned railroad tracks until he finds a group of renegade intellectuals (“the Book People”), led by a man named Granger, who welcome him. They are a part of a nationwide network of book lovers who have memorized many great works of literature and philosophy. They hope that they may be of some help to mankind in the aftermath of the war that has just been declared. Montag’s role is to memorize the Book of Ecclesiastes. Enemy jets appear in the sky and completely obliterate the city with bombs. Montag and his new friends move on to search for survivors and rebuild civilization."
Push,"Starr Carter, a sixteen-year-old black girl, attends a party in her neighborhood, Garden Heights. Starr goes with Kenya, a friend with whom she shares an older half-brother, Seven. Ever since attending Williamson Prep, a primarily white school, Starr feels out of place in the Garden Heights social scene. When Kenya goes off with other friends, Starr runs into her childhood best friend, Khalil Harris, whom she hasn’t seen in a long time. Gunshots from a gang fight interrupt the party, and Khalil offers to take Starr home. While Khalil drives, he explains rapper Tupac Shakur’s idea that “Thug Life” stands for “The Hate U Give Little Infants F---- Everybody.” Soon after, a white police officer with the badge number one-fifteen pulls them over. Khalil questions the motivation for the stop, and One-Fifteen orders him out of the car and searches him. One-Fifteen commands Khalil not to move, and returns to his car. Khalil opens the door to check on Starr. One-Fifteen fatally shoots Khalil.
Starr has nightmares about the death of another childhood friend, Natasha, who died in the crossfire of a gang shooting. At school on Monday, Starr feels tense around Hailey and Chris, her white friend and boyfriend, as memories of Khalil’s death interrupt her thoughts and she realizes they don’t understand. At the urging of her uncle Carlos, a police officer, Starr goes into the police station after school with her mother, Lisa, to testify about Khalil’s shooting. Starr realizes that the officers are asking more questions about whether Khalil was a troublemaker than about the night of the shooting. She worries that justice for Khalil will not be served. At Khalil’s funeral, a lawyer and activist named April Ofrah confirms Starr’s fears when she announces that the police will not pursue legal action against One-Fifteen and invites the attendees to a rally in Khalil’s honor. Starr blames herself for the police’s inaction. King, the head of a local gang called the King Lords, also interrupts the funeral and places a gray bandana on Khalil’s casket, signifying Khalil’s membership in the King Lords. April Ofrah tells Starr to call her if she needs legal representation.
The news that the police won’t prosecute One-Fifteen leads to days of protests in Garden Heights. During this time, Maverick, Starr’s father, explains to her his interpretation of Tupac’s phrase “Thug Life.” He believes that Thug Life describes a system designed against black communities. Only by speaking out can black communities begin to break the cycle. At the Carter family’s grocery store, a teenage member of the King Lords named DeVante begs Maverick, a former King Lord, to help him leave the gang. Maverick agrees. Starr sees DeVante’s request as a chance to help someone in a similar situation as Khalil. A few days later, Maverick gets into an argument with the neighborhood barber, Mr. Lewis. Although the argument is peaceful, two police officers intervene, and when they see Maverick is Starr’s father, they push him to the ground and search him. Between this scary event and pressure from Kenya, Starr decides that she will no longer be silent.
The District Attorney calls Lisa to announce that a grand jury will hear the case against One-Fifteen and asks if Starr will testify. Starr agrees, and April Ofrah decides to represent Starr pro bono, and also find a way to get Starr a television interview. Meanwhile, DeVante tells Starr that Khalil had never been a member of the King Lords and only sold drugs for King to protect his mother, who had stolen money from King. During Starr’s television interview, she decides, against Ms. Ofrah’s advice, to talk about the truth behind Khalil’s drug dealing. Starr’s implication of King enrages him. The night before her grand jury testimony, someone throws a brick and fires a gun into the Carter household. Unsure if the culprits are the King Lords or the police, Starr almost backs out of testifying. However, she ultimately decides that Khalil needs her truth. She testifies before the grand jury.
Almost two months later, the grand jury announces their decision not to indict One-Fifteen. Starr and some of her friends get caught up in the resulting riots. As she tries to avoid the chaos, Starr stumbles upon a protest led by Ms. Ofrah. She offers Starr the megaphone, and Starr leads a chant in front of the protest. The police try to break up the protest with tear gas. Starr and her friends head to the Carter family store to get milk to help heal their eyes. A Molotov cocktail lands in the store, setting it ablaze and trapping them. Maverick arrives just in time to unlock the back door. King arrives to taunt them, proud about getting his revenge. The police arrive, and King, confident that no one will testify against him, claims ignorance. However, the neighbors rally around the Carter family and tell the police that they saw King throw the Molotov cocktail. The police arrest King. Although the grocery store is in ruins, Starr knows that the family will rebuild. She vows to continue fighting for justice on behalf of Khalil and all other black people killed at the hands of police."
Liquor,"A Raisin in the Sun portrays a few weeks in the life of the Youngers, a Black family living on the South Side of Chicago in the 1950s. When the play opens, the Youngers are about to receive an insurance check for $10,000. This money comes from the deceased Mr. Younger’s life insurance policy. Each of the adult members of the family has an idea as to what he or she would like to do with this money. The matriarch of the family, Mama, wants to buy a house to fulfill a dream she shared with her husband. Mama’s son, Walter Lee, would rather use the money to invest in a liquor store with his friends. He believes that the investment will solve the family’s financial problems forever. Walter’s wife, Ruth, agrees with Mama, however, and hopes that she and Walter can provide more space and opportunity for their son, Travis. Finally, Beneatha, Walter’s sister and Mama’s daughter, wants to use the money for her medical school tuition. She also wishes that her family members were not so interested in assimilating into the white world. Beneatha instead tries to find her identity by looking back to the past and to Africa.
As the play progresses, the Youngers clash over their competing dreams. Ruth discovers that she is pregnant but fears that if she has the child, she will put more financial pressure on her family members. When Walter says nothing to Ruth’s admission that she is considering abortion, Mama puts a down payment on a house for the whole family. She believes that a bigger, brighter dwelling will help them all. This house is in Clybourne Park, an entirely white neighborhood. When the Youngers’ future neighbors find out that the Youngers are moving in, they send Mr. Lindner, from the Clybourne Park Improvement Association, to offer the Youngers money in return for staying away. The Youngers refuse the deal, even after Walter loses the rest of the money ($6,500) to his friend Willy Harris, who persuades Walter to invest in the liquor store and then runs off with his cash.
In the meantime, Beneatha rejects her suitor, George Murchison, whom she believes to be shallow and blind to the problems of race. Subsequently, she receives a marriage proposal from her Nigerian boyfriend, Joseph Asagai, who wants Beneatha to get a medical degree and move to Africa with him (Beneatha does not make her choice before the end of the play). The Youngers eventually move out of the apartment, fulfilling the family’s long-held dream. Their future seems uncertain and slightly dangerous, but they are optimistic and determined to live a better life. They believe that they can succeed if they stick together as a family and resolve to defer their dreams no longer."
Travels,"Gulliver’s Travels recounts the story of Lemuel Gulliver, a practical-minded Englishman trained as a surgeon who takes to the seas when his business fails. In a deadpan first-person narrative that rarely shows any signs of self-reflection or deep emotional response, Gulliver narrates the adventures that befall him on these travels.
Gulliver’s adventure in Lilliput begins when he wakes after his shipwreck to find himself bound by innumerable tiny threads and addressed by tiny captors who are in awe of him but fiercely protective of their kingdom. They are not afraid to use violence against Gulliver, though their arrows are little more than pinpricks. But overall, they are hospitable, risking famine in their land by feeding Gulliver, who consumes more food than a thousand Lilliputians combined could. Gulliver is taken into the capital city by a vast wagon the Lilliputians have specially built. He is presented to the emperor, who is entertained by Gulliver, just as Gulliver is flattered by the attention of royalty. Eventually Gulliver becomes a national resource, used by the army in its war against the people of Blefuscu, whom the Lilliputians hate for doctrinal differences concerning the proper way to crack eggs. But things change when Gulliver is convicted of treason for putting out a fire in the royal palace with his urine and is condemned to be shot in the eyes and starved to death. Gulliver escapes to Blefuscu, where he is able to repair a boat he finds and set sail for England.
After staying in England with his wife and family for two months, Gulliver undertakes his next sea voyage, which takes him to a land of giants called Brobdingnag. Here, a field worker discovers him. The farmer initially treats him as little more than an animal, keeping him for amusement. The farmer eventually sells Gulliver to the queen, who makes him a courtly diversion and is entertained by his musical talents. Social life is easy for Gulliver after his discovery by the court, but not particularly enjoyable. Gulliver is often repulsed by the physicality of the Brobdingnagians, whose ordinary flaws are many times magnified by their huge size. Thus, when a couple of courtly ladies let him play on their naked bodies, he is not attracted to them but rather disgusted by their enormous skin pores and the sound of their torrential urination. He is generally startled by the ignorance of the people here—even the king knows nothing about politics. More unsettling findings in Brobdingnag come in the form of various animals of the realm that endanger his life. Even Brobdingnagian insects leave slimy trails on his food that make eating difficult. On a trip to the frontier, accompanying the royal couple, Gulliver leaves Brobdingnag when his cage is plucked up by an eagle and dropped into the sea.
Next, Gulliver sets sail again and, after an attack by pirates, ends up in Laputa, where a floating island inhabited by theoreticians and academics oppresses the land below, called Balnibarbi. The scientific research undertaken in Laputa and in Balnibarbi seems totally inane and impractical, and its residents too appear wholly out of touch with reality. Taking a short side trip to Glubbdubdrib, Gulliver is able to witness the conjuring up of figures from history, such as Julius Caesar and other military leaders, whom he finds much less impressive than in books. After visiting the Luggnaggians and the Struldbrugs, the latter of which are senile immortals who prove that age does not bring wisdom, he is able to sail to Japan and from there back to England.
Finally, on his fourth journey, Gulliver sets out as captain of a ship, but after the mutiny of his crew and a long confinement in his cabin, he arrives in an unknown land. This land is populated by Houyhnhnms, rational-thinking horses who rule, and by Yahoos, brutish humanlike creatures who serve the Houyhnhnms. Gulliver sets about learning their language, and when he can speak he narrates his voyages to them and explains the constitution of England. He is treated with great courtesy and kindness by the horses and is enlightened by his many conversations with them and by his exposure to their noble culture. He wants to stay with the Houyhnhnms, but his bared body reveals to the horses that he is very much like a Yahoo, and he is banished. Gulliver is grief-stricken but agrees to leave. He fashions a canoe and makes his way to a nearby island, where he is picked up by a Portuguese ship captain who treats him well, though Gulliver cannot help now seeing the captain—and all humans—as shamefully Yahoolike. Gulliver then concludes his narrative with a claim that the lands he has visited belong by rights to England, as her colonies, even though he questions the whole idea of colonialism."
Considerately,"Anne’s diary begins on her thirteenth birthday, June 12, 1942, and ends shortly after her fifteenth. At the start of her diary, Anne describes fairly typical girlhood experiences, writing about her friendships with other girls, her crushes on boys, and her academic performance at school. Because anti-Semitic laws forced Jews into separate schools, Anne and her older sister, Margot, attended the Jewish Lyceum in Amsterdam.
	The Franks had moved to the Netherlands in the years leading up to World War II to escape persecution in Germany. After the Germans invaded the Netherlands in 1940, the Franks were forced into hiding. With another family, the van Daans, and an acquaintance, Mr. Dussel, they moved into a small secret annex above Otto Frank’s office where they had stockpiled food and supplies. The employees from Otto’s firm helped hide the Franks and kept them supplied with food, medicine, and information about the outside world.
	The residents of the annex pay close attention to every development of the war by listening to the radio. Some bits of news catch Anne’s attention and make their way into her diary, providing a vivid historical context for her personal thoughts. The adults make optimistic bets about when the war will end, and their mood is severely affected by Allied setbacks or German advances. Amsterdam is devastated by the war during the two years the Franks are in hiding. All of the city’s residents suffer, since food becomes scarce and robberies more frequent.
	Anne often writes about her feelings of isolation and loneliness. She has a tumultuous relationship with the adults in the annex, particularly her mother, whom she considers lacking in love and affection. She adores her father, but she is frequently scolded and criticized by Mr. and Mrs. van Daan and Mr. Dussel. Anne thinks that her sister, Margot, is smart, pretty, and agreeable, but she does not feel close to her and does not write much about her. Anne eventually develops a close friendship with Peter van Daan, the teenage boy in the annex. Mr. Frank does not approve, however, and the intensity of Anne’s infatuation begins to lessen.
	Anne matures considerably throughout the course of her diary entries, moving from detailed accounts of basic activities to deeper, more profound thoughts about humanity and her own personal nature. She finds it difficult to understand why the Jews are being singled out and persecuted. Anne also confronts her own identity. Though she considers herself to be German, her German citizenship has been revoked, and though she calls Holland her home, many of the Dutch have turned against the Jews. Anne feels a tremendous solidarity with her aggrieved people, and yet at the same time she wants to be seen as an individual rather than a member of a persecuted group.
During the two years recorded in her diary, Anne deals with confinement and deprivation, as well as the complicated and difficult issues of growing up in the brutal circumstances of the Holocaust. Her diary describes a struggle to define herself within this climate of oppression. Anne’s diary ends without comment on August 1, 1944, the end of a seemingly normal day that leaves us with the expectation of seeing another entry on the next page. However, the Frank family is betrayed to the Nazis and arrested on August 4, 1944. Anne’s diary, the observations of an imaginative, friendly, sometimes petty, and rather normal teenage girl, comes to an abrupt and silent end. 
Otto Frank is the family’s sole survivor, and he recovers Anne’s diary from Miep. He decides to fulfill Anne’s wishes by publishing the diary. Anne’s diary becomes a condemnation of the unimaginable horror of the Holocaust, and one of the few accounts that describe it from a young person’s perspective.
	Since Anne’s diary is a true personal account of a life in hiding, it is inappropriate to analyze it as a novel or other work of fiction. Parts of the diary were intended for public view, but others clearly were not. To appreciate and interpret the diary, it is necessary to consider its horrible context, World War II and the Holocaust, before any discussion of plot development or thematic content."
Criminal,"Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov, a former student, lives in a tiny garret on the top floor of a run-down apartment building in St. Petersburg. He is sickly, dressed in rags, short on money, and talks to himself, but he is also handsome, proud, and intelligent. He is contemplating committing an awful crime, but the nature of the crime is not yet clear. He goes to the apartment of an old pawnbroker, Alyona Ivanovna, to get money for a watch and to plan the crime. Afterward, he stops for a drink at a tavern, where he meets a man named Marmeladov, who, in a fit of drunkenness, has abandoned his job and proceeded on a five-day drinking binge, afraid to return home to his family. Marmeladov tells Raskolnikov about his sickly wife, Katerina Ivanovna, and his daughter, Sonya, who has been forced into prostitution to support the family. Raskolnikov walks with Marmeladov to Marmeladov’s apartment, where he meets Katerina and sees firsthand the squalid conditions in which they live.
The next day, Raskolnikov receives a letter from his mother, Pulcheria Alexandrovna, informing him that his sister, Dunya, is engaged to be married to a government official named Luzhin and that they are all moving to St. Petersburg. He goes to another tavern, where he overhears a student talking about how society would be better off if the old pawnbroker Alyona Ivanovna were dead. Later, in the streets, Raskolnikov hears that the pawnbroker will be alone in her apartment the next evening. He sleeps fitfully and wakes up the next day, finds an ax, and fashions a fake item to pawn to distract the pawnbroker. That night, he goes to her apartment and kills her. While he is rummaging through her bedroom, looking for money, her sister, Lizaveta, walks in, and Raskolnikov kills her as well. He barely escapes from the apartment without being seen, then returns to his apartment and collapses on the sofa.
Waking up the next day, Raskolnikov frantically searches his clothing for traces of blood. He receives a summons from the police, but it seems to be unrelated to the murders. At the police station, he learns that his landlady is trying to collect money that he owes her. During a conversation about the murders, Raskolnikov faints, and the police begin to suspect him. Raskolnikov returns to his room, collects the goods that he stole from the pawnbroker, and buries them under a rock in an out-of-the-way courtyard. He visits his friend Razumikhin and refuses his offer of work. Returning to his apartment, Raskolnikov falls into a fitful, nightmare-ridden sleep. After four days of fever and delirium, he wakes up to find out that his housekeeper, Nastasya, and Razumikhin have been taking care of him. He learns that Zossimov, a doctor, and Zamyotov, a young police detective, have also been visiting him. They have all noticed that Raskolnikov becomes extremely uncomfortable whenever the murders of the pawnbroker and her sister are mentioned. Luzhin, Dunya’s fiancé, also makes a visit. After a confrontation with Luzhin, Raskolnikov goes to a café, where he almost confesses to Zamyotov that he is the murderer. Afterward, he impulsively goes to the apartment of the pawnbroker. On his way back home, he discovers that Marmeladov has been run over by a carriage. Raskolnikov helps to carry him back to his apartment, where Marmeladov dies. At the apartment, he meets Sonya and gives the family twenty rubles that he received from his mother. Returning with Razumikhin to his own apartment, Raskolnikov faints when he discovers that his sister and mother are there waiting for him.
Raskolnikov becomes annoyed with Pulcheria Alexandrovna and Dunya and orders them out of the room. He also commands Dunya to break her engagement with Luzhin. Razumikhin, meanwhile, falls in love with Dunya. The next morning, Razumikhin tries to explain Raskolnikov’s character to Dunya and Pulcheria Alexandrovna, and then the three return to Raskolnikov’s apartment. There, Zossimov greets them and tells them that Raskolnikov’s condition is much improved. Raskolnikov apologizes for his behavior the night before and confesses to giving all his money to the Marmeladovs. But he soon grows angry and irritable again and demands that Dunya not marry Luzhin. Dunya tells him that she is meeting with Luzhin that evening, and that although Luzhin has requested specifically that Raskolnikov not be there, she would like him to come nevertheless. Raskolnikov agrees. At that moment, Sonya enters the room, greatly embarrassed to be in the presence of Raskolnikov’s family. She invites Raskolnikov to her father’s funeral, and he accepts. On her way back to her apartment, Sonya is followed by a strange man, who we later learn is Svidrigailov—Dunya’s lecherous former employer who is obsessively attracted to her.
Under the pretense of trying to recover a watch he pawned, Raskolnikov visits the magistrate in charge of the murder investigation, Porfiry Petrovich, a relative of Razumikhin’s. Zamyotov is at the detective’s house when Raskolnikov arrives. Raskolnikov and Porfiry have a tense conversation about the murders. Raskolnikov starts to believe that Porfiry suspects him and is trying to lead him into a trap. Afterward, Raskolnikov and Razumikhin discuss the conversation, trying to figure out if Porfiry suspects him. When Raskolnikov returns to his apartment, he learns that a man had come there looking for him. When he catches up to the man in the street, the man calls him a murderer. That night Raskolnikov dreams about the pawnbroker’s murder. When he wakes up, there is a stranger in the room.
The stranger is Svidrigailov. He explains that he would like Dunya to break her engagement with Luzhin, whom he esteems unworthy of her. He offers to give Dunya the enormous sum of ten thousand rubles. He also tells Raskolnikov that his late wife, Marfa Petrovna, left Dunya three thousand rubles in her will. Raskolnikov rejects Svidrigailov’s offer of money and, after hearing him talk about seeing the ghost of Marfa, suspects that he is insane. After Svidrigailov leaves, Raskolnikov and Razumikhin walk to a restaurant to meet Dunya, Pulcheria Alexandrovna, and Luzhin. Razumikhin tells Raskolnikov that he is certain that the police suspect Raskolnikov. Luzhin is insulted to find that Raskolnikov, contrary to his wishes, is in attendance at the meal. They discuss Svidrigailov’s arrival in the city and the money that has been offered to Dunya. Luzhin and Raskolnikov get into an argument, during the course of which Luzhin offends everyone in the room, including his fiancée and prospective mother-in-law. Dunya breaks the engagement and forces him to leave. Everyone is overjoyed at his departure. Razumikhin starts to talk about plans to go into the publishing business as a family, but Raskolnikov ruins the mood by telling them that he does not want to see them anymore. When Raskolnikov leaves the room, Razumikhin chases him down the stairs. They stop, face-to-face, and Razumikhin realizes, without a word being spoken, that Raskolnikov is guilty of the murders. He rushes back to Dunya and Pulcheria Alexandrovna to reassure them that he will help them through whatever difficulties they encounter.
Raskolnikov goes to the apartment of Sonya Marmeladov. During their conversation, he learns that Sonya was a friend of one of his victims, Lizaveta. He forces Sonya to read to him the biblical story of Lazarus, who was resurrected by Jesus. Meanwhile, Svidrigailov eavesdrops from the apartment next door.
The following morning, Raskolnikov visits Porfiry Petrovich at the police department, supposedly in order to turn in a formal request for his pawned watch. As they converse, Raskolnikov starts to feel again that Porfiry is trying to lead him into a trap. Eventually, he breaks under the pressure and accuses Porfiry of playing psychological games with him. At the height of tension between them, Nikolai, a workman who is being held under suspicion for the murders, bursts into the room and confesses to the murders. On the way to Katerina Ivanovna’s memorial dinner for Marmeladov, Raskolnikov meets the mysterious man who called him a murderer and learns that the man actually knows very little about the case.
The scene shifts to the apartment of Luzhin and his roommate, Lebezyatnikov, where Luzhin is nursing his hatred for Raskolnikov, whom he blames for the breaking of his engagement to Dunya. Although Luzhin has been invited to Marmeladov’s memorial dinner, he refuses to go. He invites Sonya to his room and gives her a ten-ruble bill. Katerina’s memorial dinner goes poorly. The widow is extremely fussy and proud, but few guests have shown up, and, except for Raskolnikov, those that have are drunk and crude. Luzhin then enters the room and accuses Sonya of stealing a one-hundred-ruble bill. Sonya denies his claim, but the bill is discovered in one of her pockets. Just as everyone is about to label Sonya a thief, however, Lebezyatnikov enters and tells the room that he saw Luzhin slip the bill into Sonya’s pocket as she was leaving his room. Raskolnikov explains that Luzhin was probably trying to embarrass him by discrediting Sonya. Luzhin leaves, and a fight breaks out between Katerina and her landlady.
After the dinner, Raskolnikov goes to Sonya’s room and confesses the murders to her. They have a long conversation about his confused motives. Sonya tries to convince him to confess to the authorities. Lebezyatnikov then enters and informs them that Katerina Ivanovna seems to have gone mad—she is parading the children in the streets, begging for money. Sonya rushes out to find them while Raskolnikov goes back to his room and talks to Dunya. He soon returns to the street and sees Katerina dancing and singing wildly. She collapses after a confrontation with a policeman and, soon after being brought back to her room, dies. Svidrigailov appears and offers to pay for the funeral and the care of the children. He reveals to Raskolnikov that he knows Raskolnikov is the murderer.
Raskolnikov wanders around in a haze after his confession to Sonya and the death of Katerina. Razumikhin confronts him in his room, asking him whether he has gone mad and telling him of the pain that he has caused his mother and sister. After their conversation, Porfiry Petrovich appears and apologizes for his treatment of Raskolnikov in the police station. Nonetheless, he does not believe Nikolai’s confession. He accuses Raskolnikov of the murders but admits that he does not have enough evidence to arrest him. Finally, he urges him to confess, telling him that he will receive a lighter sentence if he does so. Raskolnikov goes looking for Svidrigailov, eventually finding him in a café. Svidrigailov tells him that though he is still attracted to Dunya, he has gotten engaged to a sixteen-year-old girl. Svidrigailov parts from Raskolnikov and manages to bring Dunya to his room, where he threatens to rape her after she refuses to marry him. She fires several shots at him with a revolver and misses, but when he sees how strongly she dislikes him, he allows her to leave. He takes her revolver and wanders aimlessly around St. Petersburg. He gives three thousand rubles to Dunya, fifteen thousand rubles to the family of his fiancée, and then books a room in a hotel. He sleeps fitfully and dreams of a flood and a seductive five-year-old girl. In the morning, he kills himself.
Raskolnikov, who is visiting his mother, tells her that he will always love her and then returns to his room, where he tells Dunya that he is planning to confess. After she leaves, he goes to visit Sonya, who gives him a cross to wear. On the way to the police station, he stops in a marketplace and kisses the ground. He almost pulls back from confessing when he reaches the police station and learns of Svidrigailov’s suicide. The sight of Sonya, however, convinces him to go through with it, and he confesses to one of the police officials, Ilya Petrovich.
A year and a half later, Raskolnikov is in prison in Siberia, where he has been for nine months. Sonya has moved to the town outside the prison, and she visits Raskolnikov regularly and tries to ease his burden. Because of his confession, his mental confusion surrounding the murders, and testimony about his past good deeds, he has received, instead of a death sentence, a reduced sentence of eight years of hard labor in Siberia. After Raskolnikov’s arrest, his mother became delirious and died. Razumikhin and Dunya were married. For a short while, Raskolnikov remains as proud and alienated from humanity as he was before his confession, but he eventually realizes that he truly loves Sonya and expresses remorse for his crime."
Renewal,"Regeneration begins with Siegfried Sassoon's open letter, dated July 1917, protesting the conduct and insincerities of the First World War. The letter has been published in the London Times and has received much attention in England, as many people are upset over the length and toll of the war thus far. The army is not sure what to do with Sassoon, as his letter clearly threatens to undermine the strength of the war effort at home.
With the string-pulling and guidance of Robert Graves, a fellow poet and friend of Sassoon, the Board agrees to send Sassoon to Craiglockhart War Hospital—a mental facility in Scotland—rather than court-marshaling him. Sassoon is at first hesitant to agree to this, since he (rightly) fears that being committed to a mental hospital will undermine his cause; however, convinced by Graves that there is no other option, Sassoon agrees.
At Craiglockhart, Sassoon meets with Dr. W.H.R. Rivers, a former anthropologist turned psychiatrist who encourages his patients to express their war memories so that they can heal their ""nerves."" Though Rivers can sympathize with the strong dislike of the horrors of war, he believes it is his duty to encourage Sassoon to return to France to fight.
There are many soldiers with various problems and ailments in the hospital. Burns, an emaciated man, has been unable to eat since a shell threw him into the gas-filled stomach of a German corpse. Anderson, a former war surgeon, is now terrified at the sight of blood, and is worried about resuming his civilian medical practice. Prior, a young, stubborn, and slightly difficult patient, enters the hospital suffering from mutism. Rivers meets with each of them in turn, helping them to recover from their problems.
One stormy night, Burns leaves the hospital, makes a trip far into the countryside, and comes across a tree with dead animals hanging from it. He is at first frightened, but he then starts removing the animals from the branches one by one and arranging them in a circle. Burns lies down in the middle of the circle, naked, and he feels soothed. Eventually, Burns returns to the hospital, but no one finds out about this episode.
Dr. Rivers is personally and emotionally tied to the welfare of his patients. One night, he has a nightmare about old nerve regeneration experiments he used to conduct with his old friend, Henry Head. At Cambridge, the two had severed a nerve in Head's hand with the purpose of charting its gradual regeneration. Rivers still feels guilty about the pain he inflicted on his friend, as well as the pain he inflicts on his patients by forcing them to talk about their war experiences.
Sassoon's letter is read in the House of Commons and is dismissed, as he is considered mentally unstable. Though Sassoon expected this result, he is still saddened and disappointed by the news. Slowly, he begins to become friends with another patient in the hospital, Wilfred Owen. Owen is also a poet and he greatly respects Sassoon's work; Sassoon agrees to help Owen with his poetry.
Prior, who has regained his voice, finds his way to a pub in Edinburgh where he meets a young munitions worker named Sarah Lumb. They strike up an acquaintance and agree to see each other again. When Prior returns to the hospital, Rivers tries hypnosis on Prior to see if it enables him to remember the tragic events that led to his breakdown. The hypnosis works, and Prior remembers in vivid detail having to shovel his men's remains after they were killed by a shell. Prior's memories anger and upset him. The next week, Prior takes Sarah to a seaside town where they see crowds of people walking on the beach. Prior envies and resents the way these people can just escape from the war. A storm comes, and Prior and Sarah make love under the shelter of a thornbush.
After a very busy day, Rivers wakes up in the middle of the night with chest pain; his doctor insists that he take three weeks vacation. During these three weeks, he visits his brother's house and reflects on his relationship with his deceased father. Rivers then visits his old friend Henry Head, who offers him a terrific job at a war hospital in London. Finally Rivers visits Burns's house in Suffolk for a few days. The Review Board has given Burns an unconditional discharge from the army. While at Suffolk, Burns has an episode and tries to commit suicide by hiding in a hole that floods at high tide. Rivers finds Burns, however, and saves him.
Back at Craiglockhart, the Board has granted Prior permanent home service; he will not have to return to the war. Prior sneaks into Sarah's room and tells her the news. Though they are both skeptical about love, they agree to give their relationship a try. Meanwhile, Sassoon has also come to a very important decision. Although he still disagrees with the brutality and suffering of the war, he decides to return to France in order to care for his men. Both Graves and Rivers are pleased with this decision.
Dr. Rivers decides to take the job in London, and leaves Craiglockhart in glory (Willard, one of his patients, has overcome his mental block and is now able to walk again). In London, Rivers is fascinated by his new work. Dr. Yealland, another psychiatrist specializing in war patients, invites Rivers to the National Hospital to come on his rounds. Rivers watches one of Yealland's horrific electro-shock therapy sessions on a patient named Callan. That night, Rivers has a nightmare that he is shoving a horse's bit into Sassoon's mouth, similar to the way Yealland shoved the electrode into the patient's mouth.
Rivers returns to Craiglockhart for a monthly Review Board meeting. The Board grants Anderson a desk position in the War Office and discharges Sassoon to duty, to return to France to fight. As Rivers says farewell to Sassoon, he realizes how much his own views about the war have changed."
