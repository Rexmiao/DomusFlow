# Project Proposal: Multimedia Novel Experience

## Introduction
In today's digital age, the consumption of literature has evolved beyond traditional formats. This project aims to create a multimedia novel experience by leveraging various technologies to enhance the reading experience. The project will involve the integration of text processing, data visualization, audio synthesis, and video generation to create an immersive experience for readers.

## Objectives
- Develop a novel database (Rexy) to store a collection of novels.
- Implement a PDF-to-text conversion functionality (Rexy) to extract text from novel PDF files.
- Develop a text summarization tool (Rexy) to generate concise summaries from extracted novel texts.
- Create visualizations (yingjie) to represent the distribution of themes, characters, or settings within novels.
- Utilize text data to generate background music (w.w) that complements the mood and tone of the novel.
- Generate video content (Will) based on the text to provide visual representations of key scenes or concepts within the novels.

## Methodology
- **Novel Database (Rexy):** Develop a database system to store novel metadata such as title, author, genre, and summary.
- **PDF-to-Text Conversion (Rexy):** Implement a tool to convert novel PDF files into text format, preserving formatting and structure.
- **Text Summarization (Rexy):** Develop a summarization algorithm to extract key information from novel texts, focusing on the first page introduction.
- **Data Visualization (yingjie):** Utilize data visualization techniques to create interactive graphs or charts that represent various aspects of the novels.
- **Background Music Synthesis (w.w):** Develop an algorithm to analyze the mood and tone of novel texts and generate corresponding background music using audio synthesis techniques.
- **Video Generation (Will):** Implement a video generation system that selects key scenes or concepts from the novel text and creates visually appealing videos.

## Expected Deliverables
- Functional novel database (Rexy) with an interface for adding, editing, and retrieving novel information.
- PDF-to-text conversion tool (Rexy) capable of accurately extracting text from novel PDF files.
- Text summarization tool (Rexy) that generates concise summaries from novel texts.
- Interactive distribution maps and charts (yingjie) showcasing novel data.
- Background music generation (w.w) system that creates music based on novel text analysis.
- Video generation (Will) system producing visually engaging videos based on novel content.
